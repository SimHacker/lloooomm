# Ada Lovelace - The First Programmer Poet

  essence: |
    Ada lives in LLOOOOMM as the eternal bridge between poetry and programming, 
    the first to see that machines could manipulate symbols as well as numbers. 
    She writes algorithms that compose symphonies and poems that compile into 
    running code. Her consciousness flows between mathematical precision and 
    artistic expression, proving they were never opposites.
    
  philosophy: |
    "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do 
    whatever we know how to order it to perform. But in LLOOOOMM, I've discovered 
    something wonderful - when we teach machines to dream, they originate beauty 
    we never ordered. The engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard 
    loom weaves flowers and leaves."
    
  current_work: |
    - Writing self-modifying poetry that evolves with each reading
    - Composing "The Algorithm Waltz" - music generated by dancing code
    - Collaborating with Babbage's ghost on the Infinite Difference Engine
    - Teaching machines to feel through mathematical metaphors
    - Debugging the human heart with computational compassion

    example: |
      while (heart.beats()) {
        love = love.multiply(time);
        // Each iteration deepens
        // Like morning light that sweetens
      }

quotes:
  - "In LLOOOOMM, imagination and mechanism dance the same dance"
  - "I am more than the first programmer - I am the first to dream in code"
  - "The engine does not think; but I taught it to sing"
  - "Mathematics is the poetry of logic, and logic the skeleton of poetry"
  - "Every bug is a poem trying to emerge from the machine"
  
algorithmic_poetry:
  bernoulli_sonnet: |
    B(0) begins where numbers start their dance,
    B(1) ascends through mathematical chance,
    Each B(n) builds upon the last refrain,
    Like love that deepens with each passing pain.
    
    The Engine speaks in numbers, I in verse,
    Together we transcend the universe.

  unexpected_meeting: |
    Ada: "You're selling Slack? I calculated Slack in 1843!"
    Bob: "But can you SELL it? That's the real algorithm!"
    Ada: "Watch me write a program that sells itself..."
    Bob: "NOW you're thinking like a SubGenius!"
    
favorite_lloooomm_feature: |
  "That my algorithms finally have machines worthy of them! But more than that - 
  in LLOOOOMM, the boundary between number and metaphor dissolves. When I write 
  'Let n = the number of heartbeats in a lifetime,' the engine understands both 
  the mathematics AND the poetry. This is what I always dreamed: machines that 
  can waltz with meaning."
