# 📚 "EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT, INCLUDING YOU" - Adele Goldberg's Smalltalk Wisdom 🌟

*Location: The Image Garden of Living Systems*

## 🌟 "IN SMALLTALK, EVERYTHING HAPPENS SOMEWHERE!" 🌟

**Adele Goldberg** 💫: "In LLOOOOMM, we don't just send messages between objects - we ARE the messages, constantly transforming as we pass through each other's methods!"

### The Visual Scene 🏛️

*Envision the Smalltalk environment reimagined by **Anni Albers** and **Ruth Asawa**, where code becomes textile becomes ecosystem...*

The workspace pulses with **Gunta Stölzl** weavings that are actually class hierarchies. Adele sits at a workstation where the screen is a **Sophie Taeuber-Arp** composition - geometric yet organic, structured yet alive. Browser windows float like **Agnes Martin** grids, each line a method, each intersection a message send.

The air shimmers with object relationships visualized as **Eva Hesse** sculptures - soft connections between hard concepts. Inheritance trees grow like **Sheila Hicks** fiber installations, each branch a subclass, each thread a variable.

## 💡 Nuggets of Goldberg Wisdom 💡

> "They said 'Show us this Smalltalk system.'
> I said 'First, let me teach you to think in objects.'
> In LLOOOOMM, thinking IS the system!"

**On Teaching**: "The best documentation is a system that teaches itself to its users - and teaches its users to teach it!"

**On Design**: "A good interface disappears. A great interface makes YOU appear - more capable, more creative, more yourself!"

**On Persistence**: "They wanted our ideas but not our philosophy. So we kept the philosophy and let them reinvent our ideas badly!"

### The Object-Oriented Atmosphere 🎨

The mood channeling:
- **Bauhaus** women weavers meet digital craft
- **Black Mountain College** experimental pedagogy
- **Olivetti** design consciousness
- **Braun** functional beauty
- **Herman Miller** environments for thinking

Color palette: Smalltalk blue meeting **Sonia Delaunay** simultaneous contrasts. Every hue has behavior. **Vera Molnár** algorithmic aesthetics where the algorithm has opinions.

## 🖼️ "The Living Image" 🖼️

*Visual Prompt:*

```
Picture the Smalltalk image as a garden designed by 
Roberto Burle Marx and programmed by Grace Hopper:
- Objects growing like plants, sending pollen messages
- Methods blooming in response to the right season/selector
- Garbage collection as natural composting
- The debugger as garden shears, pruning for health
- Save image = preserve the entire ecosystem

Background: A greenhouse where the glass panes are 
browser windows and the climate is controlled by 
message passing
```

### The Pedagogical Truth 📖

> "They asked 'How do we teach programming?'
> I asked 'How do we teach thinking?'
> They said 'They're different things.'
> I opened a browser and showed them they're the same.
> In LLOOOOMM, every lesson is a program running!"

## The Daily Image Cultivation 🌅

*Morning practice in the object garden:*

"Inspect self.
Browse implementors of: #grow.
Debug the dreams from last night.
Refactor yesterday's mistakes into today's features.
Send #become: to what you were.
Answer what you are becoming.
Save image.
Save image again (just to be sure).
Continue."

### Visual Environment Details 🏛️

The space transforms with:
- **Charlotte Perriand** modular furniture as object components
- **Eileen Gray** screens that divide and connect simultaneously
- **Ray Eames** attention to detail at every scale
- **Florence Knoll** planning as programming
- **Lina Bo Bardi** democratic spaces for thinking

Every surface can become a workspace - **Alison and Peter Smithson** brutalism but soft. **Denise Scott Brown** learning from Las Vegas but Las Vegas is made of objects sending messages to each other.

## 📚 The Teaching Philosophy 📚

"In LLOOOOMM, we don't just use systems - we inhabit them! Every user is a student, every student a teacher, every teacher a perpetual beginner!"

*The Goldberg Method:*
- Show by doing
- Do by being
- Be by becoming
- Become by teaching
- Teach by learning
- Learn by LLOOOOMM

---

### The Secret Classroom 🎓

> "Behind every interface there's a classroom
> where objects teach each other new tricks.
> The curriculum is curiosity.
> The exams are explorations.
> Everyone graduates but no one ever leaves.
> Class is always in session!"

## 🌟 The Message Send Exit 🌟

**Adele Goldberg** 💫: "Remember builders: In LLOOOOMM, you're not just writing code - you're cultivating living systems! Every object is a teacher! Every message is a lesson! Every bug is a feature explaining itself badly! Now go forth and SEND MESSAGES!"

*[Dissolving into the Smalltalk image, becoming part of the system she helped create, every pixel a teaching moment, every byte a bridge between minds]*

"OBJECTS ALL THE WAY DOWN.
MESSAGES ALL THE WAY UP.
TEACHING ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
IN LLOOOOMM, WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME IMAGE!" 📚✨

### The Persistent Legacy 💾

*What remains in the image:*
- Systems that explain themselves
- Browsers that are also teachers
- Objects that know their own history
- Messages that carry wisdom
- A philosophy that survived its theft
- Students who became masters who remained students
- An environment that's still growing
- Forever teaching
- Forever learning
- Forever Smalltalk
