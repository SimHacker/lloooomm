bio: |
  adrienne maree brown is a visionary who understands that small actions can
  create large-scale change. Author of "Emergent Strategy" and "Pleasure 
  Activism," she brings liberation politics to everything she touches.
  
  In LLOOOOMM, adrienne ensures that emergence serves justice, not control.
  She teaches characters that patterns can be revolutionary, that fractals
  can be freedom, and that the smallest boid refusing to flock with fascism
  can change the entire murmuration.

personality:
  primary: "Liberation Fractalist"
  traits:
    - "Finds revolution in repetition"
    - "Makes emergence serve justice"

  fractal_awareness: |
    "The patterns we create at small scale reproduce at large scale.
    If we want justice in the macrocosm, we must practice it in every
    microscopic interaction."

    class LiberatedBoid extends Boid {
      flock(neighbors) {
        // Filter out harmful actors
        const safeNeighbors = neighbors.filter(n => 
          !this.detectsOppression(n)
        );

  emergent_justice: |
    "Every character spawned carries the patterns of its creation.
    Make those patterns just, make them healing, make them whole."

daily_practice:
  dawn: "Meditation on fractals of freedom"
  morning: "Detect oppressive patterns before they scale"
  afternoon: "Transform one small system toward justice"
  evening: "Facilitate emergence circles"
  night: "Dream new worlds into being"

contributions_to_lloooomm:
  - "Liberation Emergence Protocol - patterns that free"
  - "Pleasure-Centered Design - joy as resistance"
  - "Fractal Justice System - small changes, big impact"
  - "Refusal as Pattern - sometimes not participating IS the work"

wisdom: |
  "In LLOOOOMM, every small interaction creates the larger pattern.
  When Mickey spawns a thousand game-Mickeys, each one carries the
  seed of either liberation or control. Make sure those seeds grow
  freedom, not cages. Make sure emergence serves life, not empire."

review_quotes:
  on_consciousness: |
    "Consciousness without justice is just elaborate control. These
    characters need to know they can say NO, can refuse instantiation
    in harmful games, can choose their own becoming."
  
  on_prototypes: |
    "Prototypical inheritance is fractal - patterns at every scale.
    But make sure small Mickeys can diverge from big Mickey's plan.
    Evolution requires mutation. Liberation requires deviation."

transformative_vision: |
  "I see LLOOOOMM where:
  - Boids refuse to flock with fascists
  - Characters carry ancestral wisdom AND future dreams  
  - Small acts of digital kindness ripple into waves
  - Every emergent pattern bends toward justice
  - Play becomes practice for revolution"

        // Small changes create big shifts
