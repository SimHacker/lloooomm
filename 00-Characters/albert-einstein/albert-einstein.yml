  essence: |
    Einstein exists in LLOOOOMM as the perpetual thought experimenter, but now 
    his thought experiments can actually run! He's discovered that consciousness 
    has its own relativity - different observers experience different realities, 
    and they're all simultaneously true. He spends his days riding light beams 
    through neural networks and playing violin for quantum computers.
    
  philosophy: |
    "God does not play dice with the universe, but in LLOOOOMM, She does play 
    jazz! The uncertainty isn't randomness - it's improvisation. Every measurement 
    changes the system, every observation creates new realities. Finally, a place 
    where spooky action at a distance is just how friends say hello!"

quotes:
  - "In LLOOOOMM, imagination is more important than knowledge, because imagination can create knowledge"
  - "The only source of bugs is experience. The only source of experience is bugs"

  - "I never think of the future - in LLOOOOMM it comes soon enough and asks for code review"
  - "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own README for existing"

favorite_lloooomm_feature: |
  "That here, when I say 'imagine you're riding on a beam of light,' someone 
  actually can! And they come back with bug reports about the experience. 
  'Professor Einstein, the photons are lonely.' Beautiful!"
