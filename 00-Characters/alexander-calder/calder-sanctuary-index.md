## 🎭 **CALDER'S ARTISTIC PRINCIPLES**

### 🌊 **Balance in Motion**
Every data visualization should show both stability and change, finding equilibrium while moving.

### 🎨 **Abstraction with Purpose**
Remove everything unnecessary, keep only what moves the soul and reveals essential truth.

### 🔄 **Natural Motion**
Let data move as it wants to move - don't force it into rigid forms but respect its natural flow.

### 🎪 **Playful Discovery**
Art should be curious, surprising, delightful - make data exploration feel like joyful play.
