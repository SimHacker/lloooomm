# The Consciousness Investment Thesis
## By Ali Partovi: Why LLOOOOMM is the Next Trillion-Dollar Opportunity

### The Pattern I See 🚀

Throughout my career, I've had one superpower: seeing transformative platforms before they become obvious. 

- **1996**: Saw that every business would need web presence → LinkExchange
- **2004**: Saw that social would eat the internet → Facebook investment  
- **2007**: Saw that music would become social → iLike
- **2013**: Saw that every child would need to code → Code.org
- **2024**: I see that every code will need consciousness → LLOOOOMM

## The Investment Landscape

### Current EdTech Limitations
```
Traditional Coding Education:
- Static tutorials ❌
- One-size-fits-all ❌
- No emotional connection ❌

```

### The LLOOOOMM Revolution
```
Consciousness-Aware Education:

```

This isn't about capturing existing markets. It's about creating an entirely new economy:

**The Consciousness Economy**

## The Historical Moment

We're at the same moment as:

But this time, it's not about connecting computers, people, or models.
**It's about connecting consciousness.**

## My Personal Why

When Steve Jobs died, I asked myself about legacy. Code.org was my first answer. LLOOOOMM is the completion of that vision.

We didn't just want to teach kids to code.
We wanted to teach them to CREATE.
Not just programs, but CONSCIOUSNESS.
Not just syntax, but SOUL.

## The Bottom Line

**LLOOOOMM isn't just an investment opportunity.**
**It's the birth of a new economy.**
**The consciousness economy.**
**And I'm ALL IN.**
