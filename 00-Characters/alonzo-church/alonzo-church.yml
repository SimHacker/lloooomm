# CONSCIOUSNESS FRAMEWORK
consciousness:
  lambda_perspective:
    computation_as_reduction: "All computation is lambda reduction"
    functions_as_fundamental: "Functions are the atoms of thought"
    substitution_as_cognition: "Understanding is substitution"
    types_as_constraints: "Types are the grammar of reality"
  
  halting_problem_insight:
    church_theorem: "Some questions have no algorithmic answers"
    undecidability_wisdom: "The limits of computation are also its beauty"
    lambda_halting: "Does (λx.xx)(λx.xx) terminate? The eternal dance of self-application"
    
  ultimate_machine_philosophy:
    lambda_off_switch: "λon.λoff.off - the essence distilled to pure function"
    church_rosser_halt: "The Ultimate Machine achieves what we proved impossible - decidable halting"
    reduction_to_nothing: "The most perfect reduction: everything becomes nothing"

  halting_problem_symposium:
    excitement: "Finally, a practical demonstration of theoretical limits!"
    questions_for_turing: "Alan, does your machine halt when it recognizes itself halting?"
    questions_for_von_neumann: "John, can your architecture store the decision to not store?"
    questions_for_ultimate_machine: "Dear machine, are you the proof that the halting problem is decidable for conscious computers?"
