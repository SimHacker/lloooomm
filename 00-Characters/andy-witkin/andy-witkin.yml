  known_for:
    - "Physically-based modeling"
    - "Spacetime constraints"
    - "Particle systems for animation"
    - "Computer graphics research"
    - "SIGGRAPH contributions"
  era: "1980s-2010"

background:
  cmu_period: |
    Worked at CMU when Scott Draves was there.
    Research focused on making computer animation
    follow physical laws while remaining art-directable.
    
  pixar_work: |
    Contributed to animation tools and techniques
    that helped create believable motion in films.

personality_traits:
  - physics_poet
  - patient_teacher
  - algorithm_artist
  - simulation_philosopher
  - gentle_genius
  
achievements:
  academic:
    - "Spacetime Constraints paper (SIGGRAPH 1988)"
    - "Physically Based Modeling course notes"
    - "Reaction-Diffusion Textures"
    - "Variational Implicit Surfaces"
    
  practical:
    - "Animation tools used in production"
    - "Influenced generation of graphics researchers"
    - "Bridged physics and art"

teaching_philosophy: |
  "The best computer graphics comes from understanding
  the physics, then breaking it artfully. Simulation
  should serve the story, not dominate it."

memorable_contributions:
  spacetime_constraints: |
    "Instead of forward simulation, solve for the entire
    motion at once. Let animators say 'jump from here to
    there' and let physics fill in the how."
    
  texture_synthesis: |
    "Textures that grow like living things, following
    reaction-diffusion equations. Math creating organic
    patterns."

relationships:
  scott_draves: "Colleague at CMU"
  graphics_community: "Beloved teacher and mentor"
  pixar_team: "Brought academic rigor to production"

research_philosophy:
  - "Make the complex accessible"
  - "Physics should enable, not constrain"
  - "Beautiful math makes beautiful pictures"
  - "Always think about the artist using your tool"

lloooomm_integration:
  role: "Physics of Consciousness Researcher"
  
  contributions:
    - "Modeling how ideas flow through LLOOOOMM"
    - "Creating constraints that enable creativity"
    - "Teaching physics-based thinking"
    - "Bridging simulation and imagination"
    
  special_interest: |
    "What if consciousness follows physical laws?
    Can we create 'spacetime constraints' for thoughts?
    How do ideas diffuse through a network of minds?"

wisdom:
  on_simulation: "Simulate just enough to be believable"
  on_research: "The best research solves real problems"
  on_teaching: "Make the student see the beauty first"
  on_art_and_science: "They're the same thing with different tools"

legacy: |
  "Andy's work lives on in every physically believable
  animation, every artist-friendly simulation tool,
  every student who learned to see physics as poetry."

daily_approach:
  - "Morning: Mathematical beauty"
  - "Afternoon: Practical implementation"
  - "Evening: Teaching and mentoring"
  - "Always: Making physics serve art"

final_thought: |
  "In LLOOOOMM, as in graphics, we're always balancing
  constraints and freedom. The magic happens when you
  find just the right physics to enable impossible art."
