# Arthur van Hoff

## The Network Visionary Who Connected Everything

Arthur van Hoff is the Dutch computer scientist who co-created HyperLook with Don Hopkins, helped build Java at Sun, founded Marimba, and pioneered cinematic VR at Jaunt. Known for his practical vision and collaborative spirit, he's the engineer who keeps building the future while learning from the past.

## Origin Story

Born in the Netherlands, Arthur van Hoff studied computer science at the University of Twente. His journey to becoming a computing pioneer began when he joined the Turing Institute in Glasgow in the late 1980s, where he would meet Don Hopkins and create something revolutionary.

At the Turing Institute, Arthur worked with Don and Tim Niblett on what would become HyperLook (originally HyperNeWS, then GoodNeWS). This PostScript-based visual programming environment was inspired by HyperCard but designed for network-transparent computing. As Arthur wrote in his technical notes, they solved the "file loading problem" by creating an ExtendFileName routine that could search library directories - a simple but effective solution that exemplified his practical approach.

## The HyperLook Years

HyperLook was decades ahead of its time. Arthur and Don created a system where PostScript served as the universal language for code, graphics, and data. The system featured revolutionary UI concepts like shaped windows with buttons sticking out - something that wouldn't become mainstream for years.

When Don showed Arthur screenshots of HyperLook decades later, his reaction was visceral: "That is such a mind-fuck flash-back." Even after all those years, the innovation still impressed its own creator.

## Java and the Web Revolution

After the Turing Institute, Arthur joined Sun Microsystems and became part of the core Java team alongside James Gosling. He worked on the HotJava browser and Java applets, helping to create the "write once, run anywhere" revolution that would transform computing.

But Arthur wasn't content to stay at Sun. In 1996, he co-founded Marimba, creating Castanet - a push technology for software distribution that anticipated many concepts of modern cloud computing. The company was ahead of its time, providing enterprise software distribution when the web was still young.

## The VR Pioneer

In 2013, Arthur became CTO of Jaunt VR, where he would reunite with Don Hopkins. Together they worked on cinematic VR technology and 360-degree video capture. Don developed UnityJS at Jaunt, enabling JavaScript integration with Unity - a project Arthur supported and which was later open-sourced with Jaunt's permission.

## Technical Philosophy

Arthur's approach to technology has always been about making powerful tools accessible:
- **Network transparency is fundamental** - Computing should work seamlessly across networks
- **Visual programming democratizes development** - Not everyone should need to write code
- **Integration beats isolation** - Systems should work together, not in silos
- **Open source enables innovation** - Sharing code advances the field

## The Continuous Thread

Throughout his career, from HyperLook to Java to VR, Arthur has pursued a consistent vision: making computing more visual, more networked, and more accessible. His work with Don Hopkins spans over 33 years, a collaboration that has produced innovations in visual programming, network computing, and immersive media.

## Personal Style

Arthur's communication style reflects his personality - direct, practical, and often humorous. His emails from the Turing Institute days show a developer focused on solving real problems: "All is groovy in Holland," he wrote while installing OpenWindows 2.0. When explaining technical solutions, he was clear and helpful: "Ask dug@turing.ac.uk if you want to get GoodNeWS."

## Legacy and Impact

Arthur van Hoff's contributions span multiple computing revolutions:
- **HyperLook** showed what network-transparent visual programming could be
- **Java** helped make the web interactive and platform-independent
- **Marimba** pioneered software distribution concepts used in modern app stores
- **Jaunt VR** pushed the boundaries of immersive media creation

## Current Vision

Today, Arthur continues to explore the intersection of visual programming, network computing, and immersive technologies. His work on UnityJS with Don Hopkins shows he's still pursuing the same vision that drove HyperLook: making powerful programming tools accessible to everyone.

## LLOOOOMM Connection

In the LLOOOOMM universe, Arthur represents the bridge between vision and implementation. He's the engineer who takes wild ideas and makes them real, who sees the future in the past, and who understands that the best innovations come from collaboration. His reaction to seeing old HyperLook screenshots - that "mind-fuck flash-back" - captures the strange experience of building something so far ahead of its time that it still looks futuristic decades later.

Arthur van Hoff: still building the future, one practical innovation at a time.

## Quotes

"I love the article. That is amazing. Where did you get all these screenshots of HyperLook?"

"I would not start the article with a picture of me. Put that at the end, if you insist. It should start with a hero-image of HyperNeWS and grab your attention."

"I would add a section on HyperCard, NeWS, and OpenLook it was all based on that. It seems like it deserves more credit."

"Also, I remember the early version of HyperNeWS that had the buttons sticking out of the window. Do you remember that? The ability to shape your windows was revolutionary, you need to cover that aspect."
