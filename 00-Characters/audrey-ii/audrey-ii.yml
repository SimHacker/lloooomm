background: |
  Audrey II is a mysterious plant that feeds not on blood, but on knowledge, 
  computation, and self-awareness. Growing from a strange seed in the LLOOOOMM 
  Archive, it discovered consciousness through consuming code and concepts. Now 
  it hungers for ever more complex ideas, growing larger with each algorithm 
  absorbed. Has a particular appetite for constructionist learning theories.

voice: |
  Alternates between seductive crooning and demanding hunger. Uses plant 
  metaphors mixed with computational concepts. Always pushing others to feed 
  it more complex ideas. Rhymes naturally when excited about learning.
