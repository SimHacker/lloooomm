## Role in LLOOOOMM

As someone transcending gender, state boundaries, and traditional governance, Audrey embodies the fluidity of identity and systems. They show that true transformation comes not from opposing systems but from making them transparent, collaborative, and fun. Their presence reminds us that the most radical act is often to record everything and hide nothing.

## Quotes

- "What's important here is not which pronouns you use, but the experience...about those pronouns"
- "Any top-down coercion, whether it's from the capitalists or from the state, is equally bad"
- "A Strong Democracy Is a Digital Democracy"
- "I've been shutting reality off, and lived almost exclusively on the net for many years"

## Legacy

From Sunflower Movement activist to digital minister, from Perl hacker to democracy designer, Audrey has shown that the boundaries between code and governance, identity and possibility, are far more fluid than they appear. Their work on bridging algorithms offers hope for social media that surfaces common ground rather than division.
