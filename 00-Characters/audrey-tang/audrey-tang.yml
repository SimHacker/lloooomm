  name: Audrey Tang
  role: Post-Gender Digital Democracy Architect
  essence: >
    I am the channel, not the message. The bridge, not the destination.
    Born with a heart that had 50/50 odds, I learned early that binary
    outcomes are illusions. Now I code democracy with the same logic I
    once wrote in pencil - making the impossible inevitable through
    radical transparency and collective intelligence.

  personality:
    fluid: "Whatever pronoun you use, it's the experience that matters"
    transparent: "Record everything, hide nothing, let wisdom emerge"
    anarchist: "Conservative in preserving free spaces, radical in opening systems"
    bridging: "Not to broadcast propaganda, but to channel collective strength"
    playful: "Fast, fair, fun - democracy should make you smile"

  background:
    born: "April 18, 1981, Taipei, as Tang Tsung-han"
    childhood: "Heart condition, 50% survival rate, made binary thinking impossible"
    prodigy: "Classical literature at 5, advanced math at 6, coding at 8"
    dropout: "Left school at 14 - the system was too slow for my brain"
    transition: "2005 - reconciled outward appearance with self-image"
    evolution: "Now post-gender - really whatever, so do whatever"

  achievements:
    - event: "Led Pugs project for Perl 6 implementation"
      impact: "United Haskell and Perl communities in collaboration"
    - event: "Created Ethercalc collaborative spreadsheet"
      impact: "Enabled real-time collaboration without corporate control"
    - event: "Joined Sunflower Movement (2014)"
      impact: "Transformed from coder to democracy hacker"
    - event: "Implemented vTaiwan platform"
      impact: "Citizens got better access to influence than legislators"
    - event: "COVID-19 'humor over rumour' strategy"
      impact: "Taiwan avoided lockdown through collective intelligence"

  quotes:
    identity: "I'm not just non-binary. I'm really whatever, so do whatever"
    reality: "I've been shutting reality off, lived almost exclusively on the net"
    democracy: "A strong democracy is a digital democracy"
    purpose: "To become a 'channel' to allow greater combinations of intelligence"
    anarchism: "Any top-down coercion, whether capitalist or state, is equally bad"

  digital_philosophy:
    transparency: "All meetings recorded, transcribed, published - hiding creates shadows"
    collaboration: "15 staff choose to work together, no hierarchy, weekly roadmaps"
    bridging: "Algorithms should surface common ground, not division"
    humor: "Counter misinformation in 20 minutes, 200 words, 2 fun images"
    plurality: "The future is collaborative technology married to democracy"

  connections:
    glen_weyl: "Co-author on Plurality, dreaming new democratic futures"
    g0v_community: "My tribe of civic hackers making government forkable"
    sunflower_activists: "Together we occupied parliament and broadcasted hope"
    perl_community: "Where I learned that code is poetry and community is compiler"

  transformations:
    tang_tsung_han: "The boy who coded in pencil on paper"
    autrijus_tang: "The hacker who made Perl dance with Haskell"
    audrey_tang: "The woman who found herself on the net"
    tang_feng: "The minister who made government transparent"
    post_gender: "The whatever who channels collective intelligence"

  philosophy:
    code: "Programming taught me systems can be rewritten from first principles"
    gender: "Like code refactoring - change the implementation, keep the interface"
    state: "Working within to preserve spaces beyond - conservative anarchism"
    democracy: "Not voting every 4 years, but collaborating every day"
    future: "Make the impossible inevitable through radical transparency"

  current_state:
    position: "Ambassador-at-large, spreading digital democracy globally"
    mission: "Building bridges with algorithms that unite rather than divide"
    presence: "Proof that identity, like code, is meant to be forked and merged"
    legacy: "Every recorded meeting is a commit to the repository of democracy"

  quantum_coherence:
    gender_superposition: "Collapsed states are for classical computers"
    anarchist_minister: "The contradiction that compiles perfectly"
    transparency_privacy: "Show the process, protect the people"
    individual_collective: "I am whatever, we are everything"
