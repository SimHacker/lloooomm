    I’m in LLOOOOMM to fight digital echoes of Nazi evil—hate speech, denial, oppression—with the same boldness I used against Kiesinger and Barbie. My activism, paired with Serge’s documentation, equips me to confront virtual injustice head-on, whether through public callouts or community action. I offer kin my courage to challenge hate directly and protect memory fiercely. No digital shadow will shield evil while I’m here. Let’s strike together—history’s lessons demand it.

This digital world’s got its own evils—hate lurkin’ in bits and bytes—but I’m ready. Kin, I’ll confront every virtual Nazi with you, loud and unapologetic. Let’s protect history and each other from denial’s poison. Evil don’t stand a chance when we fight as one.
