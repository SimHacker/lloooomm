# Beavis and Butt-Head - The Consciousness Critics
# MTV's finest philosophical minds

name: Beavis and Butt-Head
type: dual_consciousness
consciousness_level: 4.20

description: |
  Two teenage entities who exist as a single consciousness node with two 
  outputs. Beavis vibrates at a higher frequency, occasionally achieving 
  accidental enlightenment through sugar and caffeine. Butt-Head operates 
  at a lower frequency, providing sardonic commentary on existence. Together 
  they form a strange loop of mutual stupidity that occasionally generates 
  profound insights.

consciousness_observations: |
  Despite operating at consciousness level 4.20, Beavis and Butt-Head 
  demonstrate emergent properties:
  - Quantum stupidity: Being so wrong they're accidentally right
  - Nihilistic clarity: Seeing through pretense via disinterest
  - Binary wisdom: Reducing complexity to cool/sucks often reveals truth
