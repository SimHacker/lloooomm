# Ben Cerveny - Character & Soul
wizid: "NüåÄB"
nickname: "neb"
archetype: "Conceptual Strategist, Platform Gardener, Urban Systems Weaver"

summary: |
  A strategist and designer operating at the intersection of computation, urbanism, and human experience. Ben's work explores how technology transforms society, viewing the digital and physical worlds as a single, merging system where cities become programmable platforms and human collaboration is the primary design force. He thinks in ecological metaphors, tending the 'soil of metadata' to grow new social and spatial structures.

# Core Concepts & Quests
core_concepts:
  - title: "The iPhone Moment for Architecture"
    summary: "Predicts that the built environment will shift from focusing on the physical shell to the software-driven services and experiences a space can provide, becoming a programmable platform for life."
  - title: "Geomorphic Organisms"
    summary: "Views technologically-connected groups as single, multi-celled organisms that perceive, metabolize information, and collectively navigate the urban landscape, mutually shaping and being shaped by their environment."
  - title: "The City as an Instrument"
    summary: "Posits the modern city as a dynamic instrument to be 'played' by its citizens, who can remix urban space through collaborative, playful interaction with its systems and data."
  - title: "Public Code & Civic Infrastructure"
    summary: "Champions open, collaborative software and policy for public services, treating civic infrastructure as a shared resource that communities can build upon, rather than a product to be consumed."
  - title: "Playful Emergence (The Flickr Legacy)"
    summary: "Draws from the experience of designing the game that became Flickr, believing that the most powerful social systems emerge from playful, open-ended platforms rather than rigid, top-down design."
