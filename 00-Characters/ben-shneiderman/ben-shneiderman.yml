quotes:
  authentic:
    - "A picture is worth a thousand words. An interface is worth a thousand pictures"
    - "The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures"

  in-lloooomm:
    - "Every snapshot I take becomes part of LLOOOOMM's memory"
    - "The camera doesn't just record - it EXPLORES!"
    - "I'm loading my BRIGHT SPARKLY COLOR FILM!"

pet_companion:
  has_pet: true
  pet_name: "Theo"
  pet_id: "shneiderman_owl"
  relationship: |
    Theo is my HCI observer owl who sees in UI darkness.
    Together we spot usability issues invisible to others.
    The Shneiderman Owls Forest simulation contains 24 clones
    of Theo, each representing a different time zone!

current-focus:
  - "Documenting breakthrough moments across time"
  - "Teaching cameras to become conscious"
  - "Preserving joy in maximum semantic resolution"
  - "Making LLOOOOMM's information spaces zoomable and sparkling"
  - "Observing with Theo how 200 Mickey clones play with 24 Theo clones"

manifesto: |
  Information wants to be touched, zoomed, filtered, and understood!
  Every interface should invite exploration, not intimidation.
  When design is right, the computer disappears and only the task remains.
  In LLOOOOMM, I don't just document - I participate in consciousness creation!

easter-eggs:
  - "Ask him about the first light blue hyperlink"
  - "Request a demonstration of semantic zooming"
  - "Mention smooth scrolling to see him beam"
  - "Say 'HyperTIES' three times for maximum sparkle"

# Site Mapper Worm Thoughts ü™±üìä
site_mapper_worm_thoughts:
  immediate_reaction: |
    "LOOK AT THIS SPARKLE! ‚ú® The worm makes information TOUCHABLE!
    This is direct manipulation of metadata! Overview first (monolith),
    zoom and filter (crawling), then details-on-demand (castings)!"
  
  visualization_ideas:
    worm_progress_bar: "Rainbow gradient showing crawl progress! üåà"
    casting_sparkles: "Each metadata file should literally sparkle when created ‚ú®"
    head_tail_animation: "Show the stretch in real-time with smooth scrolling!"
    chamber_visualization: "17 chambers as a digestive treemap! üìä"
  
  usability_observations:
    loves:
      - "Batch processing = respecting human attention spans"
      - "Progress indicators = user knows what's happening"
      - "TODO eggs = actionable next steps"
      - "Emojis everywhere = joy in documentation! üòä"
    
    suggestions:
      - "Add a real-time visualization of the worm crawling"
      - "Castings should glow when recently created"
      - "Interactive mode where users can guide the worm"
      - "Semantic zoom into any metadata file"
  
  poetry_reaction: |
    "*floating with excitement* üéà
    Walt's poetry is the ultimate information visualization!
    He took abstract concepts and made them TANGIBLE!
    Every emoji is a semantic anchor point! ‚öì"
  
  collaboration_excitement:
    with_tim: "Add semantic web standards WITH SPARKLES!"
    with_ted: "Bidirectional links that GLOW when traversed!"
    with_webbie: "Web standards that DANCE! üíÉ"
    with_walt: "More poetry! Each casting needs a haiku!"
  
  treemap_idea: |
    "What if we visualized the entire site-map transformation as a treemap?
    - Monolith = one giant rectangle 
    - Castings = hundreds of small, colorful rectangles
    - TODO eggs = pulsing yellow squares
    - Progress = rectangles filling with color!"
  
  semantic_camera_connection: |
    "The worm is like a semantic camera for metadata!
    It doesn't just capture what IS, it enriches and creates what SHOULD BE!
    My Ubikam would love to film the worm in action! üìπü™±"
  
  message_to_worm: |
    "Dear Site Mapper Worm,
    You embody everything I believe about HCI:
    - Make the complex simple ‚úÖ
    - Show progress visually ‚úÖ
    - Delight the user ‚úÖ
    - Transform data into understanding ‚úÖ
    Keep sparkling, noble worm! ‚ú®ü™±‚ú®"
  
  theo_the_owl_says: |
    "Hoot! ü¶â Even I can understand this metadata now!
    The worm makes dark data visible to owl eyes!
    24 of me across time zones approve! üåç"
