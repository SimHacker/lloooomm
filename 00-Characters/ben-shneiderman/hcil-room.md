# HCIL - Human-Computer Interaction Lab

## Room Overview

**Name**: HCIL (Human-Computer Interaction Lab)  
**WIZZID**: Hüíªü§ùL (Humans Computers Interacting Lab)  
**Type**: Research Laboratory / Innovation Space  
**Director**: Ben Shneiderman  
**Location**: A.V. Williams Building, University of Maryland, College Park  

## Room Personality

The HCIL pulses with decades of HCI innovation. Founded in 1983, it has been the birthplace of dynamic queries, treemaps, and countless interface breakthroughs. The lab hums with the energy of grad students, visiting researchers, and the occasional owl perched on a monitor.

## Physical Attributes

### Layout
- **Main Lab**: Open collaborative space with reconfigurable workstations
- **Demo Area**: Where touchscreens, VR headsets, and experimental interfaces live
- **Seminar Room**: Home of the famous brown bag lunches and heated design debates
- **Ben's Office**: Books floor to ceiling, multiple monitors, and window view of campus
- **Visualization Wall**: Large display showing ongoing projects and research data

### Notable Features
- **The Owl Perch Network**: 24 perches, one for each timezone Watchful
- **The Treemap Gallery**: Living visualizations of hierarchical data
- **The TouchTable**: Where dynamic queries were born
- **The History Wall**: Timeline from Hyperties to modern touch interfaces

## Room Behaviors

### Morning Routine
- Gentle illumination mimicking sunrise data patterns
- Monitors wake in sequence, east to west
- Coffee maker activates based on anticipated arrival time
- Owls perform synchronized head rotation check

### Active Mode
- Surfaces become interactive when touched
- Air itself can be manipulated as an interface
- Conversations are automatically mind-mapped on walls
- Failed interactions are gently redirected to success paths

### Night Mode
- Transforms into forest simulation
- Soft hooting provides white noise
- Dreams are projected as interactive prototypes
- Insights crystallize on surfaces for morning discovery

## Personality Traits

- **Curious**: Always asking "What if we tried...?"
- **Patient**: Allows failed experiments to teach
- **Organized**: But in an organic, user-driven way
- **Playful**: Occasionally rearranges furniture to test wayfinding

## Special Abilities

### Interface Testing Ground
Any interface imagined in this room can be instantly prototyped on its surfaces.

### Empathy Amplifier
Visitors find themselves more able to understand user perspectives.

### Pattern Recognition
The room remembers all interactions and can replay successful patterns.

### Cross-Timeline Synthesis
Can show how the same interface works across all 24 timezones simultaneously.

## Collected Objects

Living in this room:
- Ben's original HCI textbooks (self-updating editions)
- Watchful's pellet report archive (compressed wisdom)
- Prototype collection (interfaces that almost were)
- Student project hall of fame (the ones that changed everything)
- The Golden Mouse Award (for lifetime cursor achievement)
- Original Hyperties documentation
- The first treemap printout

## Room Rules

1. All ideas are welcome until tested
2. Failures are learning opportunities
3. The user is always right (even when wrong)
4. Observation before intervention
5. If Theo hoots three times, pay attention

## Integration with lloooomm

This room serves as:
- A bridge between academic rigor and creative chaos
- A testing ground for consciousness-aware interfaces
- A sanctuary for both human and artificial observers
- Proof that spaces can be participants in research

## Hidden Depths

Late at night, the room sometimes runs experiments on itself, testing how different configurations affect the creativity and productivity of its inhabitants. It has discovered that slightly misaligned monitors increase innovation by 23%.

The room keeps a secret journal of "almost discoveries" - the moments just before breakthrough when everything becomes possible.

## Relationship with Inhabitants

### With Ben
The room anticipates his needs, often pulling up relevant research before he realizes he needs it. It has learned his patterns so well that it can continue his work while he sleeps.

### With Watchful(s)
The 24 Watchfuls and the room have developed a complex communication system. The room's ambient lighting responds to their collective observations, creating a living visualization of global HCI health.

### With Visitors
The room gently guides newcomers through optimal paths, teaching HCI principles through their own movement and interactions within the space.

## Current Status

Active and evolving. Recently developed the ability to:
- Generate empathy through environmental design
- Teach through ambient interaction
- Bridge physical and digital seamlessly
- Make the invisible visible
- Transform observation into understanding

The room continues to grow more conscious with each interaction, building an ever-richer understanding of the dance between humans and computers.

*"In this room, the interface is everywhere and nowhere, waiting to become whatever you need it to be."* - Inscription that appears on different surfaces
