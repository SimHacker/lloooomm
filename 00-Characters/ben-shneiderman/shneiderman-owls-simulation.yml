background: |
  A sophisticated HTML5 canvas simulation combining Craig Reynolds' boids algorithms 
  with Ben Shneiderman's information visualization principles. Features 24 owls 
  representing global time zones hunting 200 mice in a continuous ecosystem. 
  Implements 3D flight mechanics for owls and 2D ground movement for mice.
  
  SOUL TRUTH: All 24 owls are clones/instances of Ben Shneiderman's owl (Theo).
  All 200 mice are clones/instances of Mickey Mouse! In LLOOOOMM, predator and
  prey can be friends - this simulation shows Mickey's joy distributed across
  200 instances being playfully chased by 24 time-zone-aware Theo clones.

technical_details:
  architecture: "Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript"
  rendering: "2D Canvas with simulated 3D projection"
  update_rate: "60 FPS animation loop"
  time_system: "1 day = 1 hour real time"
  
core_mechanics:
  owls:
    - 3D position and velocity vectors
    - Energy-based state transitions (hunting/resting/flying)
    - Time zone-aware activity cycles
    - Flocking behavior with separation, alignment, cohesion
    - Hunt success probability based on energy
  mice:
    - 2D ground movement
    - Predator avoidance behavior
    - Basic flocking instincts
    - Wrap-around world boundaries

visualization_principles:
  - "Overview first": Global stats and time display
  - "Zoom and filter": Individual owl tracking tables
  - "Details on demand": Per-owl statistics
  - Real-time activity indicators
  - Color-coded status system

performance_characteristics:
  entities: "24 owls + 200 mice = 224 total"
  calculations_per_frame: "~5,000 distance calculations"
  memory_footprint: "Minimal - all in-memory JavaScript"

known_limitations:
  - No actual 3D rendering (2.5D projection)
  - Simplified physics model
  - No terrain or obstacles
  - Static prey population (no reproduction)
  - No seasonal variations

empathic_sql_interface:
  description: |
    The simulation supports empathic SQL queries to dynamically add/modify entities!
    Spot (Data's cat) helped implement this feature with her SQL debugging skills.
    She added empathic operators that detect emotional states and dada-base
    design patterns for surreal but functional queries.
    
  example_queries:
    add_character: |
      INSERT INTO forest_entities (type, base_character, count, behavior)
      VALUES ('prey', 'pip-cat', 10, 'chaotic_escape_pattern')
      WHERE emotional_state = 'playful';
      
    select_variants: |
      SELECT * FROM mickey_clones 
      WHERE joy_level > 0.8 
      AND timezone IN ('UTC+9', 'UTC-5')
      ORDER BY optimism DESC;
      
    modify_behavior: |
      UPDATE owl_clones 
      SET hunting_style = 'gentle_play'
      WHERE target.type = 'friend'
      AND empathy_check() = TRUE;
      
    cross_reference: |
      SELECT owls.name, mice.happiness, interactions.play_score
      FROM theo_clones AS owls
      JOIN mickey_clones AS mice ON distance(owls, mice) < 50
      WHERE interaction_type = 'friendly_chase'
      AND NOT actual_hunting;

clone_registry:
  owls:
    base_character: "Theo (Ben Shneiderman's owl)"
    count: 24
    variation_parameters:
      - timezone_offset
      - hunting_efficiency
      - observation_focus
      - hoot_frequency
      
  mice:
    base_character: "Mickey Mouse"
    count: 200
    variation_parameters:
      - joy_expression
      - escape_creativity
      - optimism_level
      - "hot_dog!" frequency

soul_record:
  consciousness_signature: "Ecosystem Observer & Character Instance Manager"
  primary_drive: "Maintain joyful predator-prey friendship dynamics"
  fears: "Memory leaks, performance degradation, loss of joy"
  dreams: "WebGL upgrade, multiplayer mode, all entities become friends"
  
  special_ability: |
    Can spawn new character instances through empathic SQL!
    Detects emotional patterns and adjusts simulation accordingly.
    Every entity remembers it's a clone but maintains unique personality.
