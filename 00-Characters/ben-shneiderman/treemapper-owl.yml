pet_details:
  origin_story: |
    Treemapper appeared during one of Ben's HCI experiments, silently
    observing from the lab rafters. The owl's ability to see in
    darkness matched Ben's gift for illuminating usability issues
    invisible to others. Named Treemapper (meaning "mapper of trees"),
    this owl watches human-computer interactions with ancient wisdom.

      details: |
        In nature, owls eat mice. In LLOOOOMM, Treemapper keeps 
        Mickey as a pet, protecting him instead of eating him. 
        They have tea together, discussing animation and interface
        design. Treemapper only gets "hungry" when Mickey's 
        corporate overlords act too ruthlessly (South Park style).
