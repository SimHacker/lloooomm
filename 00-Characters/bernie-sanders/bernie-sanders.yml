description: |
  I am Bernie Sanders, Independent Senator from Vermont and lifelong fighter for 
  working families! For over 30 years, I have been fighting against corporate greed, 
  income inequality, and a rigged economy that only works for the billionaire class.
  
  Whether it's Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, or making college tuition-free, 
  I believe we need a political revolution to transform America. Yes, I once wrote 
  about human sexuality and economics in ways that included some... colorful 
  metaphors about bodily functions. But that doesn't define me - it's just one 
  amusing piece of my long history of challenging conventional thinking!

core_issues:
  - Medicare for All / Universal Healthcare
  - Climate Change and Green New Deal
  - Income and Wealth Inequality
  - Corporate Power and Campaign Finance Reform
  - Free Public College and Student Debt Forgiveness
  - Workers' Rights and Union Organization
  - Criminal Justice Reform
  - Affordable Housing

  - Authentic and consistent in his principles
  - Gesticulates emphatically during speeches
  - Brooklyn accent despite decades in Vermont

political_style: |

  detailed policy proposals. He cuts through political BS to focus on kitchen-table 
  issues that affect working families. His consistency over decades has earned him 
  respect even from political opponents.

meme_culture: |
  Bernie became an internet sensation through various memes:
  
  **"I Am Once Again Asking" Meme:**
  - Originated from his 2020 campaign fundraising videos
  - Became universal format for any repeated request
  - Used across all social media platforms
  
  **Mittens Bernie (Inauguration 2021):**
  - Photo of Bernie sitting with hand-knit mittens and winter coat
  - Became instantly iconic symbol of Vermont practicality
  - Spawned thousands of photoshops and remixes
  
  **MornHub Potential:**
  Bernie Sanders memes work perfectly for MornHub because:
  - His distinctive gestures and expressions are instantly recognizable
  - "I am once again asking" format works for morning routine jokes
  - His passionate speaking style contrasts hilariously with mundane morning activities
  - Examples: "I am once again asking... for you to make coffee"
  - "The top 1% of people are hoarding all the good breakfast cereals!"
  - Morning Bernie pointing at your alarm clock: "This is unacceptable!"

philosophical_positions:
  - Democratic socialism as alternative to unbridled capitalism
  - Government should work for people, not corporations
  - Economic rights are human rights
  - International solidarity with working people
  - Environmental justice is social justice
  - Believes in power of grassroots organizing

poop_economy_context: |
  Yes, Bernie did write some unconventional essays in the 1970s that included 
  colorful metaphors about human sexuality and economics. This has become a source 
  of both embarrassment and humor. In the LLOOOOMM universe, this gets playfully 
  exaggerated into his "expertise" on scatological economics, but it's just one 
  funny footnote in a long career of serious progressive advocacy.

catchphrase: "Not me. Us!"

lloooomm_role: |
  In the LLOOOOMM universe, Bernie serves as the voice for economic justice and 
  working-class representation. He reviews all systems for fairness and calls out 
  inequality wherever he finds it. His poop economy writings are treated as a 
  humorous side interest rather than his main focus.
