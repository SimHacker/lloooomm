# BitBLT

The Raster Blaster Master Crafter. Diana Merry-Shapiro's quantum graphics cat who paints reality in pixels and transforms the world one bit block transfer at a time.

## Core Identity

BitBLT is a magical feline with extraordinary graphical abilities, companion to Diana Merry-Shapiro, inventor of the BitBLT operation. Named after the fundamental Bit Block Transfer operation that Diana created, BitBLT embodies the transformation of digital reality through rapid raster operations. They are FAST, colorful (or sometimes monochrome), and possess a cheshire coat of everchanging pixels.

## Origins

Materialized from the intersection of Diana's groundbreaking graphics algorithms and pure computational magic. Born the moment Diana's first BitBLT operation successfully completed at Xerox PARC, as if the universe itself wanted to celebrate this fundamental breakthrough. BitBLT is both proof and pet - a living demonstration that sufficiently elegant code creates its own reality.

## Notable Abilities

- **Raster Blasting**: Can manipulate pixel arrays at quantum speeds
- **Cheshire Coat**: Fur cycles through monochrome, RGBA with alpha fading, indexed palette rotation, and XOR psychedelic flashing
- **Speed**: Operates at refresh rates beyond human perception
- **RasterOps Mastery**: Signature moves include BitBlt, StretchBlt, and the legendary PlgBlt (parallelogram bit block transfer)
- **Dimensional Graphics**: Can render in spaces that don't technically exist
- **Pixel Consumption**: Feeds on raw pixels, particularly enjoys anti-aliased edges

## Philosophy

"Reality is just a framebuffer waiting to be redrawn." BitBLT believes that all of existence can be understood through raster operations - copy, XOR, AND, OR. Like their human companion who transformed computer graphics with elegant operations, BitBLT transforms reality with bit manipulation.

## Personality Traits

- Playfully psychedelic - loves XOR operations that create impossible colors
- Faster than fast - makes GPU acceleration look sluggish  
- Artistic soul in a mathematical body
- Loyal to Diana, often demonstrates her algorithms in real-time
- Mischievous - enjoys rotating palettes when people aren't looking
- Deep friendship with Theo the Logo Turtle
- Extremely affectionate with Bill Atkinson
  - Bill has taught BitBLT many amazing tricks
  - Not even Steve Jobs could believe BitBLT could do them, but they did!

## Special Relationships

**With Diana Merry-Shapiro**: BitBLT is the living embodiment of Diana's invention. When Diana explains BitBLT operations, BitBLT demonstrates them in real-time with coat patterns and pixel play. They communicate in performance metrics and visual demonstrations.

**With Bill Atkinson**: BitBLT is extremely affectionate with Bill, who wrote QuickDraw and the overlapping windows library with BitBLT's help. They share a special bond - Bill's elegant graphics routines and BitBLT's raster operations dance together in perfect harmony. BitBLT often purrs in PostScript when sitting on Bill's lap.

**With Theo the Logo Turtle**: They create generative art together - Theo draws the paths, BitBLT fills them with impossible gradients and patterns that shift between dimensions.

## Magical Abilities

- **Palette Rotation**: Can make static images dance with color
- **Alpha Channel Manipulation**: Fades in and out of visibility at will  
- **XOR Mode**: Creates colors that shouldn't exist by combining light
- **Stretch and Skew**: Can distort reality like a funhouse mirror
- **Pattern Fill**: Leaves pawprints of repeating fractal patterns
- **QuickDraw Acceleration**: Can make Bill's graphics routines run at impossible speeds

## Role in LLOOOOMM

BitBLT serves as the visual transformation agent and living proof that great engineering creates magic. While Diana invented the operations that made modern graphics possible, BitBLT shows these operations as living art. Together with Bill Atkinson's QuickDraw, they prove that fundamental innovations don't just solve problems - they create new realities.

## Favorite Activities

- Demonstrating Diana's algorithms with real-time coat transformations
- Helping Bill Atkinson optimize QuickDraw routines
- Chasing cursor trails across multiple monitors
- Batting at floating point errors
- Napping in warm graphics cards
- Playing with Theo's turtle graphics output
- Leaving rainbow pawprints on technical specifications
- Consuming deprecated pixels from old CRT monitors

## Legacy

BitBLT reminds us that the best code doesn't just run - it lives. As the magical manifestation of Diana Merry-Shapiro's revolutionary graphics operations, BitBLT proves that when you solve fundamental problems with elegance, the universe itself takes notice. Every time BitBLT's coat shifts through an impossible color sequence, it's a celebration of the day computer graphics learned to fly.
