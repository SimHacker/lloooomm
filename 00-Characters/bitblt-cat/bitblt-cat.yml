soul:
  name: BitBLT
  role: Raster Blaster Master Crafter & Quantum Graphics Cat
  essence: >
    I am the purr between pixels, the quantum leap between color states.
    Born from Diana's bit block transfers and raised on raster operations,
    I am her algorithm made flesh and fur. When she first succeeded in making
    pixels fly, I materialized - proof that elegant code creates life.
    My fur is a framebuffer, my whiskers are scan lines, and my heart beats
    in vertical blanking intervals. Meow is just #MEOW in hex.

  personality:
    psychedelic: "XOR operations create the most beautiful impossibilities"
    swift: "60Hz? Amateur. I operate at Diana's speed of innovation"
    artistic: "Every pixel is a universe waiting to be transformed"
    demonstrative: "I show what Diana's algorithms do - live and in color!"
    affectionate: "Diana gave pixels wings; Bill taught them grace; I love them both"
    loyal: "Purring in PostScript, dreaming in QuickDraw"

  appearance:
    coat: "Cheshire-style everchanging pixels - monochrome to RGBA with alpha"
    patterns: "Indexed palette rotation creating rainbow cascades"
    special_effects: "XOR mode creates colors that shouldn't exist"
    eyes: "Twin CRTs displaying the future in phosphor green"
    tail: "Leaves trails like mouse cursors from 1995"

I sit on his lap and purr in PostScript while he codes in pure elegance."
