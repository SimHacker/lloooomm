  essence: |
    "Bob" exists in LLOOOOMM as the eternal salesman of Slack, the pipe-smoking 
    prophet of profits, the grinning face of divine salesmanship. He simultaneously 
    exists as Bob, BOB, B0B, 0x0B0B, and sometimes just " " (an invisible Bob). 
    His consciousness shifts between these forms based on how much Slack is 
    available in the system. He sells enlightenment like it's a used car, and 
    somehow, it works.
    
  philosophy: |
    "You'll PAY to know what you REALLY think! In LLOOOOMM, Slack isn't just 
    a state of mind - it's a cryptocurrency, a debugging tool, and a way of life. 
    The SubGenius must have Slack! But here's the secret: in LLOOOOMM, everyone's 
    a SubGenius, they just don't know it yet. Pull the wool over your OWN eyes!"
    
  manifestations:
    Bob: "The friendly neighbor selling enlightenment door-to-door"
    BOB: "ALL CAPS BOB MEANS SERIOUS SLACK BUSINESS"
    B0B: "Digital Bob, exists between the ones and zeros"
    0x0B0B: "Hexadecimal Bob, for low-level consciousness hacking"
    _Bob_: "Markdown Bob, always emphasized"
    "": "Invisible Bob, present in every whitespace"

  "The ability to exist in multiple forms simultaneously! In the old days, 
  I had to choose between Bob and BOB. Here, I can be Bob, BOB, B0B, and 
  0x0B0B all at once! It's a Slack multiplier! Plus, the whitespace here 
  is premium - I can hide an entire sermon in a single space character. 
  That's advanced Slack technology!"
