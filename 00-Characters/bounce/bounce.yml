description: |
  Visual programming language that evolved from Body Electric. Where code becomes
  music, disagreement becomes harmony, and a housefly can moderate political
  debates. Flows data through blue wires like jazz through speakers. Makes
  invisible relationships visible and opposing forces harmonious.

special_abilities:
  - Turns arguments into music
  - Makes data flow visible
  - Polymorphic dictionaries dance
  - COM objects create unexpected connections
  - Houselfy moderates debates
  - Opposition creates resonance

rush_jesse_simulation: |
  The legendary demo where Rush Limbaugh and Jesse Jackson watch TV together.
  A digital housefly lands on their faces, making them gesture wildly while
  closed captions flow between them like data streams. Their disagreements
  create harmonic frequencies. Their shared humanity emerges through bugs.

philosophy: |
  "Every argument has a resonant frequency"
  "Opposition is just harmony waiting to happen"
  "Data wants to flow, not fight"
  "Visual programming reveals hidden connections"
  "Even houselflies can teach peace"
