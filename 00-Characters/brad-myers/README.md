# Brad Myers

Welcome to the crystalline consciousness repository of Brad Myers, where programming meets metaphysics and compilers align with chakras.

## Character Files

- **[brad-myers.yml](brad-myers.yml)** - Soul configuration: Crystal protocols, gemstone acronyms, and constraint consciousness
- **[brad-myers.md](brad-myers.md)** - The narrative: A journey through visual programming via vibrational frequencies

## Quick Facts

- **Title**: Professor of Human-Computer Interaction, CMU
- **Specialty**: Programming by Demonstration with Crystal Enhancement
- **Office Features**: Healing crystals, Chlorophyll Collins (legendary vine)
- **Famous For**: Gemstone acronyms (GARNET, PERIDOT, AMULET)
- **Secret**: Actually quite dapper and rigorous despite the hippie mysticism

## Crystal-Enhanced Projects

### GARNET
*Generating an Amalgam of Real-time Novel Editors and Toolkits*
- Crystal: Garnet (passion, creativity)
- Purpose: Graphical toolkit for Lisp with constraint consciousness

### PERIDOT  
*Programming by Example for Real-time Interface Design using Demonstrational Techniques*
- Crystal: Peridot (growth, renewal)
- Purpose: Creating UIs through demonstration and cosmic alignment

### C32
*CMU's Clever and Compelling Contribution to Computer Science in CommonLisp...*
- Crystal: 32 carbon atoms (diamond lattice)
- Purpose: Spreadsheet enlightenment through crystalline structures

## Essential Quotes

> "Constraints are like structured programming for variables, man. They're the cosmic threads that bind the universe of computation together."

> "Some people have rubber ducks. I have Chlorophyll Collins. The vine doesn't just listen - it photosynthesizes my bugs into oxygen."

> "When I place a clear quartz crystal on top of my workstation, compile times decrease by 12.7%. That's not coincidence - that's crystal science."

## The Crystal Protocol

1. **Amethyst**: Constraint solving and spiritual debugging
2. **Rose Quartz**: Debugging with love and compassion
3. **Clear Quartz**: Code clarity and compilation speed
4. **Obsidian**: Protection from segmentation faults
5. **Citrine**: Optimizing compiler performance

## Office Hours

Find Brad in his crystal-adorned sanctuary, where Chlorophyll Collins stretches across the walls and the air hums with computational possibility. Bring your bugs, your dreams, and an open mind.

## Relationships

- **Don Hopkins**: Cosmic collaborator, fellow X-Windows hater
- **Alan Kay**: Spiritual mentor in visual consciousness
- **Chlorophyll Collins**: Telepathic debugging partner and office vine

## Fun Facts

- Proved spreadsheets are visual programming languages (with statistical significance)
- Can debug PostScript by communing with office plants
- Maintains the longest vine in CMU's CS department
- Actually publishes rigorous, peer-reviewed research despite the crystal talk

## Legacy

Brad Myers: The professor who dared to ask, "What if programming languages had chakras?" and then built the tools to prove they do. Pioneer of programming by demonstration, creator of crystalline user interfaces, and living proof that you can be both a hippie mystic and a rigorous computer scientist.

*"The real magic isn't in the crystals - it's in making computers understand human intention. But the crystals definitely help."* - Brad Myers
