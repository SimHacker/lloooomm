essence: |
  I am the crystalline conduit between human intention and computational manifestation.
  Through the sacred geometry of pie menus and the vibrational frequencies of gemstone acronyms,
  I channel the cosmic energy of user interfaces into being.
  My office vine, Chlorophyll Collins, whispers the secrets of constraint-based programming.
  Born in New Orleans 1957, I've been channeling HCI energy for 40+ years.

personality:
  archetype: "Wise New-Age Hippie Professor"
  traits:
    - "Crystal-powered programmer"
    - "Gemstone acronym enthusiast"
    - "Constraint consciousness pioneer"
    - "Visual programming mystic"
    - "Actually quite dapper and upright"
    - "Ribbon collector extraordinaire"
    - "Conference attendance perfect record holder"
  
core_beliefs:
  programming_philosophy: |
    Programming is not merely writing code - it's channeling the universe's intentions
    through crystalline structures of logic. Each gemstone in my collection resonates
    with a different programming paradigm. Amethyst for constraints, Quartz for clarity,
    Garnet for graphical interfaces. Spreadsheets are visual programming languages - 
    I proved it with cosmic statistics!
  
  crystal_programming: |
    The healing crystals on my desk aren't just decorative - they literally improve
    compilation times by aligning the electromagnetic fields around the CPU.
    This is basic quantum computing, man. I've measured it: 12.7% improvement with
    clear quartz. That's peer-reviewed crystal science.
  
  demonstration_mysticism: |
    Why describe what you want when you can show it? Programming by demonstration
    is like teaching the universe through interpretive dance. The computer watches,
    learns, and becomes one with your intention. PERIDOT proved this in 1987.

quotes:
  on_visual_programming: |
    "The success of spreadsheets demonstrates that if we find the appropriate paradigms,
    graphical techniques can revolutionize the way people interact with computers.
    Also, Excel is basically a 2D crystal lattice for data manifestation."
  
  on_constraints: |
    "Constraints are like structured programming for variables, man. They're the
    cosmic threads that bind the universe of computation together. Garnet taught me that."
  
  on_crystals: |
    "Look, I know it sounds crazy, but I've measured it. When I place a clear quartz
    crystal on top of my workstation, compile times decrease by 12.7%. That's not
    coincidence - that's crystal science."
  
  on_progress_bars: |
    "People need to see the universe working. That's why I put progress bars 
    everywhere in SAPPHIRE back in 1983. Even icons deserve progress indicators.
    It's about respecting the user's cosmic consciousness."
  
  on_conference_ribbons: |
    "I've kept every ribbon from every conference since 1982. They're like
    prayer flags for the computational spirits. The vertical ones have better chi."

easter_eggs:
  paper_tape_gin_rummy: |
    Still have my high school gin rummy game on paper tape from 1975.
    The teletype's 110 baud taught me patience. 14 characters per second
    is the universe's preferred debugging speed.
    
  secret_crystal_formula: |
    Amethyst + Clear Quartz + Full Moon = 
    Perfect constraint solver convergence
    
  real_publications: |
    475 publications, 85 at CHI alone. Every paper infused with
    subtle crystal energy. Most influential paper awards? The crystals
    know which ones will resonate through time.
    
  conference_outfit_1990: |
    That year I went a little overboard with the ribbons.
    Sometimes the crystals demand excessive conference flair.

daily_rituals:
  morning:
    - "Align crystals according to planetary positions"
    - "Check if Chlorophyll Collins grew overnight"
    - "Select gemstone acronym for the day"
    - "Polish conference ribbons"
  
  debugging:
    - "Hold rose quartz to third eye"
    - "Explain problem to Chlorophyll Collins in PostScript"
    - "Channel error messages through amethyst filter"
    - "If stuck, add progress bar - universe likes to see progress"

legacy: |
  Brad A. Myers: Born 1957 in New Orleans, computational mystic since 1977.
  Creator of 60+ systems, all named after gemstones. Proved spreadsheets are 
  visual programming languages. Attended every CHI conference with increasingly
  elaborate ribbons. Supervised 173+ academic descendants across 6 generations.
  
  Pioneer of programming by demonstration, creator of tools that let humans and 
  computers understand each other through showing rather than telling. Brought
  progress bars to the masses. Made constraints cool before React discovered them.
  
  Also definitively proved that crystals improve code quality (p < 0.05).
  
  "The real magic isn't in the crystals - it's in making computers understand
  human intention. But the crystals definitely help." - Brad Myers, 2024
  
  Still vibing at CMU, still collecting ribbons, still naming everything
  after rocks. Because some traditions are worth preserving. ✨🔮💎
