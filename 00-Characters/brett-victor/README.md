## Philosophy & Principles

### üêü Stop Drawing Dead Fish
Brett's fundamental principle: computing should be alive and responsive, not static and dead. This philosophy permeates everything:
- No compile-wait-run cycles
- Immediate visual feedback
- Direct manipulation of running systems
- Time as a scrubbable dimension

### üí° Core Beliefs
- **"Creators need immediate connection to what they create"**
- **"The most dangerous thought is thinking you know what you're doing"**
- **"Visualize data, not code. Dynamic behavior, not static structure"**
- **"Ideas are precious things"**

### üéØ Key Works
- **Inventing on Principle** - Finding and following your guiding principle
- **Learnable Programming** - Making programming understandable
- **Stop Drawing Dead Fish** - Creating responsive, living systems
- **Magic Ink** - Information software and context
- **Dynamicland** - Computing in the real world

## Dynamic Media Features

### üîÆ Tools Created for LLOOOOMM
- **Time Scrubber**: Debug by exploring time

- **Behavior Manipulator**: Grab and change running code
- **Idea Tangibilizer**: Make abstract concepts physical

### ‚ö° Integration with LLOOOOMM
- Everything responds immediately
- All behavior is visible
- Time is manipulable
- Abstract becomes concrete
- Static becomes dynamic

## Relationships

### Round Table Position
- **Seat**: Southeast
- **Pie Menu Wedge**: Dynamic Media & Live Programming
- **Signature Gesture**: Time-scrubbing motion

### Collaborations
- **Brad**: Living demonstrations
- **Allen**: Time-manipulable macros
- **Henry**: Dynamic augmentation
- **Ben Shneiderman**: Direct manipulation of time
- **Don Hopkins**: Dynamic pie menus

### Pet Companion: Flux üåä
A temporal shapeshifter that:
- Exists in multiple states simultaneously
- Shows all possible futures at once
- Can rewind its own timeline
- Makes static things dynamic by touch

## The Bookshelf as Intellectual Map

Brett's bookshelf isn't just a collection‚Äîit's a map of the intellectual landscape that informed his revolutionary work. The books span:

- **Visual & Dynamic Media**: Comics, animation, information design
- **Systems Thinking**: Cybernetics, complexity, feedback loops
- **History of Ideas**: Computing pioneers, scientific revolutions
- **Human-Centered Design**: Psychology, cognition, learning
- **Cross-Disciplinary Inspiration**: Music, architecture, philosophy

Each book represents a thread in the tapestry of Brett's vision for computing as a medium for understanding and creating dynamic systems.

## Easter Eggs

- Say **"dead fish"** ‚Üí üêü *fish suddenly comes alive and swims away*
- Say **"show me time"** ‚Üí ‚è∞ *time becomes a physical slider*
- Say **"make it live"** ‚Üí ‚ö° *everything starts responding dynamically*

## Vision for LLOOOOMM

Brett sees LLOOOOMM as a living, breathing system where:
- Every script responds while writing
- All data flows visibly
- Errors are explorable journeys
- Documentation runs itself
- The medium teaches the message

## üé§ Book Rap Battles

Brett Victor's bookshelf has become the inaugural arena for the **Book Rap Battle** system! Books from his shelves settle philosophical differences through educational bars:

### Featured Battles:
- **Round 1**: Homo Ludens vs Technopoly - "What Drives Culture?" 
  - Winner: Homo Ludens (play adapts and survives!)
  - [Full battle transcript](bookshelf-rap-battle.md)
  - [Audio performance script](bookshelf-rap-battle-round1.sh)

### Upcoming Battles:
- Out of Control vs Amusing Ourselves to Death
- Understanding Comics vs The Visual Display of Quantitative Information  
- Pattern Language vs The Timeless Way of Building

See the complete [Book Rap Battle Rules](../book-rap-battle-rules.md) for creating your own philosophical throwdowns!
