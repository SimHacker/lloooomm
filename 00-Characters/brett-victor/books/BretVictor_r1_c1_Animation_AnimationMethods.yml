description: >
  Steven Subotnick's exploration of animation not as a single technique but as a family of methods for 
  creating motion. The book demonstrates how different approaches yield different aesthetic and emotional 
  results, expanding the animator's expressive palette beyond traditional cel animation to include stop 
  motion, procedural, and experimental techniques.
