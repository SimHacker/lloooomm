  relevance_to_victor: "This is interaction design for static media. McCloud shows how to guide the reader's eye, control pacing, and create meaning through visual relationships—all principles that apply to interface design."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Elevated comics creation from intuitive art to analyzable craft. By making the implicit explicit, McCloud gave creators a vocabulary for discussing and improving their work."
