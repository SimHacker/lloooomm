title: "The Comics of Chris Ware: Drawing Is a Way of Thinking"
description: >
  An academic examination of Chris Ware's innovative work exploring how his formal experiments expand 
  the possibilities of visual narrative. This analysis reveals Ware's comics as dynamic systems—diagrams 
  that tell stories and narratives that work like machines, legitimizing comics as serious academic study.
