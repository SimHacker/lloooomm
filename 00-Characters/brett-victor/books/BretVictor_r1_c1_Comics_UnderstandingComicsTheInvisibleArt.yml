description: >
  Scott McCloud's seminal work uses the comic book medium itself to explore the definition, history, 
  vocabulary, and methods of comics. This groundbreaking book reveals how sequences of images create 
  meaning and gave comics a vocabulary to discuss itself as an art form. It's essential reading for 
  understanding visual communication and sequential storytelling.
