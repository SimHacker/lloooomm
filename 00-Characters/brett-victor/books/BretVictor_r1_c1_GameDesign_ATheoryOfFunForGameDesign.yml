title: "A Theory of Fun for Game Design"
description: >
  Raph Koster's exploration of the cognitive and psychological reasons why we find games fun argues 
  that fun is the act of learning and mastering new patterns. This work connects the primordial human 
  drive for play with the cognitive act of learning, showing that fun isn't frivolous but the brain's 
  reward for mastering reality.
