title: "How to Do Things with Videogames"
description: >
  Ian Bogost's argument for the cultural and persuasive power of video games reveals games as a medium 
  as flexible as language itself. Just as we can 'do things with words,' Bogost shows we can use games 
  to persuade, express, explore, and transform culture through procedural rhetoric and interactive systems 
  that demonstrate ideas through their rules and behaviors.

  cosmic_significance: "Bogost reveals videogames as a medium as flexible as language itself. Just as we can 'do things with words,' we can do things with games—persuade, express, explore, and transform culture."
  relevance_to_victor: "Games are interactive systems that teach through experience—exactly what Victor advocates for all software. Bogost's 'procedural rhetoric' is a theory of how interactive systems communicate ideas through their rules and behaviors."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Elevates games from entertainment to a legitimate cultural form capable of addressing any topic. Shows that interactivity itself is a language for expressing ideas about how systems work."
