title: "Introduction to Three-Dimensional Design"
description: >
  Kimberly Elam's work bridges 2D design thinking with 3D spatial reasoning, showing how design 
  principles translate across dimensions. This systematic approach makes visible the invisible 
  structures that govern successful three-dimensional composition, demonstrating that spatial 
  thinking can be taught and learned like any design skill.

  cosmic_significance: "Bridges 2D design thinking with 3D spatial reasoning, showing how principles translate across dimensions. Makes visible the invisible structures that govern successful three-dimensional composition."
  relevance_to_victor: "The transition from 2D to 3D thinking parallels the transition from static to dynamic media that Victor advocates. Both involve adding dimensions of possibility while maintaining clarity of communication."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "From 3D design as sculpture or architecture to 3D design as systematic discipline with transferable principles. Shows that spatial thinking can be taught and learned like any design skill."
