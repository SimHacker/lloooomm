  cosmic_significance: "The manifesto that declared computers were for people, not just for corporations and governments. A call for a digital renaissance and the direct inspiration for the first Apple Macintosh team."
  relevance_to_victor: "Nelson's visionary, almost utopian, view of what computing could be—a medium for thought and connection rather than just calculation—is a direct intellectual ancestor of Victor's work. The call to 'THINK HYPERTEXT' is a call to create new media."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "It framed computer access as a political and creative act, inspiring a generation of hackers and personal computer pioneers. It was the bible of the early PC revolution."
