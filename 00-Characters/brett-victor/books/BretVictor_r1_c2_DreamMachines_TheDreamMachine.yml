description: >
  A sprawling history of the birth of personal computing, centered on the life and work of J.C.R. Licklider and the 
  community of researchers at ARPA who laid the groundwork for the internet and interactive computing. Waldrop tells 
  the story of how the vision of human-computer symbiosis became reality through the collaborative efforts of 
  visionaries like Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Bob Taylor, and Alan Kay at institutions like ARPA, Xerox PARC, and SRI.
