  cosmic_significance: "The book that recognized stories aren't trapped in their media but flow between them, each medium offering unique ways to think and feel narrative."
  relevance_to_victor: "Directly relevant to Victor's vision of dynamic media. Just as Victor shows how different representations enable different thoughts, Ryan shows how different media enable different narratives. Both are about the dance between form and meaning."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Established transmedia narratology as a field, showing that narrative isn't bound to text but is a cognitive construct that can be activated by various sign systems."
