  cosmic_significance: "The book that revealed writing as humanity's first mind-altering technology. Before writing, thought was ephemeral, contextual, alive. After writing, thought became fixed, abstract, analyzable. It's the story of how we learned to think about thinking."
  relevance_to_victor: "Ong's work is foundational to Victor's project. If writing transformed consciousness once, dynamic media can do it again. Victor builds on Ong's insight that tools shape thought, creating new tools for new kinds of thinking."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Established that 'literacy' isn't just a skill but a cognitive revolution. Influenced fields from anthropology to interface design by showing that communication technologies are technologies of consciousness."
