  cosmic_significance: "The book that revealed media aren't neutral pipes but active forces that reshape civilizations. Stone tablets create empires of time; paper creates empires of space."
  relevance_to_victor: "Innis's insight that media have biases directly informs Victor's work. If print biases us toward linear thinking, what biases do our current tools have? Victor designs dynamic media to overcome these limitations."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Founded the Toronto School of communication theory and influenced McLuhan. Showed that the medium shapes not just the message but the entire structure of society."
