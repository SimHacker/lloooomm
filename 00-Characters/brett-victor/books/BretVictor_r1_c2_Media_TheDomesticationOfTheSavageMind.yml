title: "The Domestication of the Savage Mind"
description: "A revolutionary work that challenges the dichotomy between 'primitive' and 'advanced' thought, arguing that differences in mentalities are better explained by changes in communication technologies, particularly writing. Goody shows how literacy transforms not just what we think, but how we think."

  cosmic_significance: "The book that dismantled the myth of the 'savage mind' by showing that cognitive differences aren't about intelligence but about toolsâ€”specifically, whether a culture has writing."
  relevance_to_victor: "Goody's insight that writing changes cognition directly supports Victor's work. If writing can transform thought, what can dynamic, interactive, visual programming do? Victor extends Goody's thesis into the digital age."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Revolutionized anthropology by showing that 'primitive' vs 'civilized' is really about 'oral' vs 'literate'. Influenced how we understand the relationship between tools and thought."
