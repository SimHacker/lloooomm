  cosmic_significance: "This traces the genealogy of an idea that changed the world. Bush's memex vision—external memory that mirrors how we think—became hypertext, the web, and beyond."
  relevance_to_victor: "Bush is the patron saint of tools for thought. His vision of trails through information space directly inspired both hypertext and Victor's explorable explanations."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Connected the dots between Bush's 1945 vision and the digital revolution, showing how one essay sparked decades of innovation."
