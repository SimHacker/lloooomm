  cosmic_significance: "Written when the web was barely born, this book asked the right questions: What happens to knowledge when books become bits? What is a library when everything is everywhere? It's about the phase transition of human memory from atoms to electrons."
  relevance_to_victor: "Libraries are humanity's external memory, and this book explores their digital metamorphosis. Victor's dynamic documents are part of this transformationâ€”not just digitizing books but reimagining what a 'book' can be when freed from paper."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Anticipated many current debates about digital preservation, access, authority, and the future of reading. Helped librarians and scholars think beyond 'books on screens' to new forms of knowledge organization."
