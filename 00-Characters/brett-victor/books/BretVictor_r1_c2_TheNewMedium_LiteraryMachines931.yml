  cosmic_significance: "The book that imagined the true hypertext universe—not the broken one-way links we got, but a living tissue of connections where nothing breaks and everything is traceable to its source."
  relevance_to_victor: "Nelson's Xanadu is to hypertext what Victor's dynamic medium is to computation: the fuller vision that got simplified away. Both share the dream of a medium that preserves context, connection, and malleability."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Defined what hypertext could be if we hadn't settled for less. Its concepts of transclusion and parallel documents directly influence modern thinking about digital literature."
