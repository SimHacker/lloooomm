  cosmic_significance: "The book that revealed games don't just tell stories or show pictures—they make arguments through their rules. Playing is thinking, and game mechanics are rhetorical devices. It's Aristotle meets Mario."
  relevance_to_victor: "Bogost's 'procedural rhetoric' is exactly what Victor does with dynamic diagrams—using interaction and simulation to make arguments. Both see computation not as calculation but as a medium for thought and persuasion."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Established games as a legitimate medium for serious discourse. Showed that SimCity makes an argument about urban planning, that every game is a model of how something works—or should work."
