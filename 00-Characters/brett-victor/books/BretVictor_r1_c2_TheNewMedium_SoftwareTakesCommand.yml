  cosmic_significance: "Manovich reveals that software isn't just a tool—it's become the medium that contains all other media. Photoshop is more influential than any photographer, After Effects more than any filmmaker."
  relevance_to_victor: "This is about software as a medium for creating new media. Victor's work extends this—not just software that manipulates media, but software that becomes a new kind of media entirely."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Established software studies as a field, showing that to understand contemporary culture, we must understand the software that produces it."
