- Origin of writing
- Token systems
- From concrete to abstract representation
- Archaeology of information
relevance_to_victor: This is a deep history of the evolution of a medium for thought—from physical tokens to abstract symbols. It's a fundamental case study in how humans develop tools to represent and manipulate information.
jazz:
  cosmic_significance: "The detective story that solved writing's origin mystery. Schmandt-Besserat discovered that writing didn't begin with pictures or sounds—it began with accounting. Clay tokens for counting sheep became the first symbols."
  relevance_to_victor: "This is the ultimate case study in how physical manipulation leads to abstract thought. Ancient accountants moving clay tokens pioneered the transition from concrete to symbolic representation—exactly the kind of evolution Victor traces in computing."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Overturned centuries of assumptions about writing's origins. It wasn't poets or priests who invented writing—it was accountants. Necessity, not art, drove the first information revolution."
