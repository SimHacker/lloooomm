relevance_to_victor: 'Directly addresses one of Victor''s core concerns: how the notation and representation we use for ideas fundamentally shapes our ability to think those ideas. This book is a history of the ''user interface'' for mathematics.'
jazz:
  cosmic_significance: "The biography of humanity's most powerful invention: symbols that think. Mazur shows how each new notation—from Hindu-Arabic numerals to Leibniz's dx—didn't just record thought but enabled new kinds of thinking."
  relevance_to_victor: "This is Victor's core thesis made historical: notation is a technology of thought. The book proves that better representations literally create new possibilities for human reasoning, just as Victor advocates for computing."
  paradigm_shift_potential: "Reveals that mathematical progress often waited centuries for the right notation. Calculus was impossible without proper symbols. What future mathematics awaits better representations?"
