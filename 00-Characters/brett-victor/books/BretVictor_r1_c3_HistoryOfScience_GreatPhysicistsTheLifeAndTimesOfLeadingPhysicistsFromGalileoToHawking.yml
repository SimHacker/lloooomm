title: 'Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking'
description: A masterful collection of thirty biographical portraits spanning physics from Galileo to Hawking. Cropper groups the physicists by discipline—mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and more—showing how ideas evolved through human stories. Each portrait captures both the person and their physics, with just enough equations to understand the real work.

  cosmic_significance: The book that shows physics as a deeply human endeavor—full of feuds, friendships, obsessions, and breakthroughs—proving that even the most abstract equations emerge from very real lives.
  relevance_to_victor: 'Cropper''s approach aligns with Victor''s philosophy: physics concepts are best understood through their historical development and human context. The book shows how notation, tools, and ways of thinking evolved together.'
  paradigm_shift_potential: Demonstrates that scientific revolutions aren't just about ideas but about the peculiar, passionate individuals who couldn't let go of a problem until they solved it.
