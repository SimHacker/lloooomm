title: 'Laser: The Inventor, the Nobel Laureate, and the Thirty-Year Patent War'
description: The gripping true story of Gordon Gould's thirty-year battle to win recognition—and millions in royalties—for inventing the laser. In 1957, Gould wrote down his revolutionary idea and had it notarized at a candy store, but watched as others profited from his invention while he fought the Patent Office and scientific establishment.

  cosmic_significance: 'The ultimate cautionary tale about intellectual property: how a graduate student''s three-day fever dream to invent the laser turned into a thirty-year legal nightmare that reshaped patent law.'
  relevance_to_victor: A perfect example of how tools that change the world often emerge from outsiders who see differently. Gould, like Victor, understood that new media (in this case, coherent light) could transform how we interact with reality.
  paradigm_shift_potential: Shows how the most transformative inventions often face the fiercest resistance from established authorities—and how persistence in defending one's vision can eventually prevail.
