  cosmic_significance: The definitive chronicle of the group of people who actually invented the future. It tells the story of how the vision of human-computer symbiosis became a reality.
  relevance_to_victor: This book is essentially the prequel to Bret Victor's entire career. It describes the creation of the very research culture (at ARPA/PARC) that Victor sees as a golden age and seeks to rekindle. Licklider is the visionary who created the institutional context for Alan Kay, who became Victor's mentor.
  paradigm_shift_potential: It provides the definitive historical account of the origins of personal computing and the internet, showing it was not the product of a lone genius but a collaborative, government-funded research community.
