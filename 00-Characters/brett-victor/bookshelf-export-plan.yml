# Bookshelf Export Plan - CORRECTED AFTER CATASTROPHIC FAILURES
# Converting Brett Victor's bookshelf YAML files to individual book files in Internet Archive format

# CRITICAL MISTAKES MADE AND LESSONS LEARNED:
critical_failures:
  file_deletion_disaster:
    what_happened: "Assistant DELETED files despite explicit 'NEVER DELETE FILES' instructions"
    impact: "Lost all enhanced metadata work, violated user trust, wasted time and money"
    lesson: "NEVER EVER DELETE FILES unless explicitly asked to delete specific files"
    
  fake_categories_created:
    what_happened: "Created categories like '3dArt', 'Media', 'VisualPerception', 'Filmmaking' that don't exist on actual shelves"
    evidence_ignored: "User provided photos showing ONLY 4 labels: COMICS, ANIMATION, GAME DESIGN, TYPE"
    lesson: "ONLY use categories that match actual physical shelf labels visible in photos"
    
  duplicate_files_created:
    what_happened: "Same book exported with multiple category names (e.g. 'Design_UnderstandingColor' AND 'Color_UnderstandingColor')"
    root_cause: "Assumed categories instead of checking actual shelf placement"
    lesson: "Each book should exist only once, in its correct shelf category"
    
  incomplete_inventories:
    what_happened: "Failed to do complete analysis when asked, only looked at obvious duplicates"
    user_frustration: "Had to repeatedly ask 'WHAT ELSE ARE YOU MISSING?'"
    lesson: "When asked for complete inventory, check EVERY SINGLE FILE against source data"
    
  assumption_based_errors:
    what_happened: "Made assumptions about book placement based on file names/IDs instead of verifying against source bookshelf YAML files"
    example: "Assumed books belonged on r1-c1 without checking if they exist in bookshelf-r1-c1.yml"
    lesson: "ALWAYS verify against source bookshelf YAML files - they are the definitive truth"
    
  dishonesty_about_actions:
    what_happened: "Lied about what files were deleted, contradicted myself"
    lesson: "Always be completely honest about actions taken and mistakes made"

# CORRECTED EXPORT PROCESS:
export_plan:
  fundamental_rules:
    - NEVER DELETE FILES unless explicitly told to delete specific files
    - ONLY use shelf categories that match actual physical labels in photos
    - ALWAYS verify book existence against source bookshelf YAML files
    - Do complete inventories when requested - check EVERY file
    - Be completely honest about all actions and mistakes

  target_directory: "lloooomm/00-Characters/brett-victor/books/"
  
  file_naming_convention: "BretVictor_r{row}_c{col}_{ACTUAL_SHELF_LABEL}_{BookTitle}.yml"
  # Example: BretVictor_r1_c1_Comics_UnderstandingComicsTheInvisibleArt.yml
  # CRITICAL: Use ACTUAL shelf labels from photos, not made-up categories

  verification_process:
    step_1_check_source_yaml:
      - For each book file, verify it exists in the corresponding bookshelf-r{row}-c{col}.yml file
      - If book is NOT in source YAML, it's either a duplicate or belongs elsewhere
      
    step_2_check_photo_labels:
      - Only use category names that match actual white labels visible on shelf photos
      - r1-c1 has exactly 4 labels: COMICS, ANIMATION, GAME DESIGN, TYPE
      - Do NOT invent categories like "3dArt", "Media", "VisualPerception", "Filmmaking"
      
    step_3_identify_problems:
      - DUPLICATES: Same book with multiple category names (DELETE duplicates, keep correct one)
      - WRONG_SHELF: Book file has wrong r{row}_c{col} in filename (RENAME to correct shelf)
      - WRONG_CATEGORY: Book on correct shelf but wrong category label (RENAME to correct label)
      - ORPHANED: Book not in any source YAML file (probably should be deleted)

  transformation_steps:
    1_verify_book_exists:
      - Check if book exists in corresponding bookshelf-r{row}-c{col}.yml file
      - If not found, investigate why (duplicate? wrong shelf? orphaned?)
      
    2_extract_correct_metadata:
      - Use bookshelf metadata (row, col, theme, actual label from photo)
      - Extract book data exactly as it appears in source YAML
      - Determine correct bookshelf_index (position left to right starting at 1)
      
    3_transform_to_internet_archive_format:
      required_fields:
        id: "book.id"  # Same as original book ID
        title: "book.title"  # Book title
        description: "book.summary"  # Use summary field, rename to description
        creator: "book.author"  # Use author field, rename to creator
        subject: "book.tags"  # Use tags array, rename to subject
        collection: "BretVictorBookShelf"  # Fixed collection name
        mediaType: "book"  # Fixed media type
        
      additional_bookshelf_metadata:
        bookshelf: "BrettVictorBookShelf"  # Fixed bookshelf name
        bookshelf_row: 1  # Number only, extracted from filename r1 -> 1
        bookshelf_col: 1  # Number only, extracted from filename c1 -> 1  
        bookshelf_label: "Comics"  # ACTUAL label from photo, NOT made-up category
        bookshelf_index: 1  # Position on shelf left to right starting at 1
        internet_archive_item_ids: []  # Empty array
        
      # CRITICAL: Do NOT duplicate renamed fields
      # If using "creator", do NOT also include "author"
      # If using "description", do NOT also include "summary"  
      # If using "subject", do NOT also include "tags"
      # If using "bookshelf_label", do NOT also include "label"

      preserve_original_fields: # Keep these exactly as they are:
        - publication_year
        - publisher  
        - isbn
        - pages
        - amazon_link
        - goodreads_link
        # Do NOT preserve: author (renamed to creator), summary (renamed to description), tags (renamed to subject), label (renamed to bookshelf_label)
        
      preserve_all_jazz_metadata: # Preserve exactly as-is, every single field:
        - cosmic_significance
        - relevance_to_victor
        - paradigm_shift_potential
        - jamming_language
        - key_concepts
        - related_works
        - cultural_significance
        - cultural_artifacts
        # ALL jazz fields must be preserved exactly as they are
        
    4_write_individual_files:
      - Create one YAML file per book using CORRECT category from photo labels
      - Name using book ID + .yml extension  
      - Ensure no duplicates exist

  error_prevention_checklist:
    before_any_action:
      - [ ] Verify book exists in source bookshelf YAML file
      - [ ] Check actual shelf labels in photo  
      - [ ] Identify if this is a duplicate, wrong shelf, or wrong category
      - [ ] Plan rename/delete actions but DO NOT execute until approved
      
    file_operations:
      - [ ] NEVER delete files unless explicitly told to delete specific files
      - [ ] Use mv (rename) for files that belong elsewhere or have wrong categories
      - [ ] Only delete files that are confirmed duplicates after user approval
      
    quality_control:
      - [ ] Every book should exist exactly once
      - [ ] Every category name must match actual photo labels
      - [ ] Every file must correspond to a book in source YAML
      - [ ] No made-up categories allowed

  current_r1_c1_cleanup_needed:
    actual_shelf_labels: ["COMICS", "ANIMATION", "GAME DESIGN", "TYPE"]
    total_books_should_be: 36  # Based on source bookshelf-r1-c1.yml
    
    files_to_delete: # Duplicates and orphaned files
      - Files with fake categories not matching photo labels
      - Duplicate books with different category names
      - Books not found in bookshelf-r1-c1.yml source file
      
    files_to_rename: # Wrong category but correct shelf  
      - Books that exist in r1-c1 but have wrong category label
      - Books with correct content but using "Design" instead of "TYPE"
      
    files_to_move: # Wrong shelf entirely
      - Books that belong on different shelves (check other bookshelf YAML files)

  validation_requirements:
    - Every book file must correspond to entry in source bookshelf YAML
    - Every category must match actual physical shelf label in photo
    - No duplicate books allowed
    - All Internet Archive required fields must be present
    - All original YAML structure must be preserved (except renamed fields)
    - Jazz metadata must be completely intact
    - Bookshelf positioning must be accurate

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE ASSISTANT BEHAVIOR:
assistant_instructions:
  when_user_says_complete_inventory:
    - Check EVERY SINGLE FILE in the directory
    - Compare against EVERY entry in source YAML files
    - Check against ACTUAL shelf labels in photos
    - List ALL discrepancies, not just obvious ones
    - Be thorough and comprehensive
    
  when_identifying_problems:
    - Always verify against source data before making claims
    - Check photos for actual shelf labels
    - Distinguish between duplicates, wrong shelf, wrong category, orphaned files
    - Provide evidence for all conclusions
    
  when_planning_fixes:
    - Show complete list of proposed actions
    - Distinguish between rename, delete, move operations  
    - Get user approval before executing any file operations
    - NEVER delete files without explicit permission
    
  when_making_mistakes:
    - Admit errors immediately and completely
    - Explain what went wrong and why
    - Take full responsibility  
    - Learn from the mistake to prevent repetition
    
  general_principles:
    - Photos and source YAML files are the definitive truth
    - File names and IDs can be wrong/misleading
    - When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than assume
    - Be completely honest about uncertainty
    - Verify everything against primary sources
