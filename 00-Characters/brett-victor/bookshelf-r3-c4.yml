    summary: "A collection of interviews with fifteen of the most interesting and accomplished programmers of our time, including Donald Knuth, Jamie Zawinski, and Frances Allen."
    label: "Computer History"
    key_concepts:
      - "The craft of programming"
      - "Problem-solving approaches"
      - "The evolution of programming"
      - "Oral history of computing"
    relevance_to_victor: "This book provides a ground-level view of how great programmers actually think and work, offering insights into the 'tacit knowledge' that Victor's tools aim to make more explicit and learnable."

      cosmic_significance: "The oral history of code as craft. Seibel captures programming not as engineering but as a deeply personal practice—part art, part science, part philosophy."
      relevance_to_victor: "These interviews reveal the invisible thought processes of master programmers—exactly what Victor's tools try to make visible. Each coder has their own mental models that Victor would want to externalize."
      paradigm_shift_potential: "Showed that there's no one way to program well. The diversity of approaches challenges any dogma about 'best practices' and reveals programming as a fundamentally human activity."
