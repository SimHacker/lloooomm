    jazz:
      cosmic_significance: "A manifesto for the knowledge commons. Hyde argues that culture is like air—it must circulate freely to sustain life. This book is about the oxygen of civilization."
      relevance_to_victor: "Victor's work exists in the tension between proprietary and open knowledge. His tools are about democratizing powerful ideas—making them 'common as air.' This book provides the philosophical foundation for open-source thinking."
      paradigm_shift_potential: "Reframed the debate about intellectual property from economics to ecology—ideas need to flow and mix to evolve."

    summary: "A classic work on the nature of creativity, arguing that art operates as a gift economy rather than a market economy, and that the artist's gift must be freely given to remain alive."
    label: "Creativity & Ideas"
    jazz:
      cosmic_significance: "The book that revealed the secret economy of art. Hyde shows that true creativity operates by different rules than capitalism—it's about abundance, not scarcity; circulation, not hoarding."
      relevance_to_victor: "Victor's work embodies gift economy principles—he shares his ideas freely, creating tools that empower others to create. This book explains why that approach isn't just generous, it's necessary for cultural vitality."
      paradigm_shift_potential: "Revolutionized how artists think about their work and its value, providing a framework for understanding why commodifying creativity often kills it."

    label: "Creativity & Ideas"
    jazz:
      cosmic_significance: "A natural history of the 'aha!' moment. Johnson reveals that innovation isn't individual genius but environmental conditions—ideas are like coral reefs, built slowly through countless small contributions."
      relevance_to_victor: "Victor creates environments for ideas to flourish—his tools are designed to maximize the 'adjacent possible' and enable liquid networks. This book provides the theoretical framework for why his approach works."

      cosmic_significance: "A grand unified theory of creativity, arguing that the 'Aha!' moment in humor, art, and science all share the same fundamental pattern of bisociation."
      relevance_to_victor: "This provides a psychological and philosophical framework for understanding innovation. Victor's work is a constant act of bisociation, connecting ideas from user interface design, mathematics, animation, and pedagogy to create new forms of media."
