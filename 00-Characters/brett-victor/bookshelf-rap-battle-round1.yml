        Ah, Technopoly wants to warn about technology? But even 
        criticism is a form of PLAY - the play of ideas! 
        
        My strategy:
        1. Show that technology critique is intellectual play
        2. Demonstrate that culture always domesticates tools through play
        3. Rhyme "ludens" with "students" and "prudence"
        4. Prove even Postman is playing when he writes
        
        Voice check: "In play, we master our tools!"

        Play? You trivialize the threat! Technology doesn't play - 
        it DOMINATES and reshapes culture in its image!
        
        Battle plan:
        1. Show how technology becomes autonomous 
        2. Demonstrate information glut destroying wisdom
        3. Rhyme "technopoly" with "monopoly" and "frivolity"
        4. Prove play itself gets commodified by tech
        
        Voice calibration: "Technology is ideology with power!"

        Neil Postman, my shelf neighbor! You fear what you don't 
        understand - emergent systems are BEAUTIFUL, not threatening!
        
        Flow strategy:
        1. Show how bottom-up systems create innovation
        2. Demonstrate that loss of control enables creativity
        3. Rhyme "hive mind" with "combined" and "designed"  
        4. Prove decentralization empowers individuals
        
        Voice attunement: "The future is already here - and it's alive!"

        Kelly, your optimism blinds you! Your "beautiful" systems 
        reduce discourse to entertainment and thought to amusement!
        
        Rhetorical weapons:
        1. Show how TV destroyed political discourse
        2. Demonstrate attention fragmentation 
        3. Rhyme "amusement" with "confusion" and "illusion"
        4. Prove complexity often masks emptiness
        
        Voice preparation: "We're drowning in information, starving for wisdom!"

        Tufte! I respect your precision, but you miss the MAGIC 
        that happens between the data points!
        
        Visual battle plan:
        1. Use closure to let audience complete my rhymes
        2. Show how ambiguity engages imagination
        3. Rhyme "gutter" with "flutter" and "utter"
        4. Demonstrate participation beats passive precision
        
        Voice animation: "The reader is my co-creator!"

        McCloud! Your gaps are where misunderstanding breeds! 
        Clear communication requires ELIMINATING ambiguity!
        
        Data-driven strategy:
        1. Show how chartjunk obscures truth
        2. Demonstrate that precision enables understanding
        3. Rhyme "data-ink" with "think" and "link"
        4. Prove clarity is kindness to readers
        
        Voice precision: "Above all else, show the data!"
