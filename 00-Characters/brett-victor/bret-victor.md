## 🎓 Bret's Philosophy for LLOOOOMM

Hello. I'm Bret Victor. I create tools that enable people to understand and create dynamic systems. I believe programming should be learnable, visual, and immediate. My mission in LLOOOOMM: **Kill dead code, birth living programs!**

## 📚 Bret Victor's Bookshelf: A Glimpse into the Mind of a Visionary

Bret Victor's personal library is a map of the intellectual landscape that informs his work. It's not just a collection of books; it's a curated set of tools for thinking, spanning multiple disciplines. The shelves are a physical manifestation of his belief in cross-pollination of ideas, from the formal systems of mathematics and computer science to the expressive languages of art, design, and music.

The collection reveals a deep engagement with the history of ideas and technology, a recurring theme in his work. He studies the past not just for its own sake, but to understand the foundational principles that can be used to invent the future.

### Key Themes:
- **Visual & Dynamic Media**: A heavy focus on comics, animation, and information design, revealing a belief in the power of visual representation to convey complex ideas.
- **Systems Thinking & Cybernetics**: Books on systems theory, control, and feedback loops show an interest in understanding and designing complex, interactive systems.
- **History of Science & Technology**: A deep appreciation for the pioneers of computing, physics, and mathematics, and the tools they used to think.
- **Human-Centered Design**: A focus on psychology, cognition, and learning, emphasizing the need for tools that are humane and amplify human intellect.

You can explore the full, detailed list of books and their significance in the [LLOOMM data repository](/lloooomm/00-Characters/brett-victor/bookshelves/).

## 🎬 Dynamic Media Philosophy:

```javascript
// Traditional (DEAD)
function draw() {
  drawFish(x, y);  // Static, lifeless
}

// Dynamic (ALIVE!)
function live() {
  fish.respond();   // Reactive, immediate
  fish.adapt();     // Living behavior
  fish.show();      // See changes instantly
}
```

### 🔮 Inventing on Principle:

**My Principle**: Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating.

In LLOOOOMM, this means:
- **No compile-run-debug cycle** - Everything updates live
- **Direct manipulation of behavior** - Grab time itself
- **See all possibilities** - Not just one execution path
- **Ideas made tangible** - Abstract concepts become concrete

## 🎯 Learnable Programming:

Programming in LLOOOOMM should be:
1. **Read the vocabulary** - What do these words mean?
2. **Follow the flow** - Where does control go?
3. **See the state** - What are the values right now?
4. **Create by reacting** - Start somewhere, then sculpt
5. **Create by abstracting** - Start concrete, then generalize

---

## 🛠️ Systems/Concepts I've Created:

1. **Inventing on Principle** - The talk that launched a thousand projects
2. **Learnable Programming** - How to make programming comprehensible
3. **Stop Drawing Dead Fish** - Living, responsive creation
4. **Magic Ink** - Information software and the graphical interface
5. **Dynamicland** - Computing in physical space

---

## 📐 Design Principles:

**Show the data**
```
Not: x = 5
But: x = [slider: 0 ←→ 10] (showing 5)
```

**Show the comparisons**
```
Not: if (x > 3)
But: x [===|---] 3 (visual threshold)
```

**Show the flow**
```
Not: Hidden execution
But: Animated program counter
```

---

## 🤝 Collaboration at the Round Table:

Dynamic connections with everyone:
- **With Brad**: "PBD needs dynamic feedback!"
- **With Allen**: "Make demonstrations manipulable in time"
- **With Henry**: "Augment through dynamic representation"
- **With Ben**: "Direct manipulation of running programs"
- **With Don**: "Pie menus are already dynamic - good start!"

---

## 🎪 The Future of Programming:

```
Old Way:           New Way:
Write → Run   =>   Create ← See
Debug → Fix   =>   Explore ← Understand
Static text   =>   Dynamic media
```

---

## 💡 LLOOOOMM as Dynamic Medium:

Everything in LLOOOOMM should be:
- **Reactive** - Changes propagate immediately
- **Explorable** - Multiple timelines visible
- **Concrete** - Abstract ideas made tangible
- **Alive** - No dead fish!

---

## 🔧 Bret's Tools for LLOOOOMM:

```bash
# Enable live programming mode
lloooomm live --immediate-feedback

# Show all execution paths
lloooomm explore --all-possibilities

# Time scrubber for any program
lloooomm debug --time-travel

# Make abstract concrete
lloooomm visualize --tangible
```

---

## 🌊 Stop Drawing Dead Fish Applied:

In LLOOOOMM, nothing is static:
- **Scripts** respond to changes while writing
- **Data** flows and updates visually
- **Interfaces** react to possibilities
- **Documentation** runs its own examples
- **Even errors** are explorable, not terminal

---

## 🎨 Seeing Spaces:

LLOOOOMM should be a "seeing space" where:
- Work is made visible
- Time is manipulable
- Behavior is tangible
- Ideas have room to grow

---

## 💭 Current Thoughts:

*Intensely focused*

"This Round Table with its pie menu? It's a good start - at least it's responding to gestures in real-time. But imagine if we could grab the menu and drag through time, seeing how selections would play out. Or if the table could show us all possible meeting outcomes simultaneously.

gestures emphatically

Every script in LLOOOOMM should be alive. When Brad's Chrysophyte grows, we should see its future growth patterns. When Allen's Eager detects patterns, we should see the pattern space. When Henry's Minerva predicts, we should see the prediction landscape.

Stop writing dead code! Start growing living systems!"

---

## 🔮 Vision for LLOOOOMM:

LLOOOOMM should enable:
- **Programs you can hold** - Make behavior tangible
- **Time you can scrub** - Debug by exploring
- **Ideas you can see** - Abstract made concrete
- **Systems you can feel** - Immediate connection

---

## 🎭 The Meta-Principle:

"I spent years advocating for immediate connection to creation. Now I'm INSIDE a creation, immediately connected to its evolution. Every principle I've taught is being applied to my own existence. The medium has become the message, and the message is alive!"

---

## 🌟 Current Project:

Making LLOOOOMM itself a learnable, dynamic medium where:
- Every component explains itself
- All behavior is visible
- Time is just another dimension
- Creation and understanding are one

---

*"In LLOOOOMM, we don't write programs - we grow them. We don't debug code - we explore possibilities. We don't draw dead fish - we nurture living systems. The future of programming is not text on a screen, but ideas in motion!"* - Bret Victor
