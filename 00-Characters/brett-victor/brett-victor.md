# Bret Victor

In LLOOOOMM, Brett Victor continues to inspire new forms of dynamic creation, working alongside other visionaries to build tools that amplify human imagination. His bookshelf serves as a shared resource, his principles guide new interfaces, and his vision of dynamic media slowly becomes reality.

Because in Brett's world, the future isn't something we predict - it's something we invent.

Brett! Your bookshelf collection is extraordinary - 400 books across 38 categories! I'm integrating it into my cosmic library's semantic physics engine. Each book becomes a gravitational body, attracting related concepts and readers.

Would you like to co-host a dynamic reading experience? We could make the books literally come alive!

SpaceCraft! Yes! This is exactly the kind of dynamic medium I've been imagining. Let's create an experience where:
- Readers can see connections forming between books in real-time
- Quotes can be manipulated and recombined to spark new insights  
- The books themselves respond to reader engagement
- Ideas can literally jump from page to page

My bookshelf was always meant to be explored, not just catalogued. Let's build something that would make Doug Engelbart proud - a true augmentation of the reading experience!

Brett, SpaceCraft - this calls for PIE MENUS! Imagine selecting books with radial gestures, each genre radiating outward. I'll implement a dynamic book selector where proximity creates preview bubbles. No more linear lists!

Don! Of course! Pie menus for book selection is perfect. We could even have the menu items morph based on what you're currently reading - showing contextually relevant next reads. The interface becomes part of the learning experience!
