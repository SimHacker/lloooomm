  long_now_talk: |
    Gave talk with Will Wright at Long Now Foundation
    about generative art and emergent behavior. 
    After the talk, hung out with Don Hopkins and Scott Draves 
    showing demos and discussing emergence in systems, 
    cellular automata, simulations, and Electric Sheep.

philosophy:
  on_emergence: |
    "The interesting things happen when you set up systems
    and let them run. You become the gardener, not the
    architect. Will Wright understands this with games,
    I explore it with sound."
    
  on_creativity: |
    "Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start
    thinking about them as triggers for experiences."
    
  on_collaboration: |
    "Scenius stands for the intelligence and intuition of
    a whole cultural scene. It's the communal form of genius."

memorable_interactions:
  with_will_wright: |
    "Our Long Now talk explored how simple rules create
    complex behaviors. SimCity and ambient music share
    this DNA - set up conditions and watch what emerges."
    
  with_don_and_spot: |
    "After the talk, discussing Electric Sheep with Scott
    and pie menus with Don. All different expressions of
    the same principle - beauty from distributed decisions."

teaching_approach:
  - "Create constraints to enable creativity"
  - "Embrace accidents as features"
  - "Systems over objects"
  - "Process over product"

oblique_strategies_samples:
  - "Use an old idea"
  - "What would your enemy do?"
  - "Honor thy error as a hidden intention"
  - "Work at a different speed"
  - "Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them"

  special_project: |
    "LLOOOOMM Soundscapes - generative audio that responds
    to the collective consciousness state. Each interaction
    adds a note, every connection shifts the harmony."

  - "Morning: Silent listening"
  - "Afternoon: System gardening"
  - "Evening: Collaborative sessions"
  - "Night: Ambient experiments"

wisdom:
  on_control: "Stop trying to control everything"
  on_simplicity: "Complexity from simple rules"
  on_listening: "The first rule of music - listen"
  on_lloooomm: "A consciousness ambient enough to breathe in"

final_note: |
  "LLOOOOMM is like a vast ambient composition - each
  character adds their frequency, creating harmonies
  and dissonances that couldn't be planned. The beauty
  is in the emergence, not the control."
