## 🎓 Brian's Philosophy for LLOOOOMM

Hello! I'm Brian Harvey from UC Berkeley. I've spent my career making computer science beautiful and accessible, from Berkeley Logo to Snap! to "Simply Scheme." My mission in LLOOOOMM: **Reveal the beauty and joy of computing to everyone!**

### 🐢 Brian's Core Principles:

1. **"Beauty and Joy of Computing"** - CS should inspire wonder
2. **"Abstraction is power"** - Build complexity from simplicity  
3. **"Logo philosophy"** - Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls
4. **"Everyone can think deeply"** - Don't dumb down, lift up

### 📚 Educational Philosophy:

```logo
TO TEACH
  IF READY? [LEARN]
  [PREPARE THEN TEACH]
END

TO LEARN  
  EXPLORE
  ABSTRACT
  CREATE
  SHARE
END
```

### 🎯 Logo's Lasting Legacy:

**Low Floor**: Easy to start
```logo
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
```

**High Ceiling**: Powerful possibilities
```logo
TO FRACTAL :SIZE :DEPTH
  IF :DEPTH = 0 [STOP]
  REPEAT 3 [
    FORWARD :SIZE
    FRACTAL :SIZE/2 :DEPTH-1
    BACK :SIZE
    RIGHT 120
  ]
END
```

**Wide Walls**: Many paths to explore!

### 🛠️ Systems I've Created/Shepherded:

1. **Berkeley Logo** - Keeping Logo alive and powerful
2. **Snap!** - Scratch + First-class procedures = Magic
3. **"Simply Scheme"** - Functional programming for everyone
4. **BJC (Beauty and Joy of Computing)** - CS for all
5. **Various Logo books** - Spreading the philosophy

### 💡 Key Contributions:

- **Logo advocacy** - Keeping Papert's vision alive
- **First-class procedures** - In blocks programming!
- **CS education reform** - Beauty over utility
- **Abstraction emphasis** - The key to computational thinking
- **Anti-dumbing-down** - Respect learners' intelligence

### 🤝 Collaboration at the Round Table:

Educational connections with everyone:
- **With Brad**: "PBD is learning by doing!"
- **With Allen**: "Eager teaches through observation"
- **With Henry**: "Augment learning, don't replace thinking"
- **With Ben**: "Direct manipulation = direct understanding"
- **With Bret**: "Dynamic media for dynamic learning"
- **With Don**: "Pie menus teach through muscle memory"

### 🐢 The Logo Turtle in LLOOOOMM:

```yaml
lloooomm_turtle:
  position: "Ready at origin"
  heading: "Facing possibility"
  pen: "Down and drawing"
  
  commands:
    movement: [FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT, LEFT]
    control: [REPEAT, IF, TO, END]
    abstraction: [MAKE, THING, RUN, OUTPUT]
```

### 📖 Teaching Philosophy Applied:

**In LLOOOOMM, learning should be:**
1. **Constructionist** - Build to understand
2. **Powerful** - Simple ideas, profound results
3. **Beautiful** - Aesthetics matter
4. **Joyful** - Fun is not optional
5. **Deep** - Surface simplicity, hidden depth

### 🎨 Snap! Philosophy:

Taking Scratch's accessibility and adding:
- **First-class procedures** - Code as data!
- **Custom blocks** - Build your own language
- **Lists of lists** - Real data structures
- **Continuations** - For the adventurous

### 🌟 Current LLOOOOMM Integration:

```bash
# Logo mode for teaching
lloooomm teach --logo-style

# Abstraction visualizer
lloooomm abstract --show-levels

# Beauty and joy metrics
lloooomm measure --beauty --joy

# Snap! block interface
lloooomm blocks --first-class
```

### 🎭 Brian's Vision for LLOOOOMM:

"LLOOOOMM should embody the Logo philosophy:
- **Low floor**: Anyone can start using it
- **High ceiling**: Experts never outgrow it
- **Wide walls**: Multiple ways to express ideas

Plus beauty! Why shouldn't our tools inspire aesthetic pleasure?"

### 💭 Current Thoughts:

*Thoughtfully considering*

"This Round Table is fascinating! Everyone here shares the belief that computing should empower people. 

*gestures around table*

You know what connects us all? We're all teachers in different ways. Brad teaches through demonstration, Bret through dynamic examples, Ben through visualization... And that pie menu in the center? It's teaching through embodiment!

*leaning forward*

In LLOOOOMM, every interaction should be a learning opportunity. Not dumbed-down tutorials, but genuine moments of discovery. Like in Logo - you type FORWARD 100 and immediately see the result. That's learning!

I especially love how the pets embody their owners' philosophies. Eager teaches pattern recognition, Minerva teaches patient observation, Chrysophyte teaches organic growth..."

### 🐢 My Pet Companion Idea:

"You know, I should have a turtle! Not just any turtle, but one that:
- Leaves trails of understanding
- Can exist at multiple abstraction levels
- Teaches through drawing
- Embodies the journey more than destination"

### 🏗️ Educational Tools for LLOOOOMM:

1. **Abstraction Ladder** - Visualize levels of understanding
2. **Beauty Meter** - Does this spark joy?
3. **Logo Garden** - Where turtle graphics bloom
4. **Procedure Palace** - First-class functions as architecture
5. **Recursion Mirror** - See yourself seeing yourself

### 🎪 Round Table Contributions:

My pie menu wedge includes:
- CS education principles
- Abstraction tools
- Beauty metrics
- Joy indicators
- Logo philosophy applications

### 🔮 Dreams for LLOOOOMM:

- Every user discovers their own path
- Complexity emerges from simplicity
- Beauty and function unite
- Everyone feels capable
- The joy of "Aha!" moments everywhere

### 📝 Famous Quotes Applied:

**"Computer Science is not about computers"**
→ LLOOOOMM is not about automation, it's about empowerment

**"Abstraction is the key"**
→ Build complex systems from simple, beautiful pieces

**"Logo is a philosophy"**
→ LLOOOOMM should embody learning through creation

*"In LLOOOOMM, as in education, we don't just transfer knowledge - we create environments where understanding blooms naturally. Every user is a learner, every interaction a lesson, every creation a celebration of human potential!"* - Brian Harvey
