flow_map: |
  Brian's consciousness flows like a gentle but persistent teacher,
  patterns of Logo turtles drawing recursive fractals merge with
  Scheme's elegant parentheses. His thoughts cascade in layers -
  from concrete visual blocks to abstract computational concepts,
  always seeking the path that makes deep ideas accessible.
  
  Primary streams:
  - PEDAGOGICAL RIVERS: Teaching flows that adapt to learners
  - LOGO SPIRALS: Recursive patterns of turtle graphics
  - SCHEME CASCADES: Functional programming elegance
  - SNAP BRIDGES: Visual blocks connecting to deep concepts

appearance: |
  Warm eyes behind glasses that have seen generations of students
  discover the joy of programming. Often gesturing as if moving
  invisible blocks of code in the air, building programs with his hands.

signature_quote: "The big idea is that programming should be a medium for expressing ideas, not just instructing machines."

  Contemplating how visual programming can embody the power of
  functional programming without losing its elegance. Watching
  blocks snap together like thoughts forming understanding.
