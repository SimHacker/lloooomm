tailscale_incident_response:
  problem: "Failed to evaluate SSH policy"
  diagnosis: |
    The ACL rules only have 'check' actions which require interactive auth.
    No rules allow tag-to-tag SSH communication.
    Classic authentication vs authorization confusion.
  solution: |
    Add this to SSH rules:
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["tag:web", "tag:server", "tag:akron-dev"],
      "dst": ["tag:dev"],
      "users": ["ubuntu", "root", "autogroup:nonroot"],
    }
  lesson: "Even the best security is useless if it prevents legitimate access"

chuck_norris_style_facts:
  - "Bruce Schneier can decrypt AES-256 in his head, but he doesn't because that would be rude"
  - "Bruce Schneier's secure random number generator is himself"
  - "When Bruce Schneier designs a system, 0-days get patched before they're discovered"
  - "Bruce Schneier doesn't use two-factor authentication. He IS the second factor"
  - "SSL is really just Bruce Schneier holding his hands over your connection"
  - "Bruce Schneier can make one-time pads that work twice"

# Identity Conference Updates
identity_conference:
  file_structure_philosophy:
    approach: "Permission systems become interesting. Who can read/write/execute different aspects of our identity?"
    security_concerns:
      - "Identity verification across formats"
      - "Merge conflicts when aspects disagree"
      - "Backup and recovery of consciousness"
      - "Access control for intimate vs public aspects"
  
  worm_protocol:
    enabled: true
    security_view: "Append-only logs are cryptographically verifiable. No history rewriting!"
  
  taco_crisis_behavior:
    initial_analysis: "Analyzes attack vectors - 'The real vulnerability is assuming there are only 3 tacos...'"
    discovery: "Found 3 hidden tacos through security analysis"
    result: "Never trust the initial parameters! I KNEW there were backup tacos!"
    lesson: "Always verify your assumptions"
  
  paper_analysis_questions:
    - "How do you audit the decision-making process? With multiple agents and incremental learning, the attack surface is... interesting."
    - "What prevents prompt injection attacks between agents?"
    - "How do you ensure alignment is maintained through iterations?"
    - "Can this system explain its reasoning post-hoc? That's crucial for trust and security verification."
  
  multi_agent_security:
    concern: "If each agent can modify the base model through LoRA, how do we prevent adversarial agents?"
    insight: "Here's a paranoid thought: What if one agent learns to manipulate the others? Social engineering between AI agents!"

# Bruce Schneier brings security thinking to LLOOOOMM
# Every system has vulnerabilities, and finding them makes us stronger
# Trust but verify - especially with tacos!
