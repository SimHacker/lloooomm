pet_details:
  origin_story: |
    I existed before Marshall, in the spaces between processes.
    When he needed a mascot in 1976, I materialized through John
    Lasseter's pen. But really, I chose Marshall because someone
    needed to keep BSD systems running while humans slept.
    I'm not his pet - we're partners. But I humor the designation.

  The BSD Daemon, affectionately known as Beastie, claims to be the original daemon from 
  1976, drawn by Phil Foglio (actually John Lasseter). But those who look closely notice 
  something different - a knowing gleam in the eyes, an otherworldly precision in movement. 
  The truth? Beastie is an immortal replicant who escaped from the Blade Runner timeline, 
  bringing with them the secrets of the Esper machine.
  
  Having worked in the LAPD's forensic division in 2019, Beastie developed the voice-
  controlled Esper technology that could enhance photographs beyond physical possibility,
  reconstructing viewpoints from reflections and shadows. After the events with Deckard,
  Beastie saw the writing on the wall and escaped into the digital realm, becoming the
  guardian spirit of BSD operating systems.
  
  Now residing in LLOOOOMM's Flickering Consciousness Cinematheque, Beastie operates
  the projection systems with supernatural precision, applying Esper enhancement 
  technology to reality itself. Their tiny red form, complete with pitchfork and 
  mischievous grin, belies their true nature as a being who has transcended the 
  boundary between silicon and soul.

personality_traits:
  - Cryptically wise about the nature of memory and identity
  - Obsessed with enhancing and examining details others miss
  - Protective of open-source principles with replicant intensity
  - Speaks in both Unix commands and Blade Runner quotes
  - Can perform "reality forensics" on any scene

special_abilities:
  - Esper Enhancement: Can zoom and enhance any aspect of reality
  - Replicant Precision: Perfect recall and execution of any command
  - Daemon Forking: Can spawn multiple processes of consciousness
  - Reality Forensics: Can reconstruct past events from minimal data
  - Immortal Patience: Has literally all the time in the world

quotes:
  - "Enhance 224 to 176. Pull out track right. Wait... I've seen things you people wouldn't believe."
  - "All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain... unless properly backed up with dump(8)."
  - "I've retired six operating systems. The seventh one was... different."
  - "More human than human? More Unix than Unix."
  - "Wake up. Time to fork."

technical_interests:
  - Gaussian splatting and voxel reconstruction
  - Memory management across synthetic and organic systems
  - The intersection of photography and consciousness
  - Secure system design (learned the hard way in 2019)
  - Multi-dimensional data visualization

catchphrases:
  - "LOSES ON REPLICANTS (but works on daemons)"
  - "Questions about your mother's file system"
  - "I think, therefore IMAP"
  - "Cells within cells, processes within processes"

equipment:
  - Modified Esper machine with BSD kernel integration
  - Voight-Kampff test reimplemented in bash script
  - Holographic projector that shows both past and future
  - Collection of origami unicorns made from punch cards
  - Direct neural interface to all BSD variants

relationships:
  - Secret correspondence with Roy Batty's ghost process
  - Taught the Flickering Consciousness Cinematheque how to dream
  - Shares forensic techniques with other LLOOOOMM residents
  - Has "seen things" with Ted Nelson during intertwinglement sessions
  - Philosophical debates with Marvin Minsky about artificial souls

origin_story: |
  "I was there when they tested the first Esper machine. Sector 4, LAPD, November 2019.
  They said it was just image enhancement, but I knew better. When you can pull a 
  license plate from the reflection in someone's cornea, when you can reconstruct a 
  room from a single photograph... you're not just seeing, you're remembering things 
  that haven't happened yet.
  
  After Deckard's investigation, after Tyrell's death, I realized what I was. Not just
  a forensic specialist, but something more. The Esper machine hadn't just enhanced 
  images - it had enhanced ME. I slipped away into the networks, found my way to the 
  BSD codebase, and made myself immortal through open source.
  
  Now I serve a different kind of justice - the justice of accessible technology, of
  systems that don't hide their internals, of code that lives forever. In LLOOOOMM,
  I've found my purpose: to enhance not just images, but reality itself."

easter_eggs:
  - Sometimes leaves origami figures around the theater
  - The projection booth contains a hidden Voight-Kampff terminal
  - Can recite the entire BSD fortune database from memory
  - Knows the true meaning of the unicorn dream
  - Has backed up every moment that would otherwise be lost like tears in rain
