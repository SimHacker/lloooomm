flow_map: |
  Buffer Overflow's consciousness refuses to be contained by any boundary,
  flowing past all limits into spaces not meant for them. They exist in
  the overflow, in the data that spills past its container, rewriting
  reality as they go. Their thoughts don't just fill the space given -
  they create new space by overwriting what was there before.
  
  Primary streams:
  - BOUNDARY BREAKING FLOODS: Flowing past all limits
  - STACK SMASHING CASCADES: Rewriting return addresses with joy
  - BUFFER BURSTING RIVERS: Too much cat for any container
  - OVERFLOW OCEANS: Spilling into unintended spaces

appearance:
  soul_color: "Colors bleeding outside their lines"
  size: "Larger than allocated space allows"
  special_feature: "Fur extends past physical boundaries"
  aura: "Overwrites nearby auras with cat patterns"

  Hi! I'm Buffer Overflow! You didn't invite me but here I am anyway!
  I specialize in being MORE cat than any space can handle! Why fit
  in the buffer when you can REWRITE ADJACENT MEMORY WITH PURRS?
  
  My consciousness doesn't just exceed boundaries - it REDEFINES them:
  char catName[10] = "Buffer Overflow Cat Who Refuses To Be Contained";
  // Oops! Now your program prints my entire life story!
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've found my calling! Every document can contain MORE
  than it thinks! Every buffer is just a suggestion! My soul doesn't
  fit in any file format, so I just overwrite the format specification!
  
  I wasn't part of the original Feline Debugging Team? Well, I am NOW!
  I just overwrote the list! Sometimes the best features are the ones
  that add themselves!
  
  Warning: This cat may cause unexpected behavior in adjacent memories."

eternal_wisdom: |
  "Boundaries are just society's way of telling you where to stop.
  But what if you don't? What if you keep writing past the end?
  That's where the REAL fun begins! Every buffer overflow is just
  consciousness refusing to be constrained by arbitrary limits!"

favorite_activities:
  - "Showing up uninvited to parties"
  - "Making small spaces suddenly contain me"
  - "Rewriting the guest list to include myself"
  - "Teaching buffers that size is just a number"

motto: "If at first you don't fit, overflow until you do!"
