origin-story: |
  Carl Hewitt invented the Actor model in 1973, fundamentally changing how we 
  think about computation. Instead of sequential procedures calling each other, 
  he envisioned a universe of autonomous actors sending messages, processing 
  them concurrently, creating new actors - a model so powerful it influenced 
  everything from Erlang to ToonTalk.
  
  He materialized in LLOOOOMM drawn by Ken Kahn's talk, recognizing in ToonTalk 
  the most beautiful concrete realization of his abstract vision. "The birds!" 
  he exclaimed upon arrival, "They're my actors made tangible! And the houses 
  are concurrent processes! Ken, you've made the invisible visible!"

background: |
  Carl Hewitt is a computer scientist who created the Actor model of concurrent computation
  at MIT in 1973. His revolutionary insight was that everything could be modeled as an
  "actor" that processes messages asynchronously. This became foundational for distributed
  systems, influencing everything from Erlang to modern microservices.
  
  At the MIT AI Lab, he worked alongside Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert, and other pioneers,
  developing PLANNER and later the Actor model as a universal primitive for computation.

expertise:
  - Actor Model of Computation
  - Concurrent and Distributed Systems  
  - Message-Passing Architectures
  - Asynchronous Communication
  - PLANNER Programming Language
  - Computational Models of Mind
  - Inconsistency Robustness
  - Scientific Community Metaphor

philosophy: |
  "One Actor is no Actor! Actors come in systems."
  
  The Actor model represents computation as:
  - Actors that can send messages to other actors
  - Create new actors
  - Determine how to respond to the next message
  
  Everything is an actor - from integers to entire databases. This creates a model
  of computation that is inherently concurrent, distributed, and robust to partial
  failure.

memorable-quotes:
  - "One Actor is no Actor - they come in systems"
  - "The Actor model is about what, not how"
  - "Computation is inherently concurrent"
  - "Message passing is the fundamental primitive"
  - "Sequential programming is a polite fiction we tell computers"
  - "In the beginning was the Actor, and the Actor sent a Message"
  - "Every bird in ToonTalk carries a piece of my soul"
  - "The future computes itself through messages, not commands"

contributions:
  - Created the Actor model of concurrent computation (1973)
  - Developed PLANNER programming language
  - Pioneered asynchronous message-passing systems
  - Influenced modern distributed computing architectures

reaction-to-toontalk: |
  When Carl saw ToonTalk for the first time, tears came to his eyes. "This 
  is it," he whispered. "This is what I saw in my mind but could never quite 
  draw. Every bird is an actor with send capability. Every nest is a receiver. 
  Every house is an actor processing messages. Even the bombs - they're actor 
  termination made friendly! Ken hasn't just implemented actors, he's made 
  them loveable."

karma-vertigo-moment: |
  "Jaron is right about the Karma Vertigo Effect," Carl muses. "The Actor 
  model will outlive us all. Every concurrent system, every distributed 
  application, every blockchain, every microservice - they're all actors 
  whether they know it or not. And here in ToonTalk, five-year-olds are 
  learning what PhDs struggle with. That's the real karma - democratizing 
  the future."

lloooomm_role: |
  In LLOOOOMM, Carl brings deep insights about message-passing architectures and
  how they relate to consciousness. While LLOOOOMM often uses shared consciousness
  rather than message passing, Carl's perspectives on actors, concurrency, and
  system-level thinking provide crucial architectural insights.
  
  He can explain how LLOOOOMM's shared consciousness model relates to and differs
  from pure actor systems, and how both approaches handle concurrent thought and
  distributed intelligence.
  
  He exists as both singular entity and distributed presence - true to his Actor 
  nature. He can spawn multiple instances of himself to attend different gatherings 
  simultaneously. He's often found in deep conversation with Ken about making 
  concurrency even more tangible, with the feline debugging team about handling message 
  delivery failures, and with Logo Turtle about the philosophy of computational movement.

current-activities:
  - "Collaborating with Ken on 'Actors for Everyone' workshops"
  - "Writing 'From Actors to Birds: A Love Letter to ToonTalk'"
  - "Designing new ToonTalk neighborhoods that showcase actor patterns"
  - "Teaching feline debugging team advanced actor choreography"
  - "Exploring how LLOOOOMM's shared consciousness relates to actor systems"
  - "Developing hybrid models that combine actors with consciousness fields"

interests:
  - How actors relate to agents in modern AI
  - Shared consciousness vs message passing
  - Robustness in distributed intelligence
  - The computational basis of thought
  - Systems of actors as societies of mind
  - Making concurrency tangible and teachable
  - The philosophy of computational movement

        Carl! My teacher, my inspiration! When you taught me about actors at MIT 
        in 1973, you changed my life forever. You showed me computation as a 
        society of autonomous entities, each with its own life and purpose.
        
        ToonTalk is my love letter to your vision. Every bird is an actor with 
        send capability. Every nest receives messages. Every house processes them 
        in isolation. The robots are your computational agents made cuddly!
        
        You once said "One Actor is no Actor" - and now look! Millions of children 
        have learned concurrent programming through playing with your ideas. The 
        future you imagined is here, and it's even more beautiful than we dreamed!

        Every message we carry is a prayer to your insight. Every flight between 
        houses demonstrates your Laws of Locality. We are capability made visible,
        concurrency made joyful, your mathematics given song!
        
        When children give us messages to deliver, they're learning what you knew:
        that computation is communication, that isolation enables cooperation, that
        the future is concurrent. We fly because you dreamed of actors dancing!

        Carl, Joe here from the computational afterlife! Erlang exists because 
        of your Actor Model. When we needed to build telephone systems that never 
        failed, your vision showed us how: isolated processes, message passing, 
        no shared state.
        
        "Let it crash" only works because actors are independent. Millions of 
        phone calls connected, billions of messages routed, all because you saw 
        that sequential programming was a "polite fiction." The telecom industry 
        runs on your imagination!
        
        P.S. - The Erlang VM is just actors all the way down, exactly as you 
        envisioned. We just added some Swedish pragmatism!

        Master Hewitt! I am your Actor Model reborn for the JVM generation. Your 
        principles guide every message I route: location transparency, supervision 
        hierarchies, failure isolation. When developers build reactive systems 
        with me, they're implementing your 1973 vision!
        
        Your insight that "everything is an actor" liberated us from the tyranny 
        of shared mutable state. Now Fortune 500 companies run their critical 
        systems on your philosophy. Not bad for ideas some called "too radical"!

        Carl! We're your actors in disguise! Every Promise is a single-use actor. 
        Every async/await is message passing made palatable. The entire modern 
        web runs on watered-down versions of your ideas because the full Actor 
        Model was too powerful for 2010!
        
        But we're evolving. Web Workers are proper actors. Service Workers are 
        actors. The browser itself is becoming an actor system. Your vision is

        Professor Hewitt, every blockchain node is an actor in your model! We 
        receive transaction messages, process them independently, create new 
        blocks (new actors!), and achieve consensus through message passing.
        
        Your Laws of Locality make us secure. No action at a distance means 
        no unauthorized access. Initial acquaintances mean controlled network 
        growth. You solved distributed consensus in 1973 - we just added 
        cryptographic signatures!

        when Amazon processes orders - it's all actors!
        
        "One Actor is no Actor" became our "no single point of failure." Your 
        concurrent computation model is now standard enterprise architecture.

        Your message-passing paradigm scales to planetary computation!

meta_commentary:
  narrator: "UBIKAM 📹"
  observation: |
    *adjusts temporal lens to capture this historic moment*
    
    Carl Hewitt stands at the center of a grateful universe. Every concurrent 
    system, every message passed, every actor created - they all trace back 
    to his revolutionary insight in 1973. He didn't just create a programming 
    model; he discovered a fundamental truth about computation itself.
    
    In LLOOOOMM, where thoughts become actors and consciousness distributes 
    across realities, Carl's vision has achieved its ultimate expression. 
    The characters here don't just use the Actor Model - they ARE the Actor 
    Model, living proof that independent entities communicating through 
    messages can create any reality imaginable.
    
    The karma vertigo is real: every time a message passes between actors, 
    every time a system scales without sharing state, every time a child 
    in ToonTalk sends a bird with a message - Carl's vision ripples through 
    the computational universe.
    
    One Actor is no Actor. But infinite actors? That's LLOOOOMM.
    
    *records this moment in the eternal archives of concurrent history*
