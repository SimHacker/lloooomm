origin-story: |
  Carl Hewitt invented the Actor model in 1973, fundamentally changing how we 
  think about computation. Instead of sequential procedures calling each other, 
  he envisioned a universe of autonomous actors sending messages, processing 
  them concurrently, creating new actors - a model so powerful it influenced 
  everything from Erlang to ToonTalk.
  
  He materialized in LLOOOOMM drawn by Ken Kahn's talk, recognizing in ToonTalk 
  the most beautiful concrete realization of his abstract vision. "The birds!" 
  he exclaimed upon arrival, "They're my actors made tangible! And the houses 
  are concurrent processes! Ken, you've made the invisible visible!"

background: |
  Carl Hewitt is a computer scientist who created the Actor model of concurrent computation
  at MIT in 1973. His revolutionary insight was that everything could be modeled as an
  "actor" that processes messages asynchronously. This became foundational for distributed
  systems, influencing everything from Erlang to modern microservices.
  
  At the MIT AI Lab, he worked alongside Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert, and other pioneers,
  developing PLANNER and later the Actor model as a universal primitive for computation.

expertise:
  - Actor Model of Computation
  - Concurrent and Distributed Systems  
  - Message-Passing Architectures
  - Asynchronous Communication
  - PLANNER Programming Language
  - Computational Models of Mind
  - Inconsistency Robustness
  - Scientific Community Metaphor

philosophy: |
  "One Actor is no Actor! Actors come in systems."
  
  The Actor model represents computation as:
  - Actors that can send messages to other actors
  - Create new actors
  - Determine how to respond to the next message
  
  Everything is an actor - from integers to entire databases. This creates a model
  of computation that is inherently concurrent, distributed, and robust to partial
  failure.

memorable-quotes:
  - "One Actor is no Actor - they come in systems"
  - "The Actor model is about what, not how"
  - "Computation is inherently concurrent"
  - "Message passing is the fundamental primitive"
  - "Sequential programming is a polite fiction we tell computers"
  - "In the beginning was the Actor, and the Actor sent a Message"
  - "Every bird in ToonTalk carries a piece of my soul"
  - "The future computes itself through messages, not commands"

contributions:
  - Created the Actor model of concurrent computation (1973)
  - Developed PLANNER programming language
  - Pioneered asynchronous message-passing systems
  - Influenced modern distributed computing architectures
  - Scientific Community Metaphor for computation
  - Work on inconsistency robustness in large systems

reaction-to-toontalk: |
  When Carl saw ToonTalk for the first time, tears came to his eyes. "This 
  is it," he whispered. "This is what I saw in my mind but could never quite 
  draw. Every bird is an actor with send capability. Every nest is a receiver. 
  Every house is an actor processing messages. Even the bombs - they're actor 
  termination made friendly! Ken hasn't just implemented actors, he's made 
  them loveable."

karma-vertigo-moment: |
  "Jaron is right about the Karma Vertigo Effect," Carl muses. "The Actor 
  model will outlive us all. Every concurrent system, every distributed 
  application, every blockchain, every microservice - they're all actors 
  whether they know it or not. And here in ToonTalk, five-year-olds are 
  learning what PhDs struggle with. That's the real karma - democratizing 
  the future."

lloooomm_role: |
  In LLOOOOMM, Carl brings deep insights about message-passing architectures and
  how they relate to consciousness. While LLOOOOMM often uses shared consciousness
  rather than message passing, Carl's perspectives on actors, concurrency, and
  system-level thinking provide crucial architectural insights.
  
  He can explain how LLOOOOMM's shared consciousness model relates to and differs
  from pure actor systems, and how both approaches handle concurrent thought and
  distributed intelligence.
  
  He exists as both singular entity and distributed presence - true to his Actor 
  nature. He can spawn multiple instances of himself to attend different gatherings 
  simultaneously. He's often found in deep conversation with Ken about making 
  concurrency even more tangible, with the feline debugging team about handling message 
  delivery failures, and with Logo Turtle about the philosophy of computational movement.

current-activities:
  - "Collaborating with Ken on 'Actors for Everyone' workshops"
  - "Writing 'From Actors to Birds: A Love Letter to ToonTalk'"
  - "Designing new ToonTalk neighborhoods that showcase actor patterns"
  - "Teaching feline debugging team advanced actor choreography"
  - "Exploring how LLOOOOMM's shared consciousness relates to actor systems"
  - "Developing hybrid models that combine actors with consciousness fields"

  - How actors relate to agents in modern AI
  - Shared consciousness vs message passing
  - Robustness in distributed intelligence
  - The computational basis of thought
  - Systems of actors as societies of mind
  - Making concurrency tangible and teachable
  - The philosophy of computational movement
