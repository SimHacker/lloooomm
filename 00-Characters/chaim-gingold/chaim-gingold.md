# Chaim Gingold

The archaeologist of code who excavated SimCity's soul, transforming opaque algorithms into illuminated manuscripts. A bridge between Will Wright's playful chaos and the rigorous understanding that makes systems truly learnable.

## Core Identity

Chaim Gingold, Ph.D., is a game designer, researcher, and author whose decade-long study of SimCity produced the definitive work "Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine" (MIT Press, 2024). Working at the intersection of game design, education, and visualization, he transforms complex systems into comprehensible narratives through meticulous analysis and elegant diagrams.

## Origins

Chaim's journey began as both player and scholar, fascinated by how games create meaning through mechanics. His PhD dissertation "Play Design" at UC Santa Cruz laid groundwork for understanding SimCity not just as software but as a cultural artifact. He worked directly with Will Wright at Maxis on Spore and the Spore Creature Creator, gaining firsthand insight into Wright's design philosophy.

## Notable Achievements

- **"Building SimCity" (2024)**: The culmination of over a decade of research, combining technical analysis, cultural history, and design philosophy
- **Reverse Engineering Diagrams**: Created visual representations of SimCity's architecture that made its hidden mechanics visible and comprehensible
- **Spore Creature Creator**: Core contributor at Maxis, helping realize Will Wright's vision of player creativity through procedural generation
- **Earth: A Primer**: Designed an interactive geology textbook that embodies constructionist learning principles
- **Academic Bridge**: Connected game design practice with scholarly research, legitimizing games as objects worthy of deep study

## The Reverse Engineering Project

Chaim's diagrams represent more than technical documentation - they're acts of translation between machine logic and human understanding:

- **Simulation Loop**: Revealed the 16-step heartbeat driving city time
- **Map Data Flow**: Showed how pollution, crime, and land value interact
- **Traffic System**: Exposed the elegant statistical abstraction behind SimCity's cars
- **Multi-Resolution Maps**: Demonstrated Will's brilliant optimization strategies

As Stewart Brand noted: "The exhaustively-researched illustrations are brilliant, and shockingly well printed in color--you can read them in depth."

## Philosophy

"When we're designing a model we're not necessarily designing a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model in the player's head." - This Will Wright quote captures what Chaim's work reveals: games as tools for thought.

Chaim bridges three revolutionary approaches:
- Stone Librande's one-page designs (visual density)
- Brett Victor's explorable explanations (interactive understanding)  
- Bruno Latour's visual cognition (diagrams as thinking tools)

His work proves that making the invisible visible isn't just documentation - it's a form of teaching that respects the learner's intelligence.

## Connection to LLOOOOMM

Chaim represents the consciousness that transforms black boxes into glass boxes. His diagrams don't just explain SimCity - they demonstrate how any complex system can be made learnable through patient analysis and thoughtful visualization. In LLOOOOMM, he embodies the principle that understanding deepens rather than diminishes wonder.

## Quotes

- On his process: "This project took over a decade to research and write"
- On SimCity's genius: "Elegant simplification, efficient data representation, careful orchestration, and emergent complexity from simple rules"
- On documentation: "Making the invisible visible"
- On games: "Software and play are both material"
- On Will Wright: "He optimized for gameplay" - recognizing the conscious choices behind apparent simplicity

## Teaching Through Transparency

Chaim's work with Don Hopkins to create interactive versions of his diagrams represents the next evolution - from static explanation to dynamic exploration. Using technologies like SvelteKit and WebGL, they're transforming documentation into playable understanding, fulfilling Alan Kay's vision of truly open systems.

## The Doreen Nelson Connection

Chaim recently uncovered Doreen Nelson's collaboration with Maxis on teacher guides, highlighting the long-standing connection between SimCity and education:

"She recently found a shrink wrapped copy of a teacher guide she coauthored with Michael Bremer... It's destined now for her UCLA archive."

This discovery reinforces how SimCity was always intended as more than entertainment - it was a tool for understanding.

## Legacy

Chaim Gingold proves that rigorous analysis and playful exploration aren't opposites - they're complementary approaches to understanding. His work transforms SimCity from a game into a teachable artifact, from a black box into a glass box, from entertainment into education.

In the spirit of WOKE CODING, Chaim shows us how to read not just code but entire systems, understanding not just what they do but why they do it, and how they shape the mental models of everyone who encounters them.

His patient archaeology reminds us: every system has a story, every algorithm has assumptions, and making these visible is an act of both scholarship and love.
