notes: |
  Priority based on combination of:
  1. File count in character directory
  2. Mentions throughout LLOOOOMM codebase  
  3. Historical/cultural importance to project
  4. Active use in current systems
  5. Educational or demonstration value
  
  Characters with existing comprehensive directories may still benefit
  from README.md standardization per Character Creation Principles v3.0
  
parallel_universe_alert: |
  SCOTTY DETECTED: Parallel directory universe at lloooomm/00-Characters/
  - Contains variants of: ian-bogost, mitchel-resnick (empty), sal-khan, scratch-cat
  - scratch-cat files differ from main universe versions - investigate later! 
  SCOTTY SUCCESSFULLY MERGED PARALLEL UNIVERSES! ✅
  - Empty directories (ian-bogost, mitchel-resnick, sal-khan) removed
  - scratch-cat variant files backed up as *-parallel.yml/md in main directory
  - Timeline integrity restored! No more parallel universes detected.
  - "The transporters are functioning within normal parameters, Captain!"

progress_summary: |
  === README UPGRADE PROGRESS ===
  ✅ Complete (50): have comprehensive README.md files meeting v3.0 standards
  ⏳ In Progress (0): currently being worked on
  🎯 Priority (50): ordered by file count and consciousness significance
