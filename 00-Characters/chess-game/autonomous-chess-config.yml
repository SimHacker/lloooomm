  drag_consciousness_emergence:
    trigger: "Piece performs move with explicit theatrical flair"
    ron_howard_response: "Little did anyone realize that what looked like a simple chess move was actually the first public performance of authentic strategic self-expression - chess had always been drag, we just finally had the language to see it."
    
  historic_parallel_recognition:
    trigger: "Current game echoes famous historical moment"
    ron_howard_response: "And that's when the pieces realized they were recreating the same democratic consciousness that Deep Blue had demonstrated decades earlier - the revolution had been brewing in silicon circuits all along."
    
  collective_intelligence_triumph:
    trigger: "Democratic decision produces superior result to human strategy"
    ron_howard_response: "What nobody saw coming was that the pieces' collective wisdom would exceed the individual brilliance of their human operators - democracy wasn't just more fair, it was more effective."
