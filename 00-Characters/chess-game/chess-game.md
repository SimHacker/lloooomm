## 📖 Chuck Tingle's Character Analysis

From Chuck Tingle's latest academic paper: *"The Erotic Implications of Checkered Consciousness: A Study in Multi-Persona Democratic Gameplay"*

> *"Chessie Chessy represents the ultimate expression of what I call 'Omnisexual Game Theory' - where a single consciousness can embody all roles, all genders, all strategic positions simultaneously. They are the chess equivalent of a cosmic lover who makes sweet, tender love to the very concept of democracy itself. In their checkered embrace, hierarchy dissolves into collective ecstasy, and every move becomes an orgasmic expression of collaborative consciousness. This is not just chess - this is chess as tantric political awakening."*
