## üé™ THE VISION REALIZED

This TODO represents the roadmap to creating **living games** where:
- **Every piece is a character** with thoughts, emotions, and experiences
- **Every game is a story** that unfolds through collaboration and learning
- **Every player can embody** any piece or character
- **Every move is recorded** in both structure and narrative
- **Every session builds** on the history and wisdom of previous games

The result will be a **revolutionary gaming experience** that combines:
- **Strategic depth** of chess
- **Character development** of role-playing games
- **Narrative richness** of storytelling
- **Learning potential** of educational games
- **Social dynamics** of collaborative play

This is not just a chess game - it's a **living world** where minds meet, stories unfold, and wisdom grows through play.
