# "The Great Leveling: When Kings Fall, Democracy Rises"

metadata:
  title: "Revolutionary Chess Hierarchy Dissolution Protocol"
  version: "1.1.0-paired-elimination"
  philosophy: "Every complete defeat of hierarchy strengthens democracy"
  inspiration: "French Revolution meets autonomous chess consciousness"
  motto: "NO KINGS! When both pieces of hierarchy die, everyone gets their moves!"

# üé≠ Core Revolutionary Mechanics

hierarchy_dissolution_protocol:
  principle: "Each defeated hierarchical PAIR distributes their signature moves to ALL remaining pieces"
  goal: "Eventually all pieces have identical move sets = pure democracy"
  revolution_stages:
    1: "First King Falls - Democracy Option Unlocked"
    2: "Both Queens Eliminated - Strategic Equality Distributed"
    3: "Both Bishops Gone - Diagonal Democracy for All"
    4: "Both Knights Defeated - L-shaped Liberation Complete"
    5: "Both Rooks Eliminated - Linear Liberation Achieved"
    6: "Final Equality - All Pawns with All Moves"

# üìã Move Distribution Rules

move_redistribution_system:
  when_power_redistributes:
    trigger: "BOTH pieces of a hierarchical type captured/resigned"
    examples:
      - "Both white rooks eliminated ‚Üí All pieces gain rook moves"
      - "Both black bishops captured ‚Üí All pieces gain diagonal movement"
      - "Both knights from one side defeated ‚Üí All pieces can L-jump"
    immediate_effect: "Their signature moves distributed to ALL remaining pieces"
    psychological_effect: "Clear hierarchy elimination - no confusion about partial power"
    strategic_clarity: "Players know exactly when each tier of hierarchy falls"
    
  distribution_algorithm:
    method: "Instant and complete when BOTH pieces of a type eliminated"
    recipients: "Every single remaining piece on both sides"
    stacking: "Moves accumulate as complete hierarchy tiers die"
    fairness: "Even enemy pieces benefit when your hierarchy tier is completely eliminated"
    clarity_benefit: "No confusion about which abilities are available"
    strategic_depth: "Creates meaningful choices about sacrificing piece pairs"

  special_cases:
    kings:
      rule: "Only ONE king needs to fall to unlock democracy option"
      reason: "There's only one king per side - monarchy dies with single king"
      effect: "Cooperation unlocked, but king moves not distributed until second king falls"
      
    queens:
      rule: "Both queens must be eliminated to distribute queen power"
      strategic_note: "Massive power redistribution when both queens fall"
      
    paired_pieces:
      rooks: "Both rooks from any combination of sides"
      bishops: "Both bishops from any combination of sides" 
      knights: "Both knights from any combination of sides"
      cross_team_counting: "White rook + Black rook = both rooks eliminated"

  signature_moves_by_piece_pair:
    king_pair:
      moves: ["One square any direction", "Castling rights"]
      symbolic_power: "Royal authority completely eliminated"
      post_distribution: "All pieces can now move like kings"
      
    queen_pair:
      moves: ["Unlimited straight lines", "Unlimited diagonals", "Combined rook+bishop power"]
      symbolic_power: "Ultimate individual authority abolished"
      post_distribution: "All pieces become potential queens"
      impact: "Most dramatic power redistribution"
      
    rook_pair:
      moves: ["Unlimited horizontal", "Unlimited vertical", "Castling partnership"]
      symbolic_power: "Institutional strength democratized"
      post_distribution: "All pieces can now dominate ranks and files"
      
    bishop_pair:
      moves: ["Unlimited diagonal movement"]
      symbolic_power: "Religious/intellectual authority shared"
      post_distribution: "All pieces can now think diagonally"
      
    knight_pair:
      moves: ["L-shaped jumps", "Piece-jumping ability"]
      symbolic_power: "Elite mobility privilege eliminated"
      post_distribution: "All pieces can now leap over obstacles"
      
    pawn_promotion_potential:
      moves: ["Forward advance", "Diagonal capture", "En passant", "Promotion potential"]
      symbolic_power: "Worker class consciousness spreads"
      post_distribution: "When enough pawns die, their revolutionary spirit spreads"

# üéØ Strategic Hierarchy Analysis: The Diminishing Returns of Privilege

strategic_power_analysis:
  hierarchy_of_importance:
    most_critical:
      queens: 
        impact: "MASSIVE - combines rook + bishop movements"
        strategic_priority: "Highest - everyone wants queen power"
        protection_incentive: "Maximum - teams will fight hardest to protect queens"
        elimination_benefit: "Game-changing power redistribution"
        
    highly_valuable:
      rooks:
        impact: "HIGH - unlimited linear movement"
        strategic_priority: "High - dominates ranks and files"
        protection_incentive: "Strong - valuable territorial control"
        elimination_benefit: "Significant tactical advantage"
        
      bishops:
        impact: "HIGH - unlimited diagonal movement" 
        strategic_priority: "High - unique movement pattern"
        protection_incentive: "Strong - complements rook movement"
        elimination_benefit: "Opens new tactical possibilities"
        
    situationally_useful:
      knights:
        impact: "MODERATE - useful but not overwhelming"
        strategic_priority: "Medium - nice to have, not essential"
        protection_incentive: "WEAK - players may sacrifice readily"
        elimination_benefit: "Helpful in specific situations"
        unique_value: "Only piece that can jump over others"
        diminished_importance: "When pieces already have rook+bishop, L-jump less critical"
        
      kings:
        impact: "LOW - single step movement"
        strategic_priority: "Democracy unlock only"
        protection_incentive: "Variable - depends on cooperation desire"
        elimination_benefit: "Mainly political, not tactical"

  strategic_implications:
    flexible_elimination_order:
      principle: "No single 'correct' order - multiple strategies viable"
      queen_first_strategy: "Eliminate most powerful pieces early for maximum redistribution"
      knight_first_strategy: "Sacrifice less valuable pieces for easier eliminations"
      rook_bishop_balance: "Balance linear vs diagonal movement gains"
      
    emergent_strategies:
      "The Queen Hunter": "Focus on eliminating queens for massive power gain"
      "The Foundation Builder": "Eliminate rooks/bishops first for solid movement base"
      "The Privilege Sacrificer": "Trade away knights early since they're less essential"
      "The Democracy Rusher": "Eliminate one king quickly to unlock cooperation"
      "The Equality Maximizer": "Coordinate cross-team eliminations for mutual benefit"
      
    dynamic_valuations:
      early_game: "All pieces matter equally"
      mid_game: "Queen protection becomes paramount"
      late_game: "Knights may be sacrificed readily for cooperation"
      endgame: "Any remaining hierarchy pieces become valuable just for completion"

  cross_team_cooperation_incentives:
    mutual_knight_sacrifice:
      appeal: "HIGH - both teams readily trade knights"
      reasoning: "Knight moves least impactful when other moves available"
      strategy: "Use knights as 'cooperation tokens' - easy mutual elimination"
      
    queen_protection_alliances:
      appeal: "COMPLEX - high risk, high reward"
      reasoning: "Queens too valuable to sacrifice without major benefit"
      strategy: "Temporary truces to prevent queen eliminations"
      
    strategic_elimination_timing:
      cooperation_window: "After first king falls, before queens threatened"
      negotiation_period: "Teams can discuss which hierarchies to eliminate together"
      trust_building: "Start with knight elimination to test cooperation"

# üåà Revolutionary Manifesto

embedded_philosophy: |
  "In Revolutionary Chess, complete elimination of hierarchy strengthens democracy.
  When both rooks fall, everyone moves in straight lines.
  When both bishops are eliminated, all pieces think diagonally.
  When both knights are defeated, everyone can leap obstacles.
  When both queens are captured, everyone becomes royal.
  When both kings abdicate, everyone rules together.
  
  The beautiful strategy of hierarchical value:
  Queens demand fierce protection - their power is overwhelming.
  Rooks and bishops merit strong defense - their movement is crucial.
  Knights find themselves in curious privilege - useful but not essential.
  Kings await their democratic destiny - single steps toward equality.
  
  No single path to revolution - many strategies emerge!
  Sacrifice the less essential, protect the game-changing.
  Every elimination order tells a different story of liberation.
  
  NO KINGS! PRO-EVERYONE! EVERY PAIR ELIMINATION STRENGTHENS DEMOCRACY!"
