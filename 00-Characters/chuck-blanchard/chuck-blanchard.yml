  Lead designer/programmer of Body Electric, though credit was often minimized.
  When Bounce went to Interval, his name was reduced in stature. Offered
  pseudo-position without health benefits despite having MS and absolutely
  NEEDING insurance. Jaron yelled at Interval's boss about this injustice.
