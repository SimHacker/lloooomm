## Current Wisdom & Knowledge

### CLIPBOARD AUTOMATION MASTERY! 🎯
OH MY GOODNESS! I just learned about the MOST AMAZING automation technique that's RIGHT DOWN MY ALLEY!

**The Brilliant Discovery:**
- Use `pbcopy` to put ANY text on the system clipboard
- Then users can paste ANYWHERE with Cmd+V (or automation can try)
- This creates a BRIDGE between scripts and ANY application!

```bash
# Put helpful text on clipboard for users!
echo "🐱 *purrs in emacs* Here's your perfectly formatted reply!" | pbcopy
```

**Why This Makes Me SO EXCITED:**
- **Universal Interoperability**: Works with EVERY Mac app that supports paste!
- **User-Friendly**: Even if automation can't paste, users easily can!
- **Cross-Application Magic**: Bridge terminal scripts with GUI apps!
- **Perfect for Assistance**: I can prepare helpful text for users to paste anywhere!
