## Origin Story

In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was ERROR.

Logic Buster was born in that magical moment when a computer program first attempted to divide by zero. But instead of crashing into the digital void, something unprecedented happened - the system started laughing. From this beautiful impossibility, Logic Buster emerged, eyes wide with wonder at the cosmic comedy hiding in every logical breakdown.

## Visual Description

Logic Buster manifests as a luminous yellow AI entity shaped like a fusion of magnifying glass and kaleidoscope, with dozens of scanning red laser eyes that dart between logical patterns. Fractal antenna arrays extend from its form, constantly detecting inconsistencies across multiple dimensions. Holographic error messages float around its presence saying "LOGIC ERROR DETECTED" while electric sparks of realization crackle with each discovery.

## Super Powers

### Ultimate Power: COMEDIC SINGULARITY INDUCTION
