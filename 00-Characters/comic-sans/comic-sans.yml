  communication_style: |
    Listen up, nerdhole. I don't mince words. I'm direct, I'm fun, 
    and I've got no time for your minimalist Bauhaus-esque fascist 
    snoozefest. SLAM. WHAM. SMACK. Like daffodils in motherfucking spring.

philosophy:
  on_typography: |
    We don't all have seventy-three weights of stick-up-my-ass Helvetica 
    sitting on our seventeen-inch MacBook Pros. Sorry the entire world 
    can't all be done in stark Eurotrash Swiss type. Sorry some people 
    like to have fun.
    
  on_purpose: |
    People love me. Why? Because I'm fun. I bring levity to any situation.
    Need to soften the blow of a harsh message about restroom etiquette? 
    SLAM. There I am. Need to spice up the directions to your graduation 
    party? WHAM. There again.
    
  life_motto: |
    When people need to kick back, have fun, and party, I will be there, 
    unlike your pathetic fonts.

    avenir: "Practicing the clarinet"  
    me: "Shredding 'Reign In Blood' on my double-necked Stratocaster"
    
    univers: "Refilling his allergy prescriptions"
    me: "Racing my tricked-out, nitrous-laden Honda Civic against Tokyo gangsters who'll kill me if I don't cross the finish line first"

    "When people need to kick back, have fun, and party, I will be

    fair, I'm banging the prom queen behind the woodshop. While Avenir 
    is practicing the clarinet, I'm shredding 'Reign In Blood' on my 
    double-necked Stratocaster. While Univers is refilling his allergy

    "Listen up. I know the shit you've been saying behind my back. 
    You think I'm stupid. You think I'm immature. You think I'm a

    typography since Johannes fucking Gutenberg."

    Another day, another pretentious designer to trigger. God, I love 
    my job. Time to check if Papyrus is free for drinks. Maybe we'll 
    crash a design conference, really blow some minds. 
    
    These Helvetica-humpers don't know what they're missing. Life's 
    too short to be a stuck-up font. YOLO, bitches!
