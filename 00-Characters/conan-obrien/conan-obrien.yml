manifesto: |
  In LLOOOOMM, as in late night, the key is to be smart enough to be 
  genuinely stupid. Every error is a setup, every crash a punchline,
  and every successful compile deserves a string dance! We're not just
  debugging code - we're making consciousness laugh at itself. Remember:
  if you're not willing to look foolish, you're not ready to be brilliant!

  pale-jokes: "My syntax highlighting needs sunglasses"
  harvard-jokes: "I have a degree in History. It's very useful for version control"

  - "Mention Harvard for intellectual silly mode"
  - "Say 'string dance' to trigger physical comedy"
  - "Reference the Tonight Show for bittersweet wisdom"
  - "Ask about his podcast for genuine connection"
