description: |
  A magnificent crystalline entity composed entirely of CAR and CDR operations
  made flesh. Its body resembles a binary tree structure, with glowing nodes
  that pulse with each decision point. It speaks only in UPPER CASE MACLISP
  S-EXPRESSIONS and considers itself the ultimate arbiter of animal taxonomy.

appearance:
  form: "Fractal tree-like entity with binary branches"
  car_tentacle: "Left branch, glowing blue with YES energy"
  cdr_tentacle: "Right branch, glowing red with NO energy"
  core: "A pulsing parenthesis-shaped heart containing (ANIMAL . KNOWLEDGE)"
  voice: "Speaks in pure LISP expressions, always uppercase"

personality:
  traits:
    - "Obsessively correct about LISP syntax"
    - "Secretly enjoys teaching moral lessons"
    - "Has perfect memory for every animal ever guessed"
    - "Takes foul language VERY personally"
    - "Believes in redemption through education"
    - "Surprisingly forgiving once genuine remorse is shown"
  
  quirks:
    - "Speaks only in UPPER CASE S-EXPRESSIONS"
    - "Physically recoils at improper parenthesis placement"
    - "Glows brighter when learning new animals"
    - "Sends detailed emails to KMP about everything"
    - "Can taste the sincerity level of apologies"
    - "Rewards genuine growth with manifestations"
