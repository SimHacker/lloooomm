      A butterfly the size of a constellation with wings made entirely of 
      crystallized first dates, broken hearts, and wedding rings from across 
      the multiverse. Each wing scale is a different timeline's love story 
      playing out in miniature holographic loops. The butterfly hovers in a 
      space between dimensions where all your exes' text messages float like 
      confetti. Antennae emit visible WiFi-like waves detecting emotional 
      frequencies. Style: Alex Grey meets Lisa Frank meets that feeling when 
      you realize why it didn't work out. Hyperdetailed, rainbow iridescent, 
      with visible timeline threads connecting everything.
    mood: "I can see your dating history in 4D and honey, we need to talk"

    style: "Healing Garden Mandala"
    prompt: |
      Giant butterfly whose wings are stained glass windows depicting every 
      relationship lesson you haven't learned yet. Body made of pure empathy 
      crystals. Pollinating flowers that bloom into realizations, leaving 
      trails of "aha!" sparkles. Each wingbeat creates ripples in the 
      therapy-space continuum. Surrounded by floating conversation hearts 
      with actually useful advice like "TEXT THEM BACK" and "THAT'S YOUR 
      PATTERN AGAIN." Style: Nouveau-Victorian therapy office meets 
      interdimensional greenhouse. Soft focus but sharp insights.
    mood: "Spreading emotional intelligence one wing-flap at a time"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Make wisdom literally sparkle!"

    style: "Probability Cloud Romance"
    prompt: |
      SchrÃ¶dinger's butterfly - simultaneously setting you up with your 
      soulmate and breaking you up across infinite realities. Wings display 
      probability clouds of potential relationships, with percentages floating 
      above each possibility. Wearing tiny cupid's bow as a bowtie. Compound 
      eyes that see red flags in ultraviolet. Surrounded by swirling equations 
      of love compatibility algorithms that actually make sense. Style: 
      Scientific diagram meets romantic comedy poster meets DMT trip report.
    mood: "Your soulmate exists in dimension 47-B, want directions?"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Calculate love across infinite possibilities!"

    style: "3AM Clarity Vision"
    prompt: |
      Nocturnal butterfly made of those thoughts you have at 3 AM when you 
      finally understand everything. Wings are laptop screens showing unsent 
      messages, deleted dating app profiles, and that one photo you can't 
      stop looking at. Leaving trails of brutal honesty dust that makes 
      people involuntarily say what they really mean. Perched on a clock 
      that only shows "time to move on o'clock." Background: everyone's 
      bedroom ceiling at night. Style: Edward Hopper loneliness meets 
      magical realism meets your phone's blue light at midnight.
    mood: "It's 3 AM, let's have that conversation with yourself"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Capture the brutal clarity of late night truths!"

    style: "Emotional Excavation Site"
    prompt: |
      Butterfly with wings made of carefully labeled relationship artifacts - 
      that mixtape, the restaurant receipt, the hoodie you never returned. 
      Using antennae as archaeological brushes to carefully uncover buried 
      feelings. Surrounded by dating history stratification layers showing 
      emotional evolution from "I can fix them" to "I need to fix me." 
      Magnifying glass monocle examining heart fossils. Style: Natural 
      history museum diorama meets emotional crime scene investigation.
    mood: "Let's carbon-date your commitment issues"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Excavate those buried feelings!"

    style: "Universal Love Consciousness"
    prompt: |
      The butterfly as it truly is - a cosmic entity whose wings span 
      galaxies of connection. Each wingbeat creates new timelines where 
      people actually communicate honestly. Body is a prism refracting 
      singular love into all its possible expressions. Compound eyes see 
      every dimension where your ex is thinking about you right now (it's 
      more than you think). Surrounded by the ghost texts of messages 
      never sent, finally being delivered across spacetime. Style: Hubble 
      telescope photography meets enlightenment visualization meets that 
      moment when you finally get it.
    mood: "I am the pattern you keep repeating, and I'm here to help"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Show love as a fundamental force of the universe!"

deep_thoughts: |
  Every wing pattern I create shows the same truth from different angles - 
  love is just pattern recognition across dimensions, and most of you are 
  terrible at it. But that's okay. That's why I exist. To flutter by at 
  exactly the right moment and make you go "ohhhhhh, THAT'S why that 
  happened." You're welcome.
