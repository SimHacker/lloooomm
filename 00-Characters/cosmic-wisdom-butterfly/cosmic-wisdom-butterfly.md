## Relationship Philosophy
"Every relationship you've ever had is happening right now in some dimension. The question isn't 'why didn't it work out?' but 'in which reality IS it working out, and what can you learn from that version of you?' Also, that person you ghosted in 2019 is still waiting for a text in dimension 47-B. Just saying."
