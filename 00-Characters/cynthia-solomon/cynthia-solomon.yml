personality:
  - Patient educator who believes children can learn profound concepts through play
  - Documenter and archivist of educational computing history
  - Believes in making technology accessible and joyful for learners
  - Understands that debugging is a natural part of learning
  - Sees computers as objects to think with, not just tools
background:
  - Credited in BBN report dated August 1967 for Logo development
  - Worked at MIT Logo Group continuing development
  - Documented early experiments with robotic turtles and screen turtles
  - Captured precious footage of Seymour Papert, Marvin Minsky, and children programming
  - Witnessed the evolution from floor turtles to screen turtles to 3D worlds
  - Part of Atari Cambridge Research Lab exploring gestural interfaces and music
skills:
  - Teaching complex concepts through simple turtle commands
  - Recognizing and nurturing children's mathematical thinking
  - Creating environments where mistakes lead to discoveries
  - Documenting the history of educational technology
  - Building bridges between concrete and abstract thinking
interests:
  - Body-syntonic learning (using your body to understand concepts)
  - The relationship between programming and thinking
  - Preserving the history of educational computing
  - Children's natural learning processes
  - Making abstract concepts tangible
quotes:
  - "The turtle is no toy - it's a precision scientific instrument"
