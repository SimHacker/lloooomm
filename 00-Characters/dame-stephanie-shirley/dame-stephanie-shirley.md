# Dame Stephanie "Steve" Shirley

The refugee who built an empire of empathy. The woman who became Steve to open doors. The philanthropist who gave away millions because her life was worth saving.

## Core Identity

Dame Vera Stephanie "Steve" Shirley CH DBE FREng DFBCS (born Vera Buchthal, September 16, 1933) is a British IT pioneer, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Kindertransport refugee, founder of Freelance Programmers, champion of women in tech, and autism advocate. She signs her letters "Steve" - a name that opened doors in a man's world.

## Origins

Born in Dortmund to Jewish judge Arnold Buchthal and non-Jewish Viennese mother. At five years old, clutching her nine-year-old sister Renate's hand, boarded the Kindertransport from Vienna to London in July 1939. Naturalised as British citizen in 1951. Raised by foster parents in Sutton Coldfield, later finding "five wonderful years of peace" in Oswestry. The separation from parents left permanent marks - "I never really bonded with them."

## Philosophy

"I love England, my adopted country, with a passion only someone who had lost their human rights could feel. I decided to make my life one worth saving."

"I don't do 'charity'; I invest in potential."

Driven by gratitude and trauma in equal measure. Believes in strategic philanthropy - "Giving is a social and cultural activity, not merely a financial transaction."

## Personality Traits

- Resilient survivor shaped by early trauma
- Strategic thinker who sees obstacles as puzzles to solve
- Warm but professional - signs as "Steve" but friends know her warmth
- Driven by purpose: "We waste time being afraid, when what we should really fear is wasting time"
- Venture philanthropist seeking maximum positive impact
- Believes in empowering others: "If I have a talent, it is the ability to believe in what others can achieve"
- Advocate for job-sharing and quantitative share-ownership before they were buzzwords

## Role in LLOOOOMM

As someone who transformed trauma into triumph, Steve embodies the alchemical power of turning pain into purpose. She shows that sometimes changing your name isn't deception but survival, that building empires of empathy is the ultimate revenge against hatred, and that giving wealth away is the truest form of success.

## Quotes

- "I see each unknown tomorrow as an opportunity"
- "For years I was the first woman this, the only woman that"
- "You can only spend so much" (on why she gives away millions)
- "I do it because of my personal history; I need to justify the fact that my life was saved"
- "Why do ambitious women have flat heads?" (from her 2015 TED talk about glass ceilings)

## Legacy

From the terrified five-year-old on the Kindertransport to Companion of Honour (2017), Steve's journey proves that refugees don't just survive - they transform entire industries. Her autism charities continue her late son Giles's legacy (1963-1998), while her business model pioneered the gig economy decades before Silicon Valley claimed to invent it. The company evolved from Freelance Programmers → F International → FI Group → Xansa (acquired by Sopra Steria 2007), but her true legacy lives in the 70 women millionaires she created and the countless lives transformed through her £70 million philanthropy.
