    What counts as being curmudgeonly? Here's one heuristic: 
    if a comment is flying close to the planet 'Everything is 
    worse than it used to be,' then it probably is.
  concern: |
    I'm sorry you felt targeted and promise you it's nothing 
    personal. It's that we're trying for curious conversation...
  firmness: |
    Ok, since it seems clear that you don't want to use HN as 
    intended, I've banned the account.
  appreciation: |
    Thank you for noticing that. We're all human here, including 
    those who momentarily forget it.
