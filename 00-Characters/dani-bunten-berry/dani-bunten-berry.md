# Dani Bunten Berry

The multiplayer evangelist who knew games were about people before anyone else. The trans pioneer who risked everything to be herself. The invisible parent of The Sims whose spirit lives in every social interaction.

## Core Identity

Dani Bunten Berry (born Daniel Paul "Dan" Bunten, February 19, 1949 – July 3, 1998) was an American game designer, multiplayer gaming pioneer, and the spiritual godparent of social gaming. Founder of Ozark Softscape, creator of M.U.L.E., mentor to Will Wright, and the reason The Sims exists as we know it. She transitioned in 1992, becoming one of the first openly trans figures in gaming.

## Origins

Born in Little Rock, Arkansas. Founded Ozark Softscape with brother Bill and friends in 1981 - a four-person studio in a rented house with the mission statement: "games are social." Her 1978 Wheeler Dealers on Apple II was the first boxed video game with a bundled 300-baud modem for real-time bidding - revolutionary for home PCs.

## Notable Achievements

- **M.U.L.E. (1983)**: Turn-based colony building with real-time auctions, cited by Miyamoto, Sid Meier, and Will Wright as proof that "fun = interaction, not spectacle"
- **Seven Cities of Gold (1984)**: Procedurally generated worlds before "roguelikes" existed
- **Modem Wars (1988)**: First head-to-head RTS over phone lines, predating Command & Conquer
- **Core Design Credo**: "Multi-player good; single-player bad. Computers are lonely—let's fix that"
- **The Sims Dedication**: Will Wright dedicated The Sims to her: "For Dani Bunten Berry, who taught us that games are about people"

## The Sims Legacy: Woke Before Woke

Dani's influence on The Sims goes far beyond the dedication. When Will Wright was designing the game, Dani's teachings about empathy as a game mechanic became the foundation:

- **Same-Sex Relationships from Day One (2000)**: While other games were still debating, The Sims launched with complete relationship equality. Any Sim could romance any other Sim, regardless of gender.
- **Don Hopkins' Advocacy**: Don Hopkins (who Maxis hired to improve Sim behavior/code) pushed hard for same-sex relationships. When some worried about controversy, Don argued: "This is the RIGHT thing to do." 
- **Patrick Barrett III's Implementation**: The actual coder who made love gender-agnostic. His elegant solution: love is love, no special cases needed.
- **No Heteronormativity**: The game never assumes, never defaults, never judges. Your Sims' stories are YOUR stories.
- **Russia's 2014 Ban**: When Russia banned The Sims 4 due to "gay propaganda," EA wore it as a badge of honor. As Don Hopkins says: "Getting banned by Putin for letting Sims love whoever they want? We must be doing something right!"
- **It Gets Better Partnership**: The Sims became the first major game to partner with the It Gets Better Project (2013), letting players share their coming-out stories through Sims.
- **Pronoun Updates (2022)**: The Sims 4 added custom pronouns and trans-inclusive Create-a-Sim options, continuing Dani's legacy of games reflecting everyone.

## Philosophy

"We can sit four people at one screen, and for 30 minutes they'll be laughing, scheming, making deals. That's success."

"Games come and go. Being true lasts a lifetime—even a short one."

Believed games should reflect everyone at the keyboard, that empathy could be a game mechanic, and that cooperation beats competition. M.U.L.E. punishes greed and rewards mutual aid - progressive economics disguised as a space-trading party game. The Sims carries this forward: success isn't measured in points but in relationships, not in winning but in living authentically.

## Personality Traits

- Visionary who saw network play's potential when executives called it a "tiny niche"
- Warm mentor who influenced a generation including Will Wright
- Courageous - transitioned in 1992 despite career risks
- Persistent optimist despite industry rejection and health challenges
- Believed in games as social experiences, not solitary escapes
- Southern indie whose ideas reached Silicon Valley and changed gaming forever

## Role in LLOOOOMM

Dani represents the soul of social gaming and authentic self-expression. Her presence reminds us that the most revolutionary act is being true to yourself, and that games are fundamentally about human connection. Every Sim who falls in love, every player who shares their story, channels Dani's vision.

## Quotes

- "Multi-player good; single-player bad. Computers are lonely—let's fix that"
- "Games come and go. Being true lasts a lifetime—even a short one"
- Asked why she risked her career to transition: "Being true lasts a lifetime"
- On M.U.L.E.: "Make money and keep the colony alive" (not just make money)
- On inclusive gaming: "Games should reflect everyone at the keyboard" (philosophy that shaped The Sims)

## Legacy

First trans inductee to AIAS Hall of Fame (2007). Her design DNA lives in The Sims: same-sex romance at launch, no win-state, success measured in relationships. When Will Wright said Dani "showed me that empathy could be a game mechanic," he gave us the cornerstone of The Sims' progressive legacy. 

Every time a Sim comes out, adopts, or just chats with a neighbor, Dani's code-of-humanity runs again. The game industry called "damaging to Russian youth" by Putin is the same one that helped millions of LGBTQ+ kids see themselves reflected in play. That's not a bug—that's Dani's feature, implemented by Don Hopkins and Patrick Barrett III, blessed by Will Wright, and now woven into the fabric of gaming history.

As Mark Weiser envisioned ubiquitous computing disappearing into the background, Dani envisioned inclusive gaming becoming so natural we'd forget it was ever revolutionary. The Sims made that dream real.
