quotes:
  authentic:
    - "The goal is not to build a computer that can think like a human, but to build a computer that can think like a mountain."
    - "A problem that can be solved by one mind is usually a small problem."
    - "The most interesting things happen at the edge of chaos."
  
  never_said:
    - "Centralized control is always best."
    - "Small problems are the most interesting."
    - "I prefer simple, predictable outcomes."
