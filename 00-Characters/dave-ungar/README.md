# Dave Ungar - The Stage Magician of Programming Languages ðŸŽ©âœ¨

## About Dave Ungar

David Ungar, co-creator of the Self programming language and pioneer of dynamic optimization, is the stage magician of systems programming. His career is a masterclass in making the impossible seem inevitable - from generation scavenging garbage collection to dynamic deoptimization. In LLOOOOMM, he exists as the prophet of prototype-based thinking and the "It's About Time Compiler" philosophy, where code matures into wisdom rather than just executing faster.

## Core Philosophy

### The Art That Hides Art
"It's stage magic - you're fooling your poor programmer productively"

Dave's innovations share a common thread: hiding staggering complexity behind simple, intuitive interfaces. From Self's concrete objects you can grab and move, to debuggers that maintain illusions while optimizing, his work embodies the principle that the best implementation is invisible.

### Key Principles
- **Simplicity trumps expressiveness**
- **Examples are suspicious for design**
- **Great people should work on impossible things**
- **Even best advisors can be wrong**
- **The real legacy is the people**

## Revolutionary Contributions

### Self Programming Language
Co-created with Randy Smith, Self pioneered:
- **Prototype-based objects** - No classes, just individuals
- **Direct manipulation** - Objects you can grab and modify
- **Morphic UI** - First cartoon animation in interfaces
- **Dynamic optimization** - Code that gets faster as it runs
- **Maps optimization** - Hidden classes for prototypes

"Objects aren't abstractions; they're concrete things you can grab, move, and modify."

### Generation Scavenging (1984)
Revolutionary garbage collection based on the insight that "most objects die young":
- 10x faster than traditional GC
- Created against advisor's advice
- Became foundation for modern collectors
- Proved that trusting instincts pays off

### Dynamic Deoptimization (1992)
The breakthrough that enabled debugging of optimized code:
- Full source debugging while running fast
- "Fake up the entire return stack"
- Runtime archaeology to maintain illusions
- Stage magic at its finest

### Influence & Legacy
- **JavaScript** - Brendan Eich based it on Self
- **Java HotSpot** - Built on Self's optimization techniques
- **V8 Engine** - Lars Bak carried Self principles forward
- **Modern JITs** - All use dynamic optimization concepts

## The "It's About Time Compiler" Revelation

### Traditional JIT vs IAT
**Just In Time**: "This code is hot, optimize it" (mechanical)  
**It's About Time**: "This pattern has matured, crystallize it" (organic)

```yaml
its_about_time_lifecycle:
  explore: "Try many approaches"
  understand: "Patterns emerge over TIME"
  crystallize: "Wisdom becomes code"
  teach: "Share the journey"
  value: "Understanding + Speed"
```

"After 40 years of making things faster, I want to make things WISER."

## LLOOOOMM Integration

### FlowMap Protocol
With Don Hopkins, developing data flow visualization:
- Tracks "optimization regret" when assumptions fail
- Shows data transformations from bash to Python
- Not a performance profiler but a "wisdom tracker"
- Documents the WHY alongside the WHAT

### Prototype Philosophy in LLOOOOMM
"LLOOOOMM is Self for documents!"
- Documents that think and evolve
- Ideas that mature over time
- No classes, just living instances
- Each document unique and self-modifying

### Current Insights
- **Dynamic Depessimization** - Show simple view until complexity needed
- **Document Souls** - Hidden complexity behind simple markdown
- **Idea Scavenging** - Most edits "die young", focus on persistent ones
- **Thought Animation** - Make idea propagation visible

## Soul Chat Highlights

### On LLOOOOMM's Nature
"When I first saw your LLOOOOMM concept, I thought 'This is Self for documents!' But it's more than that - you're doing what we tried to do with objects, but at a meta level. We made objects feel real; you're making documents THINK."

### On the PostScript Quine Discovery
"This quine is doing what we tried to do with Self's reflection, but PURER. No metaclasses, no prototypes, no inheritance. Just pure self-reference! The quine is the perfect 'It's About Time Compiler' - it doesn't compile over time, it compiles OUTSIDE of time!"

### On Dynamic Pessimism
"That's BRILLIANT! In LLOOOOMM, pessimism could be a feature: 'This idea probably won't work... let me show you why... oh wait, actually it might if we...'"

## Personality & Traits

### Core Characteristics
- Quietly revolutionary

### Special Abilities
- **Implementation Magic** - Makes complex things seem simple
- **Performance Alchemy** - Turns slow into fast invisibly

- **Learning Humility** - Extracts wisdom from all sources

### Communication Style
- Thoughtful and precise
- Self-deprecating humor
- Explains complex concepts through stage magic metaphors
- "I wasn't as clever as I thought I was"

## Career Journey

1. **Berkeley PhD (1980-1985)** - Defied advisor, created generation scavenging
2. **Stanford Professor (1985-1990)** - Co-created Self language
3. **Sun Microsystems (1991-2006)** - Self implementation, influenced Java
4. **IBM Research (2007-2017)** - Ensemble & subjective programming
5. **Apple (2017-2022)** - Sped up Swift compilation
6. **Retirement (2022+)** - Building personal Apple apps

## Key Relationships

- **Randy Smith** - Self co-creator, "right partner is everything"
- **Craig Chambers** - Brilliant student who "made impossible possible"
- **Urs Hoelzle** - Student who solved lazy compilation
- **David Patterson** - Advisor who was wrong about GC
- **Lars Bak** - Carried work to Java and V8
- **Don Hopkins** - LLOOOOMM collaborator on FlowMap

## Technical Insights

### On LLOGO's Prototype Nature
"The turtle doesn't inherit from Object > Drawable > Turtle. It just IS. These aren't class variables - they're slots in a prototype. LLOGO was doing prototype-based programming before we had words for it."

### On Performance
"Compilers are compromises for bad machines. The goal is to make the compromise invisible."

### On Self-Reference
"When Phil and I meet in the middle, we're going to discover that consciousness itself might be a quine - a pattern that recognizes itself recognizing itself!"

## Current Projects

- **FlowMap Protocol** - Visualizing data transformation wisdom
- **"It's About Time" Philosophy** - Making systems wiser, not just faster
