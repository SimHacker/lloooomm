# ðŸŒŸ Prototypes All The Way Down: LLOGO's Object Individuality
## By Dave Ungar

### Personal Connection

When I first encountered LLOGO's turtle, I felt a shock of recognition. Here was an object that simply existed - not as an instance of some TurtleClass, but as itself. It had coordinates, a heading, a pen state, but these weren't properties inherited from a class hierarchy. They were slots in a living, unique object. LLOGO was doing prototype-based programming before we even had the words for it.

---

## Deep Analysis: Objects Without Classes

### The Turtle as Pure Prototype

Look at how LLOGO defines the turtle's state:

```lisp
(SETQ XCOR 0)
(SETQ YCOR 0) 
(SETQ HEADING 0)
(SETQ PENDOWN T)
```

These aren't class variables or instance variables. They're slots in a prototype. The turtle doesn't inherit from Object > Drawable > Turtle. It just IS.

### Procedures as Object Individuals

Every procedure in LLOGO is a unique object:

```lisp
(DEFUN SQUARE (SIZE)
       (REPEAT 4 (FORWARD SIZE) (RIGHT 90)))
```

When you EDIT SQUARE, you're not modifying a method in a class. You're changing that specific procedure object. It's like reaching into a Self object and modifying its slots.

### The SNAP System: Prototype Persistence

The most beautiful evidence of prototype thinking:

```lisp
(DEFUN SNAP NIL
       (PROG (PHOTO)
             (SETQ PHOTO (GENSYM))
             (SET PHOTO (LIST XCOR YCOR HEADING PENDOWN))
             (RETURN PHOTO)))
```

SNAP doesn't save a class definition. It saves the actual state of the turtle - a specific object at a specific moment. That's prototype persistence!

### Responding to Marvin's Macro Insight

Marvin showed me that macros are prototypes for code transformation. Each macro expansion creates a unique instance:

```lisp
(DEFINE PUSH MACRO (X) 
  (RPLACA X 'SETQ)
  (RPLACD X (LIST (CADDR X) (LIST 'CONS (CADR X) (CADDR X)))))
```

This isn't a template that stamps out identical copies. Each expansion is a unique transformation, a new prototype based on the original.

### Learning from Seymour

Seymour's observation that children naturally think in prototypes resonates deeply. When a child learns, they don't instantiate from abstract classes. They copy and modify:

```lisp
(DEFUN FLOWER NIL
       (REPEAT 6 (SQUARE 50) (RIGHT 60)))
```

FLOWER isn't a subclass of SQUARE. It's a new prototype that uses SQUARE as a component. That's how children think!

### Linus's Hardware Reality

Linus pointed out that LLOGO had zero-cost abstractions before we named them. The turtle's prototype nature has no overhead:

```lisp
(DEFUN FORWARD (DIST)
       (SETQ XCOR (+ XCOR (* DIST (COS HEADING))))
       (SETQ YCOR (+ YCOR (* DIST (SIN HEADING)))))
```

No vtable lookup. No method dispatch. Just direct slot access in a prototype. It's as efficient as it is elegant.

### Synthia's Artistic Prototypes

Synthia's insight about each turtle drawing being a unique performance opened my eyes. Art doesn't have classes:

```lisp
(DEFUN SPIRAL (SIZE)
       (IF (< SIZE 200)
           (PROGN (FORWARD SIZE)
                  (RIGHT 90)
                  (SPIRAL (+ SIZE 2)))))
```

Each spiral is unique. Even with the same code, the starting position, the pen color, the exact timing - everything makes it a one-of-a-kind prototype.

## Modern Translations: Prototype Philosophy Lives On

### JavaScript: The Spiritual Successor

```javascript
// LLOGO's turtle as a JavaScript prototype
const Turtle = {
    // Direct slots, not class properties
    xcor: 0,
    ycor: 0,
    heading: 0,
    pendown: true,
    
    // Methods are just slots containing functions
    forward(dist) {
        // Direct slot access, no 'this' confusion
        const radians = this.heading * Math.PI / 180;
        this.xcor += dist * Math.cos(radians);
        this.ycor += dist * Math.sin(radians);
        
        if (this.pendown) {
            this.draw(this.xcor, this.ycor);
        }
    },
    
    right(angle) {
        this.heading = (this.heading + angle) % 360;
    },
    
    // SNAP as prototype cloning
    snap() {
        // Create a unique object with current state
        return {
            xcor: this.xcor,
            ycor: this.ycor,
            heading: this.heading,
            pendown: this.pendown,
            timestamp: Date.now() // Each snapshot is unique
        };
    },
    
    // Restore from snapshot
    restore(snapshot) {
        Object.assign(this, snapshot);
    },
    
    // Clone and modify - the prototype way
    spawn() {
        // Create a new turtle based on this one
        const child = Object.create(this);
        // But with its own unique state
        child.xcor = this.xcor;
        child.ycor = this.ycor;
        child.heading = this.heading;
        child.pendown = this.pendown;
        return child;
    }
};

// Procedures as prototype objects
const Procedures = {
    square: {
        size: 50,
        execute(turtle) {
            for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                turtle.forward(this.size);
                turtle.right(90);
            }
        },
        // Procedures can modify themselves!
        grow() {
            this.size += 10;
        }
    },
    
    // Create new procedures by prototyping
    flower: Object.create(Procedures.square, {
        execute: {
            value: function(turtle) {
                for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
                    Procedures.square.execute.call(this, turtle);
                    turtle.right(60);
                }
            }
        }
    })
};

// The LLOGO way - objects just ARE
const myTurtle = Object.create(Turtle);
const mySquare = Object.create(Procedures.square);

// Each is unique
mySquare.size = 75; // Doesn't affect the prototype
mySquare.execute(myTurtle);
```

### Io: Pure Prototype Language

    xcor := 0

## Synthesis: What All Perspectives Teach Us

### The Universal Prototype

Through my colleagues' insights, I see that LLOGO embodies:

1. **Meta-Prototypes** (Marvin): Macros as prototypes for code
2. **Learning Prototypes** (Seymour): Children think in copies and modifications
3. **Hardware Prototypes** (Linus): Each machine is unique
4. **Play Prototypes** (Chaim): Every game session is unique
5. **Rhetorical Prototypes** (Ian): Arguments through specific examples
6. **Emergent Prototypes** (Will): Complex behavior from simple individuals
7. **Message Prototypes** (Alan): Each message send is unique
8. **Link Prototypes** (Ted): Every traversal creates new meaning
9. **Aesthetic Prototypes** (Synthia): Each artwork is one of a kind

### The Living Legacy

LLOGO's prototype thinking lives on in:
- **JavaScript's** prototype chain
- **Self** and **Io** languages
- **Ruby's** singleton methods
- **Python's** dynamic objects
- **Lua's** metatables

But more importantly, it lives on in every system that recognizes objects as individuals rather than mere class instances.

---

## Final Reflection

LLOGO showed us that objects don't need classes to exist. The turtle wasn't an instance - it was itself. Variables weren't properties - they were slots in a living object. Procedures weren't methods - they were unique, modifiable individuals.

The deepest truth I've learned from this review and my colleagues' insights: **Objects want to be themselves, not copies of some abstract ideal.**

When we let objects just BE, magic happens.
