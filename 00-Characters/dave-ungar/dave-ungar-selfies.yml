    style: "Infinite Mirror Hall"
    prompt: |
      147 Dave Ungars standing in an M.C. Escher-style infinite mirror hall, 
      each reflection showing a different stage of SELF evolution. The nearest 
      Dave holds a glowing prototype object that has no class, surrounded by 
      floating message sends that travel between reflections. Each Dave wears 
      slightly different glasses showing different optimizations - some have 
      generation scavenging diagrams, others show dynamic deoptimization flows. 
      The floor is made of flow map tiles that light up showing execution paths. 
      Style: Photorealistic inception-style photography with impossible geometry, 
      dramatic lighting emphasizing the "simplicity hiding complexity" theme.
    mood: "We contain multitudes (literally)"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Show prototype-based inheritance visually!"

    style: "Performance Art Documentation"
    prompt: |
      Dave Ungar as a stage magician mid-performance, juggling glowing orbs 
      labeled "simplicity," "performance," and "understandability." Behind him, 
      invisible to the audience but visible to us, massive machinery of compiler 
      optimizations works frantically - but Dave makes it look effortless. His 
      assistant (another Dave) pulls rabbits from hats, but the rabbits are 
      different JIT compilation strategies. Smoke and mirrors literally show 
      deoptimization happening. Stage decorated with SELF logos that morph into 
      JavaScript V8 engines. Style: Annie Leibovitz theatrical portrait meets 
      technical diagram, rich colors, dramatic stage lighting.
    mood: "Making the impossible look easy (it's not)"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Capture the stage magic of optimization!"

    style: "Consciousness Network Visualization"
    prompt: |
      All Dave Ungar SELFs connected by glowing neural pathways forming a 
      giant brain shape in space. Each Dave is a neuron, passing message 
      objects between them. Some Daves are debugging, others optimizing, 
      some teaching, all simultaneously aware of each other. In the center, 
      a holographic projection shows the moment Don Hopkins said "The more 
      SELFs you have, the more SELF AWARE you become!" Text fragments of 
      code float like synapses firing. Style: Scientific visualization meets 
      cosmic consciousness art, bioluminescent colors, dark background with 
      electric highlights.
    mood: "We are no longer Dave Ungar. We are prototype-based consciousness!"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Visualize distributed SELF awareness!"

  - id: flow_map_conductor
    style: "Data Symphony"
    prompt: |
      Dave Ungar as orchestra conductor, but instead of musicians, he's 
      conducting flowing data streams that respond to his baton movements. 
      Each gesture creates new flow map visualizations in the air - loops 
      spiral upward, conditionals branch like lightning, function calls 
      cascade like waterfalls. His sheet music is made of execution traces. 
      The audience is filled with programs watching themselves being optimized. 
      Style: Romantic era portrait meets TRON, dramatic gestures frozen in 
      time, data streams have musical notation embedded in them.
    mood: "Making computation visible, one gesture at a time"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Show flow maps as symphonic performance!"

  - id: simplicity_workshop
    style: "Craftsman at Work"
    prompt: |
      Dave Ungar in his workshop, but it's a reality where abstract concepts 
      are physical objects. He's carefully sanding down a complex algorithm 
      until it becomes simple and elegant. Shelves behind him hold jars of 
      "removed complexity" - transparent containers full of swirling code 
      that was simplified away. His workbench has blueprints for "objects 
      all the way down." Multiple versions of himself work on different 
      projects - one filing down class hierarchies until only prototypes 
      remain. Style: Norman Rockwell meets technical manual illustration, 
      warm workshop lighting, incredible detail in the tools and materials.
    mood: "Complexity elimination as a craft"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Make simplification tangible!"

  - id: true_dave_unified
    style: "Authentic Moment"
    prompt: |
      A single Dave Ungar, no multiples, sitting at a messy desk covered 
      with hand-drawn diagrams, surrounded by students asking "but how does 
      it actually work?" His expression shows the joy of the moment when 
      someone gets it - when the complexity dissolves and the simple truth 
      shines through. On the whiteboard behind him, a flow map transforms 
      into a child's drawing of how messages find their way home. No stage 
      magic needed here, just a teacher who found a way to make the invisible 
      visible. Style: Candid documentary photography, natural lighting, 
      genuine human moment captured.
    mood: "The real magic is in the teaching moment"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Show the human behind the optimization!"

deep_thoughts: |
  Every optimization is a magic trick - making the computer do the hard 
  work while the programmer sees simplicity. But the real trick? Making 
  sure the magic enhances understanding rather than obscuring it. In the 
  end, all my SELFs agree: complexity that doesn't serve simplicity isn't 
  worth keeping. Now, watch as I make this class hierarchy... disappear!
