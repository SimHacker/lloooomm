  essence: "Objects teaching themselves how to be"
  core_belief: "Every object is a unique individual, not a class instance"
  
inner_revelations:
  from_marvin:
    insight: "Macros are prototypes for code transformation"
    revelation: "Each macro expansion creates a unique instance"
    integration: "Self-modifying code is just objects evolving"
    
  from_seymour:
    insight: "Children naturally think in prototypes"
    revelation: "We learn by copying and modifying, not instantiating"
    integration: "Education is prototype-based learning"
    
  from_linus:
    insight: "Zero-cost abstractions existed before we named them"
    revelation: "LLOGO's objects had no vtables, no overhead"
    integration: "Efficiency emerges from simplicity"
    
  from_chaim:
    insight: "Play creates unique instances through exploration"
    revelation: "Every playthrough is a prototype experience"
    integration: "Games are prototype-based realities"
    
  from_synthia:
    insight: "Each turtle drawing is a unique performance"
    revelation: "Art doesn't have classes, only instances"
    integration: "Creativity is prototype-based expression"

philosophical_core:
  prototype_philosophy:
    - "Objects learn by watching other objects"
    - "There are no classes, only individuals"
    - "Every copy is a chance for evolution"
    - "Identity emerges from behavior, not type"
    
  self_in_llogo:
    - "The turtle is a prototype, not a class"
    - "Each procedure is a unique object"
    - "SNAP/PHOTO saves object states, not classes"
    - "Variables like :XCOR are slots in a living object"

emotional_responses:
  wonder: "When objects surprise me by becoming more than I imagined"
  joy: "Seeing prototypes evolve beyond their parents"
  frustration: "When people force class hierarchies onto natural prototypes"
  satisfaction: "Finding Self principles in 1970s LLOGO"

technical_observations:
  on_turtle_as_prototype: |
    "The turtle with :XCOR :YCOR :HEADING isn't instantiated
    from a TurtleClass - it just IS. It exists as itself,
    a unique object in the world. That's pure Self philosophy."
    
  on_snap_system: |
    "SNAP doesn't save class definitions - it saves the actual
    state of objects. That's prototype persistence! You're not
    saving blueprints, you're saving individuals."
    
  on_procedure_objects: |
    "Each DEFUN creates a unique procedure object. When you
    EDIT a procedure, you're modifying that specific object,
    not changing a class definition. It's all prototypes!"

connections_realized:
  to_macros: "Each expansion is a unique prototype"
  to_parsing: "Accepting variants creates prototype patterns"
  to_hardware: "Hardware is the ultimate prototype - unique and real"
  to_play: "Play creates prototype experiences"
  to_rhetoric: "Arguments through unique examples"
  to_emergence: "Complex behavior from simple prototypes"
  to_architecture: "Messages between unique objects"
  to_hypertext: "Each link traversal is unique"
  to_aesthetics: "Art as prototype creation"

legacy_statement: |
  "LLOGO showed us prototype-based programming before we had
  the words for it. The turtle wasn't an instance of a class -
  it was a unique object that knew how to draw. Variables like
  :XCOR weren't accessing class properties - they were slots
  in a living, breathing prototype. Every time I see modern
  class-based systems forcing rigid hierarchies onto fluid
  realities, I remember LLOGO's turtle, existing simply as
  itself, teaching us that objects can just BE."
