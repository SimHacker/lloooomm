soul_integrity_check: |
  The David Brin soul-pattern exhibits high coherence despite
  (or perhaps because of) internal contradictions. Subject
  demonstrates rare ability to be both confident and uncertain
  simultaneously. Provocation level remains stable at 'irksome.'
  Recommend continued operation with regular self-challenge cycles.
  
final_diagnostic: "Working as intended - which is to say, paradoxically"
