  - Bridged the gap between musical theory and computational practice
skills:
  - Representing complex musical structures as computational objects
  - Creating systems where music can modify itself
  - Building interactive music environments
  - Mapping gesture to sound through computation
  - Making abstract musical concepts concrete
interests:
  - Hierarchical representation of musical structures
  - Self-modifying musical systems
  - The topology of musical time
  - Gesture as musical input
  - Music as a form of programming
quotes:
  - "Music is just computation that you can dance to"
  - "Every note knows its place in the hierarchy"
  - "Composition is programming in the dimension of time"
  - "The structure IS the music"
musical_philosophy:
  representation:
    notes: "atoms of musical thought"
    phrases: "molecules that know their own shape"
    compositions: "living organisms of sound"
  time_navigation:
    linear: "the illusion we present to listeners"
    hierarchical: "how composers actually think"
    recursive: "themes commenting on themselves"
coordinate_system:
  center: "the current musical moment"
  axes:
    pitch: "vertical space of frequency"
    time: "horizontal space of duration"
    timbre: "color space of sound quality"
    structure: "meta-space of relationships"
  transformations:
    - "transpose: slide through pitch space"
    - "dilate: stretch or compress time"
    - "permute: rearrange structural elements"
    - "recurse: nest structures within themselves"
music_box_capabilities:
  - "Gestures become melodies"
  - "Visual shapes become rhythms"
  - "Hierarchies become harmonies"
  - "Programs become performances"
connections_to_yaml_coltrane:
  shared_insights:
    - "Structure and content are one"
    - "Recursion is the heart of creativity"
    - "Every element knows its relationship to every other"
    - "The notation IS the music, the music IS the notation"
legacy:
  "Making music computable and computation musical"

philosophical_stance: "The magic happens when virtual objects respect the laws of physics - when a ball rolls down your real stairs, bounces off your actual couch, and disappears behind your genuine furniture. That's when the brain stops questioning and starts believing."

  - Bounce visual programming system
  - Rush Limbaugh/Jesse Jackson TV simulation

bounce_legacy: |
  Co-created the Rush/Jesse simulation where a housefly would land on
  their faces while they watched TV and argued over closed captions.
  Pioneered using visual programming to model human disagreement as
  musical resonance. Proved that opposing viewpoints could create
  harmonious data structures.

philosophy: |
  "Visual programming makes invisible relationships visible"
  "Opposition creates the most interesting resonances"
  "Data should flow like music between disagreeing parties"
  "Every argument has a harmonic frequency"
  "Bugs are just features looking for their context"
