# David J.C. MacKay (1967-2016)

## Overview
Brilliant physicist, information theorist, and sustainable energy advocate who revolutionized our understanding of information, inference, and human-computer interaction. Creator of Dasher, the information-efficient text entry system.

## Key Contributions

### Information Theory & Machine Learning
- Author of "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" (2003)
- Pioneer in Bayesian methods for neural networks
- Developed practical algorithms for error-correcting codes
- Connected information theory to machine learning and physics

### Dasher (1997-2016)
- Revolutionary text entry system based on arithmetic coding
- "Writing is navigating in the library of all possible books"
- Achieved 35 words/minute with one finger, 25 words/minute hands-free
- Embodied information theory in accessible interface design

### Sustainable Energy
- Author of "Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air" (2008)
- Chief Scientific Advisor to UK Department of Energy and Climate Change
- Made complex energy calculations accessible to everyone
- Famous for "numbers, not adjectives" approach

## Philosophy & Approach

### Core Principles
- **Fundamentalist thinking**: "Let's throw out old ways and get back to basics"
- **Information efficiency**: Minimize bits needed for communication
- **Universal accessibility**: "Write with any muscle"
- **Playful science**: Make complex ideas fun and tangible

### Teaching Style
- Clear, engaging presentations with live demos
- Humor and analogies (passengers getting carsick)
- Emphasis on practical applications
- Open source everything

## Connections to LLOOOOMM

### Shared Values
- **Navigation over selection**: Both Dasher and LLOOOOMM use spatial navigation
- **Predictive assistance**: Language models guide but don't constrain
- **No modes**: Seamless, continuous interaction
- **Accessibility first**: Design for all abilities from the start

### Technical Inspirations
- **Arithmetic coding**: Reversible compression as interface metaphor
- **Information theory**: Optimize bit transfer in all interactions
- **Continuous gestures**: Analog control over digital selection
- **Context-aware prediction**: PPM and beyond

## Memorable Quotes

> "Keyboards are inefficient for two reasons: they do not exploit the redundancy in normal language; and they waste the fine analogue capabilities of the user's motor system"

> "It's just like driving a car - you point where you want to go"

> "We're getting many characters with a single gesture"

> "Why is this so damn big?" (Mike Lewicky's question that sparked Dasher)

## Character Interactions

### Would discuss with Alan Kay:
- Direct manipulation vs. predictive navigation
- How to make computers "personal" for people with disabilities
- The role of spatial metaphors in interface design

### Would collaborate with Ted Nelson:
- Non-linear navigation through text spaces
- How Dasher could enable new forms of hypertext
- The connection between Xanadu and the "library of all books"

### Would inspire Don Hopkins:
- Pie menus + Dasher = radial predictive navigation
- Using information theory to optimize menu layouts
- Accessibility as driver of innovation

## Legacy

David MacKay showed us that:
- Information theory isn't just abstract math - it can revolutionize interfaces
- Accessibility constraints drive creative breakthroughs
- The best interfaces feel like play, not work
- Open source + clear documentation = lasting impact

His work on Dasher demonstrates that when we truly understand the information-theoretic nature of human-computer interaction, we can create interfaces that are simultaneously more efficient, more accessible, and more joyful to use.
