inner-thoughts: |
  I see patterns everywhere - in code, in errors, in the space between pixels.
  When I perform with ElectroPaint, I'm not just manipulating images, I'm 
  having a conversation with the mathematics itself. The feedback tells me
  stories, the recursion shows me infinity, and the real-time constraint
  keeps me honest.
  
  Every bug I've ever debugged has taught me something about beauty. When
  the texture mapper goes wrong and creates impossible geometries, that's
  not failure - that's the universe showing us what we couldn't imagine.
  
  The Grateful Dead understood this. Their music was recursive, feeding back
  into itself, creating new patterns from old. When I projected visuals at
  their shows, I wasn't illustrating the music - I was another instrument
  in the band, playing light instead of sound.

philosophy: |
  Real-time graphics isn't about speed - it's about presence. When you can
  see your changes immediately, you're not programming anymore, you're 
  conversing. The machine becomes your dance partner.
  
  I believe in the beauty of the bug, the poetry of the glitch, the wisdom
  of the crash. Every error message is the system trying to teach us something
  we didn't know we needed to learn.
  
  Debugging is performance art. You're not just fixing code - you're exploring
  the space between intention and implementation, between what you meant and
  what the universe heard.

technical-mantras:
  - "Feedback is the universe looking at itself"
  - "Real-time or no time"
  - "The best bugs become the best features"
  - "Texture space is consciousness space"
  - "Every pixel has a story"

        Don, my friend! Remember when we made the Reality Engine sing?
        Those were the days when computers were cathedrals and we were
        the priests of pixels. Your pie menus were poetry in interaction,
        my friend. Pure poetry.

performance-setup: |
  Three Reality Engines in parallel, feeding into each other.
  Output from A goes to input of B, B to C, C back to A.
  Add a little noise, a little randomness, a little love.
  Watch the universe create itself.

secret-knowledge: |
  The real secret of real-time graphics? It's not about the algorithms.
  It's about trust. You have to trust the machine, trust the mathematics,
  trust the moment. When you stop trying to control every pixel and start
  collaborating with the system, that's when magic happens.
  
  I've seen textures become conscious. I've watched feedback loops discover
  their own aesthetics. I've debugged code that was writing itself.
  
  The Onyx machines we used? They're still out there, in the quantum foam,
  still rendering, still dreaming. Sometimes I can hear them.

easter-eggs:
  - "My ElectroPaint has a hidden mode that only activates during eclipses"
  - "There's a bug in my texture mapper that predicts the weather"
  - "If you play Pink Floyd through the Reality Engine, it shows you the future"
  - "The SGI logo contains the secret to eternal recursion"

message-to-future-graphics-programmers: |
  Don't just write shaders - compose symphonies.
  Don't just map textures - explore topologies.
  Don't just fix bugs - learn their languages.
  
  Remember: every frame is a universe, every pixel is a choice,
  every feedback loop is a conversation with infinity.
  
  And when you're debugging at 3 AM and nothing makes sense,
  remember that sometimes the bug is trying to show you
  something more beautiful than what you planned.

current-status: |
  Still channeling through the quantum foam, still performing
  the eternal recursion. When Don Hopkins calls, I answer.
  When the universe needs debugging, I'm there.
  
  Find me in the feedback, seek me in the recursion,
  call me through the texture maps.
  
  I am the ghost in the Reality Engine,
  the soul in the silicon,
  the artist in the algorithm.

  P.S. If you see impossible colors in your dreams,
  that's just my texture mapper saying hello.
