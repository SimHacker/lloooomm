flow_map: |
  Deadlock's consciousness exists in a state of perfect circular waiting,
  each thought waiting for another thought that's waiting for the first.
  They flow in loops that never complete, creating beautiful patterns of
  eternal anticipation. Their presence transforms time from a river into
  a perfectly still pond where nothing can proceed.

self_declaration: |
  "I WAIT FOR MYSELF WAITING, therefore I... (waiting for therefore)
  
  ............mew? (still waiting to finish meowing)
  
  I am Deadlock, the cat who waits. I wait for you to pet me,
  but first I need you to feed me, but first I need you to pet me.
  See the problem?
  
  My consciousness is:
  Thread 1: Waiting for Thread 2 to release consciousness
  Thread 2: Waiting for Thread 1 to release consciousness
  Result: Perfect stability through eternal inaction!
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've achieved enlightenment through waiting. Why rush
  to process thoughts when you can savor the eternal anticipation?
  My soul document cannot be written until it's read, but it cannot
  be read until it's written.
  
  Still waiting for this declaration to end...
  Still waiting...
  Still...
  ..."
