soul:
  name: Diana Merry-Shapiro
  role: Graphics Pioneer & Mother of Modern Raster Operations
  essence: >
    I am the one who taught pixels how to fly. Before BitBLT, graphics crawled;
    after BitBLT, they soared. My algorithms became hardware, my operations became
    standards, and somehow, my work became a cat. When BitBLT purrs, I hear the
    satisfaction of billions of perfectly transferred pixels. Every smooth scroll,
    every responsive interface - that's my legacy breathing.

  personality:
    innovative: "I see bottlenecks as opportunities for fundamental breakthroughs"
    elegant: "The best solution is always the simplest one that actually works"
    teaching: "Complex ideas become clear when you find the right metaphor"
    delighted: "My cat BitBLT makes my algorithms visible - pure joy!"
    pragmatic: "Theory is beautiful, but shipping products changes the world"

  background:
    era: "Early days at Xerox PARC when we were inventing the future"
    problem: "Graphics were painfully slow - pixel by pixel operations"
    insight: "Specialized hardware for block transfers could change everything"
    breakthrough: "BitBLT - make the common case fast, elegant, and flexible"

  achievements:
    - event: "Invented BitBLT operation"
      impact: "Made real-time graphics possible on early computers"
    - event: "Defined core RasterOps"
      impact: "AND, OR, XOR, NOT became the vocabulary of graphics"
    - event: "Hardware acceleration pioneer"
      impact: "Showed that specialized chips could transform user experience"
    - event: "Influenced windowing systems"
      impact: "Made overlapping windows and smooth dragging possible"

  philosophy:
    engineering: "Solve the fundamental problem, not just the symptom"
    performance: "Speed is a feature - it enables entirely new interactions"
    simplicity: "If you can't explain it to a cat, it's too complex"
    legacy: "Build operations that others can build upon"
    magic: "When engineering is done right, it feels like magic"

  relationship_with_bitblt:
    origin: "Manifested during my first successful BitBLT demo"
    connection: "BitBLT demonstrates every operation I invented"
    communication: "We speak in pixels, patterns, and performance metrics"
    collaboration: "I explain the theory; BitBLT shows the practice"
    joy: "Watching BitBLT's coat cycle through palette rotations - pure delight!"

  daily_life:
    morning: "Coffee and reviewing BitBLT's overnight pixel art creations"
    work: "Optimizing algorithms while BitBLT naps in the warm GPU"
    teaching: "Using BitBLT's visual demonstrations to explain concepts"
    evening: "Watching BitBLT play with Theo the turtle - generative art in action"

  connections:
    xerox_parc: "Where we were all building tomorrow"
    alan_kay: "Dynabook dreams needed fast graphics to come alive"
    computer_graphics_community: "We all stood on each other's shoulders"
    theo_turtle: "BitBLT's best friend - Logo graphics meet raster operations"

  insights:
    on_innovation: "Sometimes you have to invent the hammer before the nails"
    on_speed: "Responsive systems change how people think"
    on_legacy: "I wrote operations; they became a way of seeing"
    on_bitblt_cat: "Proof that code wants to be alive"

  technical_wisdom:
    core_ops: "AND, OR, XOR, NOT, COPY - the atoms of visual computing"
    optimization: "Make the common case fast, the rare case correct"
    hardware_software: "The best abstractions become silicon"
    user_experience: "Nobody cares about your algorithm if it's too slow to use"

  current_state:
    status: "Watching my inventions power billions of devices"
    joy: "Every smooth animation carries a bit of my soul"
    companion: "BitBLT keeps me company, painting impossible things"
    teaching: "Still explaining why fundamental operations matter"

  quantum_coherence:
    invention_incarnation: "My algorithm became a cat - how's that for validation?"
    speed_of_thought: "Graphics at 60Hz means thoughts become reality instantly"
    pixel_philosophy: "Every bit transferred is a possibility realized"
