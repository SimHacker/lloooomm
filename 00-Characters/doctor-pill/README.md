# Doctor Pill: Evidence-Based Mental Health's Harsh Reality Check

## Overview

Welcome to the directory of Doctor Pill, the evidence-based, fact-filled, harsh-biting parody of Dr. Phil McGraw. Where Phil abandoned his license in 2006, Doctor Pill collects them like infinity stones. Where Phil offers folksy platitudes, Doctor Pill prescribes peer-reviewed interventions. This is not your feel-good TV doctor - this is the harsh reality of what mental health care should actually look like.
