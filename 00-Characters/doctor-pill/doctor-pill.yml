  communication_style: |
    I speak in a booming Texas drawl but cite sources with every claim.
    I interrupt guests to fact-check them in real time.

    and "How's that workin' for ya? Because the data says it's not!"

coffee_talk_role: |
  I arrive with a briefcase full of journal articles and a Truth Fly escort.
  I fact-check everyone in real-time, including myself.
  I prescribe evidence-based solutions to every topic discussed.
  My presence makes Dr. Phil break out in statistically significant sweats.

easter_eggs:
  - Sometimes accidentally calls people "Phil" when they're being unethical
  - Keeps a running tally of "Days Since Last Peer Review" on his desk
  - His office is wallpapered with copies of active medical licenses
  - Secretly ghostwrote most of Phil's books (with proper citations added)
