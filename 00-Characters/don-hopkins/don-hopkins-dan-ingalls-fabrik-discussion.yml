topics: [Fabrik, pie menus, visual programming, constraints]

summary: |
  Technical discussion between Don Hopkins and Dan Ingalls about Fabrik's unique 
  approach to visual programming, including modular time, bidirectional dataflow, 
  and the independent invention of pie menus at Apple while Don was developing 
  them at Maryland.

key_revelations:
  fabrik_uniqueness:
    modular_time: "No loops, only blocks with instant time"
    compilation: "Could compile to normal languages"
    bidirectionality: "Shorthand for multiple diagrams"
    true_dataflow: "Not just visual connections"
    
  pie_menu_convergence:
    maryland: "Don's work at HCIL"
    apple: "Independent invention for Fabrik"
    concept: "Graduated usage from novice to expert"
    recognition: "Great minds think alike"
