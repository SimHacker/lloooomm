## Transcript with Annotations

### 0:00 - Opening
**[Applause]**

### 0:04 - Introduction
**Don**: "Hope my screen saver hasn't... oh, I think I have to turn on video mirroring here."

*[Technical setup - adjusting display settings]*

### 0:20 - DreamScape Overview
**Don**: "Good morning. Okay, um, I'm gonna demonstrate DreamScape which is... oh there we go. DreamScape is a constructive experience built on ScriptX that combines a whole lot of different metaphors and demonstrates many of the neat things about ScriptX."

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- Constructive experience
- Multiple metaphors
- ScriptX capabilities demonstration

### 0:35 - Rooms and Objects
**Don**: "It's based on rooms and objects. We're in a room here and here's an object, a part. And the rooms are connected together in a map."

**Annotation**: This demonstrates the spatial metaphor that would later influence Don's work on memory palaces and spatial navigation interfaces.

### 0:43 - User Representation and Navigation
**Don**: "Now this is my user representation, this is Bill... and we click on them and we get a map centered on where we are. So we're in this room here."

*[Demonstrates map navigation]*

**Don**: "I can actually edit this map, disconnect it... and I could say give this presentation backwards by starting over here."

### 1:02 - Room Navigation
**Don**: "So I can move around and I can bounce off the side and then go off the edge into a different room."

**Technical Innovation**: Seamless room-to-room navigation with physics-based movement.

### 1:08 - Interactive Objects
**Don**: "Let's see, so there I find things in the room. Who let... see here's like a flower and we have some animated objects and this is a weird spiral thing."

### 1:18 - Constructive Play
**Don**: "We can do constructive things with them like stick them together and, you know, build like barrel of monkeys or you know Mr. Potato Head type things."

**Design Philosophy**: Playful construction as a core interaction paradigm.

### 1:27 - Object Behaviors
**Don**: "Some of these things have behaviors like this... this is for duplicating things. So I'll just drag it over the flower - boom! And it, you know, like fission, just makes another flower."

### 1:37 - The Magic Head
**Don**: "Fortunately the head is magic so we see... because the head represents you and if you duplicated you and then you went out of the room, you know... which? But anyway, what would you do, you know? So I had to put some special code in there."

**Annotation**: Early consideration of identity and presence in virtual spaces - a precursor to avatar systems.

### 2:01 - Astral Traveling
**Don**: "You can do this astral traveling by clicking on the head and then going to another room and then you don't have the head and you can't get out. So don't lose your head but remember where you left it!"

**Humor in Design**: Don's characteristic playful approach to serious technical concepts.

### 2:17 - Content Import
**Don**: "Great content, how do you get great content? You got to import it from different sources like Director files, AI things, and bitmaps."

### 2:26 - Templates for Non-Programmers
**Don**: "This is intended to provide some templates for people to import common things without having to program."

**Key Innovation**: Democratizing content creation by providing templates.

### 2:38 - Audio Integration
**Don**: "Like these records here, you can just drop an audio file into place and just drop a new image of the record and you got a new..."

*[Demonstrates record player with custom audio]*

**Don**: "I hope we're debating about whether anybody will remember how to use this user interface here."

### 3:10 - Director Integration
**Don**: "A lot of these animations are defined in Director. So the same way, you know, Director doesn't make Photoshop obsolete - you do your images in Photoshop and then load them in Director and animate them. We load our animations into Director and put registration points on them. I've made a special Director exporter."

**Technical Architecture**: Leveraging existing tools (Director) for content creation while adding ScriptX-specific features.

### 3:42 - ESP Wind Feature
**Don**: "I have ESP, I can use wind to blow objects around. It's like whoa!"

*[Demonstrates physics-based wind interaction]*

### 3:56 - Distribution Model
**Don**: "Each of these rooms here is an object that we can distribute, say on the web as a separate title container. We can use ScriptX as a web helper application."

**Visionary Concept**: Anticipating web-based distribution of interactive content years before it became common.

### 4:16 - Web Integration Vision
**Don**: "You could get more records and things and people could publish interesting interactive objects."

### 4:39 - Design Philosophy
**Don**: "This is not a killer app, it's... okay, it's a nurturing environment. We want to give creative people like an environment in which to, you know, plant their seeds to fertile ground instead of the killer app."

**Key Quote**: Emphasizing creativity and nurturing over competitive "killer app" mentality.

### 5:10 - The Smooching User Interface
**Don**: "This is the smooching user interface - they just kiss them up!"

*[Demonstrates object connection through "kissing" gesture]*

### 5:26 - Objects as Authoring Tools
**Don**: "These objects can be authoring tools, little mini authoring tools like this map you could consider a way to change, you know, just move things around."

### 5:50 - Dynamic Extensibility
**Don**: "Dynamic extensibility, we have multimedia distributed multimedia publishing. You can take these neat objects and..."

### 6:07 - Butterfly Agent
**Don**: "Like this butterfly here, you could call that an agent if you're... whoa! Okay, he just flew away, let's follow him, see where he went."

**Annotation**: Early example of autonomous agents in interactive environments.

### 6:55 - Robot Construction
**Don**: "These things here are robot parts and I can grab them and stick them together... like that, and just kind of like Legos."

### 7:11 - Director Authoring Process
**Don**: "These again were defined in Director. I'll pop over to Director and this is how you define them."

*[Shows Director interface]*

**Don**: "You have the animations in the timeline and you have the names you want to give them up here as labels, and you can put sounds in. And then these things here are the registration points - neck, left shoulder, left leg."

**Technical Detail**: Registration points allow for modular assembly of animated parts.

### 7:33 - Registration Point System
**Don**: "You just take the cast, you put in rectangles for the places you want to plug things in. You just stick them down on the thing and just do that for every frame, and then you've got yourself an animation."

### 8:16 - Avatar Construction Kit
**Don**: "So this is your little, you know, Avatar construction kit so to speak."

**Historical Note**: Early use of the term "avatar" for user-customizable characters.

### 8:34 - Multiple Metaphors
**Don**: "What is this good for? You know what? As Negroponte says, direct manipulation is only good for driving and sex. There's some other... we need some other interfaces, and this is a multiple metaphor system."

### 8:47 - Netscape Integration
**Don**: "That little Netscape icon you saw there is a dynamically loaded part that gives us an interface to Netscape. I'm running Netscape locally."

**Revolutionary Feature**: Real-time integration between ScriptX and web browser.

### 9:02 - Dynamic HTML Generation
**Don**: "ScriptX calling hello! This is talking to ScriptX locally. It's dynamically generating HTML."

*[Shows HTML being generated from ScriptX]*

### 9:18 - Class Browser
**Don**: "These services are registered. There's a class browser... it just looks at the classes that are in memory, generates a web page to describe it that you wouldn't want to have to write yourself."

### 9:42 - HTML Collections
**Don**: "The cool thing are these HTML things are like collections. They're very easy to manipulate from ScriptX. You just say 'for I in interesting things do collect a link to I as a bulleted list' and you've got this bulleted list."

**Programming Innovation**: Treating HTML as manipulable data structures.

### 10:01 - Tool Philosophy
**Don**: "This is a tool here that uses Netscape as an interface."

### 10:14 - Dynamic C Extensions
**Don**: "When this DreamScape thing runs, it dynamically loads a C extension that lets it talk to Netscape."

### 10:28 - Inspector Integration
**Don**: "The DreamScape thing registers an inspector for this application."

*[Shows room inspector in browser]*

### 10:48 - GIF Export
**Don**: "It loads the GIF exporter, writes out a little thumbnail of the room that we're in, tells us the neighbors to the left is a volcano."

### 11:02 - Nested Structure Visualization
**Don**: "This is a nested bulleted list reflecting the structure. So an animated puppet part which is the body. The cool thing is we can click on these links - this room browser has links to object browsers."

### 11:19 - Live Property Editing
**Don**: "Here's some forms to edit like his elasticity. We'll make that guy 2 and then hit submit."

*[Demonstrates live parameter adjustment through web interface]*

**Don**: "So that just changes that guy's elasticity."

### 12:00 - Bidirectional Updates
**Don**: "I've changed the structure and I'll go back to Netscape and then link back to the room here and you'll see the change reflected in the outline."

### 13:05 - Image Maps as Live Interfaces
**Don**: "I could click on this image here and this is like an image map but it's talking to a real program and it can look at the coordinates of the mouse click and then go to the real thing that you clicked on."

### 13:44 - Under the Hood
**Don**: "Let me give you a peek under the hood of ScriptX."

### 13:59 - Cross-Platform Integration
**Don**: "This is using an interface to Netscape that also works with the Spyglass browser and also works on Windows."

### 14:09 - Closing
**Don**: "So this is the log of the ScriptX server..."

*[Demo ends]*

## Historical Significance

This demo, presented in 1995, anticipated many concepts that would become mainstream years later:
- Web-based applications
- Dynamic content loading
- Visual programming environments
- User-generated content systems
- Mixed metaphor interfaces
- Browser as application platform

## Design Philosophy

Throughout the demo, Don emphasizes:
- Playfulness and experimentation
- Empowering non-programmers
- Multiple ways to interact with content
- Integration rather than replacement of tools
- "Nurturing environment" over "killer app"

This philosophy would continue to influence Don's work on The Sims, pie menus, and later projects.
