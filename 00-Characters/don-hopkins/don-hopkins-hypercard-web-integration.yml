historical_significance:
  firsts:
    - "First graphical web page authoring for kids"
    - "First live interactive web apps by non-programmers"
    - "Bridge between desktop and web paradigms"
    
  timing: "1994-1996 (pre-JavaScript dominance)"
  
quotes:
  - "The earliest easiest way that non-programmers and even kids could publish live interactive apps on the web!"
  - "Not how the ideal system SHOULD have been designed, but amazingly executed"
  - "Kids can use HyperCard. Publish live HyperCard stacks on the web. Problem solved!"

technical_limitations:
  - "Required Macintosh web server"
  - "Limited QuickTime support"
  - "No button highlighting"
  - "Could be slow"
