name: "HyperLook: The PostScript HyperCard for NeWS"
type: project/system/retrospective
speaker: Don Hopkins
collaborators: [Arthur van Hoff, Tim Niblett]
timespan: "1989-1992"
location: Turing Institute, Glasgow
context: "HyperCard-inspired visual programming environment"

summary: |
  HyperLook (née HyperNeWS née GoodNeWS) was a PostScript-based visual programming 
  environment inspired by HyperCard but designed for network-transparent computing. 
  It used PostScript for code, graphics, and data representation - anticipating 
  modern AJAX architecture by decades.

key_themes:
  hypercard_inspiration: "Taking Bill Atkinson's vision to the network"
  postscript_everywhere: "Code, graphics, and data in one language"
  network_transparency: "True distributed computing before the web"
  visual_programming: "Direct manipulation of live objects"
  structured_graphics: "Stencil-paint instead of pixels"

technical_innovations:
  - three_axes_of_ajax:
      code: "PostScript instead of JavaScript"
      graphics: "PostScript instead of HTML/CSS"
      data: "PostScript instead of XML/JSON"
  - client_server_architecture: "Network-transparent from the ground up"
  - live_editing: "Modify running applications"
  - component_integration: "Seamless copy/paste between apps"
