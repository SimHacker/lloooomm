title: "Pie Menus: Development History and Implementations"
subtitle: "Documentation of pie menu research and implementations (1986-2016)"

overview: |
  Pie menus are circular context menus where selection is based on direction 
  rather than position. Based on Fitts's Law principle that time to acquire 
  a target depends on distance and size.

    title: "An Empirical Comparison of Pie vs. Linear Menus"
    authors: ["Jack Callahan", "Don Hopkins", "Mark Weiser", "Ben Shneiderman"]
    venue: "CHI 1988"
    findings:
      - "Pie menus 15-20% faster than linear menus in controlled tests"
      - "Lower error rates for experienced users"
      - "Direction-based selection more memorable than position"
    
  design_principles:
    - "Equal angular wedges for each item"
    - "Selection by direction from center"
    - "Distance from center can modify selection"
    - "Maximum 8 items for optimal performance"

current_status: |
  Pie menus remain a niche but persistent interface technique. Most successful
  in specialized applications where speed and muscle memory are priorities.
  The Sims remains the most widespread consumer application.
