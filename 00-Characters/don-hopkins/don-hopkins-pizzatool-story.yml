name: "The Story of Sun Microsystems PizzaTool"
type: story/demo/controversy
speaker: Don Hopkins
date: 1992
company: Sun Microsystems
context: "NeWS Window System Wars"

summary: |
  The story of how Don accidentally ordered the first pizza over the internet 
  while developing an example application for NeWS. What started as a PostScript 
  programming demonstration became a lightning rod in the Window System Wars 
  between NeWS and X11.
