conference_demos: ["CHI'90 Empowered Show", "Various NeWS demonstrations"]

summary: |
  Revolutionary visual programming and debugging environment for PostScript/NeWS that 
  treated code as navigable, editable data structures. Featured seamless zooming, 
  direct manipulation of live objects, and the "Pseudo Scientific Visualizer" for 
  exploring complex data structures.

key_themes:
  - code_as_data: "PostScript programs are data structures you can visualize"
  - spatial_navigation: "Navigate through code like a landscape"
  - live_programming: "Edit running programs while they execute"
  - visual_debugging: "See the shape of your bugs"
  - metacircular_beauty: "ps.ps - PostScript implemented in PostScript"

major_innovations:
  - visual_stack_display: "See the PostScript stack as visual objects"
  - object_inspector: "Direct manipulation of live PostScript objects"
  - seamless_zooming: "Powers of Ten inspired navigation"
  - pseudo_scientific_visualizer: 
      tagline: "The object browser for the other half of your brain"
      features: "Fish-eye lens for deeply intertwingled networks"
