name: "ScriptX and DreamScape: Multimedia Programming at Kaleida Labs"
type: project/demo/philosophy
speaker: Don Hopkins
company: Kaleida Labs
date: "1995"
event: "Apple WWDC 1995"
context: "Joint Apple-IBM multimedia venture"

summary: |
  Don's work at Kaleida Labs on ScriptX, a revolutionary multimedia programming 
  environment that combined object-oriented Dylan-like language with sophisticated 
  multimedia libraries. The DreamScape demo at WWDC 1995 showcased integration 
  with web browsers and dynamic content generation.

key_themes:
  multimedia_integration: "Object-oriented approach to time and media"
  web_pioneering: "Pre-JavaScript browser scripting attempts"
  creative_demos: "Floating eyeballs and pizza ordering"
  lost_futures: "What could have been for web development"

technical_innovations:
  clock_hierarchy:
    concept: "Time as first-class citizen"
    implementation: "Clocks in containment hierarchy like views"
    features:
      - "Temporal transformations (offset/scale)"
      - "Automatic synchronization"
      - "QuickTime integration"
      - "Play video backwards with audio"
      
  multiple_inheritance:
    usage: "Like it was going out of style"
    example: "Views as collections you append to"
    benefit: "Natural object composition"

dreamscape_demo:
  wwdc_1995:
    components: [ScriptX, Director, Netscape]
    integration: "SpyGlass remote control API"
    achievement: "Didn't crash (no pushups required)"
    near_disaster: "Came close to flying off rails"
    
  design_philosophy:
    title: "Link Globally, Interact Locally"
    vision: "Browser scripting before JavaScript"
    approach: "Dynamic web content generation"

technical_components:
  scriptx_web_module:
    purpose: "Web integration"
    capabilities: "Server-side rendering"
    innovation: "Early web application framework"
    
  animation_library:
    import: "Director files via MMP plugin"
    evolution: "Became Shockwave browser plugin"
    status: "No big deal but it worked"

memorable_demos:
  pizza_demo:
    implementation: "ScriptX player as helper app"
    features:
      - "Download pizza crusts and toppings"
      - "Separate persistent objects in Bento"
      - "Dynamic assembly by sprinkling"
      - "Draggable toppings"
      - "Eyeball toppings tracking mouse"
    significance: "Showed programmable object power"
    
  lou_gerstner_demo:
    audience: "IBM CEO"
    cursor: "Floating bouncing rotating eyeball"
    reaction: "Too 'right brained' for him"
    response: "Sorry, must have used wrong eyeball!"

development_context:
  early_work: "Cable TV set-top boxes"
  transition: "Department closed, moved to marketing"
  role: "Demos and white papers until the end"
  
  goals:
    - "Browser scripting language"
    - "Web authoring tool"
    - "Static site generation"
    - "Dynamic content creation"

comparisons:
  vs_javascript:
    timing: "ScriptX too big, not ready"
    result: "JavaScript happened instead"
    lesson: "Right idea, wrong implementation"
    
  vs_hypercard_web:
    similarity: "Trying to bridge desktop and web"
    approach: "More ambitious, less practical"
    outcome: "Too complex for adoption"

quotes:
  - "I miss being able to play video backwards at full speed with audio!"
  - "The floating eyeball was a recurring motif"
  - "It actually didn't crash (or I would have had to do pushups)"
  - "Quite a rube-goldberg contraption!"
