title: "Don Hopkins's Sims Design Document Annotations"
subtitle: "Complete Archive of Inline Comments and Handwritten Notes (1996-1998)"
description: |
  A comprehensive collection of every annotation, correction, and comment Don Hopkins 
  made on The Sims design documents from the Happy Friends Home proposal through 
  Draft 7. These annotations shaped the game's UI, advocated for inclusion, and 
  established design patterns that persist today.

    hopkins_annotations:
      milestone_footnote:
        location: "Live Mode UI section"
        text: "(NOTE: Live mode chapter below is based on the work done for 9/30 delivery milestone. On 9/28 a conversation with Don Mattrick and others suggested additional changes be considered. Those changes will be taken up in the next design milestone.)"
        significance: "Established the two-week iteration cycle"
        
      ui_layout_sketch:
        description: "Hand-drawn brackets and arrows labeling UI components"
        elements:
          - "Family Gallery placement"
          - "Brain panel structure"
          - "Subpanel areas for mood/skills/personality"
        impact: "This sketch became the foundation for The Sims' modular HUD"
        
      autonomy_emphasis:
        annotation: "Underlined 'don't discard autonomy'"
        context: "Response to suggestions to simplify by removing autonomous behavior"
        result: "Autonomy remained core to the game design"

  draft_3_review:
    date: "1998-08-07"
    title: "The Sims Design Document Draft 3 - Don's Review"
    version: "v.2"
    
    typo_corrections:
      control_panel:
        original: "DONTROL PANEL UI"
        correction: "Control Panel UI"
        locations: ["ToC page 1", "ToC page 2", "Multiple references throughout"]
        
      in_world_ui:
        original: "DN the World UI"
        correction: "In the World UI"
        locations: ["ToC", "Section headers"]
        
      impact: "Prevented cascading naming inconsistencies across 17+ code modules"
    
    romance_system_critique:
      location: "People → Social Motives → Romance section"
      
      heterosexism_callout:
        quote: |
          "The whole relationship design and implementation (I've looked at the tree 
          code) is Heterosexist and Monosexist. The code tests to see if the sex of 
          the people trying to romantically interact is the same, and if so, the 
          result is a somewhat violent negative interaction, clearly homophobic."
        
      proposed_solution:
        quote: |
          "It would be much more realistic to model it by two numbers from 0 to 100 
          for each person, which was the likelihood of that person being interested 
          in a romantic interaction with each sex."
        
      inclusive_modeling:
        options_described:
          - "Monosexual heterosexual (all we have now)"
          - "Monosexual homosexual"
          - "Bisexual"
          - "Nonsexual (mother theresa, presumably)"
          - "All shades in between (most of the rest of the world's population)"
      
      philosophical_stance:
        quote: |
          "Anyone who is afraid that it might offend the sensibilities of other 
          people (but of course not themselves) is clearly homophobic by proxy but 
          doesn't realize it since they're projecting their homophobia onto other 
          people."
        
      growth_through_games:
        quote: |
          "Anyone offended by that needs to grow up and get a life, and hopefully 
          our game will help them in that quest."
    
    romance_reopening:
      date: "1998-08-06"
      note: |
        "Romance note on 8/6: The July milestone implemented much of current Romance 
        design. The success of that design is again under discussion. We will review 
        Romance again when we design the story using character skills set in scenarios. 
        This section has been un-bolded because it is returned to open, undecided status."
      effect: "Moved Romance from 'finalized' back to active development"
    
    ui_feedback_improvements:
      heart_icon_critique:
        problem: "Flashing heart animations divert cognitive attention"
        solution: "Use distinct static icons: broken heart, bouquet, vulture"
        rationale: "Visual states should be glanceable, not attention-grabbing"
      
      relationship_panel:
        suggestion: "Show dual-color gauges beneath each portrait"
        components:
          - "Attraction to male (0-100)"
          - "Attraction to female (0-100)"
          - "Friendship level"

          implementation: "Led to the 'click-in' feedback at valid snap points"
        
        deletion_dependencies:
          quote: "Cannot delete wall because object is on it"
          suggestion: "Better error messaging for dependency conflicts"
          icons_sketched: "Left margin contains tool selection visual shorthand"
      
      terrain_water_interaction:
        margin_note: "Water tool to move terrain down?"

    autonomy_and_events:
      fire_disaster:
        question: "Do objects need a burnt state?"

      autonomy_scale:
        annotation: "Cool! Tweak up autonomy"
        context: "Next to hierarchy of action priorities"

    thought_balloons:
      sample_text: ["Hi?", "Cool!", "Wow!"]

        annotation: "Love the idea! Cool gibberish"
        
      localization_strategy:
        suggestion: "Tooltips will be translated"
        consideration: "Icons and text work in different languages"
