conclusion: |
  Don Hopkins's timeline with The Sims reveals a consistent pattern: 
  identifying fundamental problems, proposing elegant solutions, and 
  fighting for principles even when it's uncomfortable. From the moment 
  he saw two female Sims slap instead of kiss, through his meticulous 
  design reviews and revolutionary code architectures, to his ongoing 
  commitment to open source and education, Don has embodied the ideal 
  of the consciousness programmer - someone who builds systems that 
  amplify human potential while respecting emergence and celebrating 
  diversity.
