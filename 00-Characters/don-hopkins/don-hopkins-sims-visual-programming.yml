summary: |
  Don's work on The Sims included developing the SimAntics visual programming 
  language for AI behaviors, the Edith editing environment, and various content 
  creation tools. SimAntics allowed game designers to program character behaviors 
  visually without writing code.

title: "SimAntics Visual Programming System"
subtitle: "The Sims Behavior Programming Language"

overview: |
  SimAntics was the visual programming language used in The Sims to define
  object behaviors and Sim interactions. Paired with the Edith visual editor.

technical_details:
  language_type: "Visual scripting language"
  execution_model: "Stack-based virtual machine"
  primary_developer: "Patrick J. Barrett III"
  
components:
  simantics:
    description: "Runtime engine for behavior trees"
    features:
      - "Visual behavior trees"
      - "Stack-based execution"
      - "Advertisement system"
      - "Motive satisfaction calculations"
      
  edith:
    description: "Visual editing tool for SimAntics"
    features:
      - "Tree-based visual editor"
      - "Drag-and-drop behavior creation"
      - "Real-time testing"
      - "Debugging tools"

behavior_system:
  structure:
    - "Objects advertise available interactions"
    - "Sims evaluate advertisements based on needs"
    - "Selected behaviors execute as trees"
    - "Success/failure propagates through branches"
    
  example_behaviors:
    toilet:
      advertises: "Bladder relief"
      check: "Is toilet available?"
      actions: ["Route to toilet", "Use toilet", "Update bladder motive"]
      
    refrigerator:
      advertises: "Hunger satisfaction"
      check: "Food available?"
      actions: ["Open door", "Get food", "Close door"]

advantages:
  - "Non-programmers could create behaviors"
  - "Visual debugging of AI decisions"
  - "Modders could extend game behaviors"
  - "Real-time behavior modification"

legacy:
  - "Influenced visual scripting in later games"
  - "Demonstrated viability of visual programming for games"
  - "Enabled extensive modding community"

note: |
  SimAntics allowed The Sims team to rapidly iterate on behaviors
  without recompiling. Content creators could script complex
  interactions using visual tools rather than code.
