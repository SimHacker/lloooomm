summary: |
  Documentation of the evolution of The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) through three major 
  versions, from NDE (NeWS Development Environment) to TNT 3.0. Shows how 
  performance optimization and architectural improvements were achieved while 
  maintaining PostScript's power.

key_themes:
  performance_optimization: "Twice the speed and half the size"
  architectural_evolution: "From canvas-heavy to lightweight regions"
  toolkit_maturity: "Each version more efficient and elegant"
  documentation_archaeology: "Discovering lost manuals online"

version_history:
  nde_tnt_1_0:
    name: "NeWS Development Environment"
    release: "OpenWindows 1.0"
    characteristics:
      - "Big, new, complex object-oriented PostScript toolkit"
      - "X11 window manager written in NeWS"
      - "Canvas-based objects for everything"
    innovations:
      - "Pie menus and tab windows from scratch"
      - "Could manage X11 windows with NeWS"

  tnt_2_0:
    name: "The NeWS Toolkit 2.0"
    release: "OpenWindows 2.0"
    mantra: "Twice the speed and half the size"
    improvements:
      - "New canvas class plus lightweight regions"
      - "More efficient event service architecture"
      - "Spinning pop-up animation for pie menus"
      - "Air-tight synchronous mouse tracking"
    architectural_changes:
      - "Lightweight regions instead of canvases"
      - "Procedural drawing for UI elements"

  tnt_3_0:
    name: "The NeWS Toolkit 3.0"
    release: "OpenWindows 3.0"
    refinements:
      - "Window frame overhaul"
      - "Menus as real window frames"
      - "Pin-up menus stay on screen"
      - "Even more efficient architecture"
