      brain_panel:
      description: "UI panel sketches showing subdivisions for:"
      elements:
          - "Mood indicators"
          - "Need meters"
          - "Personality traits"

      subpanel_system:
      description: "Expandable UI sections"
        categories:
        - "Motives (hunger, energy, fun)"
        - "Skills (cooking, mechanical)"
        - "Personality (neat, outgoing)"
        - "Relationships"
        
  design_notes:
    progressive_disclosure: "Each panel should expand/collapse independently"
    visibility_principle: "Make the invisible visible - but only when players want to see it"
    autonomy_note: "Don't discard autonomy - underlined multiple times"
  
  milestone_footnote:
    text: |
      "(NOTE: Live mode chapter below is based on the work done 
      for 9/30 delivery milestone. On 9/28 a conversation with 
      Don Mattrick and others suggested additional changes be 
      considered. Those changes will be taken up in the next 
      design milestone.)"
    significance: "Established 2-week iteration cycles"

feature_suggestions:
  ui_elements:
      - "Visual representation of AI decisions"
    - "Expandable complexity through panels"
    - "Direct object manipulation"

  tracking_systems:
      - "Skill progression visualization"
      - "Relationship network display"
      - "Mood history tracking"

design_principles:
  progressive_disclosure:
    concept: "Start simple, reveal complexity as needed"
      implementation: "Expandable UI panels"
    
  direct_manipulation:
    concept: "Click on what you want to change"
    implementation: "Context menus on objects"
    
  transparent_ai:
    concept: "Show why Sims make choices"
    implementation: "Thought bubbles and decision queues"
