title: "SimAntics & Edith Technical Documentation"
subtitle: "Visual Programming System in The Sims"

overview: |
  SimAntics was the visual programming language used in The Sims for
  defining object behaviors and Sim interactions. Edith was the visual
  editor tool used to create and debug these behaviors.

technical_details:
  simantics:
    type: "Visual scripting language"
    developer: "Patrick J. Barrett III"
    execution: "Stack-based virtual machine"
    purpose: "Define object behaviors without traditional coding"
    
  edith:
    name: "Edith (Editor for The Sims)"
    type: "Visual behavior tree editor"
    features:
      - "Node-based visual programming"
      - "Real-time debugging"
      - "Live behavior modification"

system_architecture:
  object_driven_ai:
    concept: "Behaviors stored in objects, not Sims"
    implementation:
      - "Objects advertise available interactions"
      - "Sims evaluate advertisements based on needs"
      - "Selected behavior executes as tree"
      
  behavior_trees:
    node_types:
      - "Test nodes (conditions)"
      - "Action nodes (animations, state changes)"
      - "Control flow (branches, loops)"

advertisement_system:
    structure:
      - "Action name (for pie menu)"
      - "Motive satisfaction values"
      - "Skill requirements"
      - "Autonomy weights"
    
example_behavior:
  toilet_object:
    advertisements:
      - action: "Use"
        effects:
          bladder: "+50"
          room: "-10"
      
      - action: "Clean"
        effects:
          room: "+20"
          cleaning_skill: "+1"

debugging_features:
  - "Visual flow highlighting"
  - "Variable inspection"
  - "Step-through execution"
  - "Runtime modification"

modding_capabilities:
  - "Custom objects with behaviors"
  - "New interaction types"
  - "Modified game mechanics"
  - "Self-contained .iff files"

technical_implementation:
  performance:
    - "Interpreted scripting language"
    - "Cached execution paths"
    - "Lazy loading of scripts"
  
  integration:
    - "Animation system triggers"
    - "Sound playback"
    - "UI generation (pie menus)"
    - "Pathfinding requests"

development_timeline:
  1997: "Initial concept and prototypes"
  1998: "Visual editor development"
  1999: "Performance optimization"
  2000: "Shipped with game (hidden)"

impact:
  - "Enabled extensive modding community"
  - "Influenced later visual scripting systems"
  - "Made behavior creation accessible to non-programmers"

note: |
  SimAntics and Edith allowed content creators and modders to extend
  The Sims without traditional programming knowledge. The visual nature
  of the system made it accessible while still being powerful enough
  for complex behaviors.
