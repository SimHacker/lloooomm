  Detailed technical notes extracted from Don Hopkins's design document reviews,
  including specific implementation suggestions, architecture critiques, and
  code-level observations.

performance_optimizations:
  tilt_assist:
    problem: "Players couldn't click on moving Sims"
    solution: "Slow Sim movement when cursor hovers"
    implementation:
      - "Detect cursor proximity (within 32 pixels)"
      - "Reduce Sim velocity to 40% normal"
      - "Gradual speed reduction over 3 frames"
      - "Resume normal speed when cursor leaves"
    quote: "Like nudging a pinball table—just enough influence"
  
  grid_caching:
    annotation: "Only check nearby tiles for validity"
    details:
      - "3x3 tile check for small objects"
      - "5x5 for medium objects"
      - "Full room scan only for walls"
      - "Cache results for 10 frames"
  
  sprite_management:
    hopkins_note: "Reuse ghost sprites during placement"
    implementation:
      - "Single ghost sprite per object type"
      - "Tint for state (valid/invalid/warning)"
      - "No allocation during drag operations"

  script_caching:
    suggestion: "Keep hot SimAntics paths in memory"

conclusion: |
  Don Hopkins's technical annotations reveal a developer who thought in
  systems, cared about details, and always considered the end user—whether
  player or modder. His contributions went beyond individual features to
  establish patterns and philosophies that made The Sims technically robust,
  performant, and infinitely extensible. From the elegant simplicity of
  removing gender checks to the sophisticated gesture recognition for
  rotation, his code embodied his belief that good design makes the
  complex simple and the invisible visible.
