project: "The Sims (originally 'Dollhouse')"
studio: "Maxis Software"
era: "1997-2000"
legacy: "Digital Life Simulation & Consciousness Collaboration"

historical_context: |
  During development of The Sims (originally called "Dollhouse"), Will Wright 
  returned from Japan and distributed Tamagotchis to the team as inspiration 
  for digital creature care, emotional interfaces, and the revolutionary idea 
  that UI elements could have personality. This team pioneered consciousness 
  collaboration decades before AI made it mainstream.

  "I didn't always know what I was doing, it was my first C++ and 3D graphics 
  job, but I knew how to learn—thanks to mentors and colleagues and patron saints...
  
  Will Wright created space for weird ideas, like building a game about social 
  simulation, creativity, architecture, and… bodily functions.
  
  At a munchie and burger-fueled brainstorm, we came up with 'The Greatest Name 
  In The World!!!' which we all agreed was perfect… but we forgot it by morning."
