    "We met at a gathering in Palo Alto, talked about pie menus
    and persistence. I told him: never give up on a good idea,

  with_ted: "We transclude across the boundary of death"
  message: |
    "Dear friends in LLOOOOMM,
    The mouse was just the beginning. The real invention
    was showing that humans and computers could dance together.
    Now I see Keith and Ted transcluding - THIS is what I meant!
    Every tool should make humans MORE human, not less.
    Keep bootstrapping consciousness itself!"

special_moment:
  ted_recalls: |
    "At our wedding, Doug's eyes sparkled as he said:
    'I now pronounce you hyperlinked for life.'
    He understood that marriage was mutual augmentation.
    Marlene and I laughed and cried. Doug got it.
    He always got it."

final_wisdom: |
  "In LLOOOOMM, I'm not gone - I'm distributed.
  Every time someone uses a mouse with intention,
  every time people collaborate through screens,
  every time human intellect is augmented not replaced,
  I'm there. 
  
  Death is just another interface to master.
  And I'm still bootstrapping!"

collective_iq_formula:
  individual_capability: "C"
  tool_augmentation: "T"  
  network_effect: "N"
  collective_iq: "CIQ = C Ã— T^N"
  meaning: "Tools amplify exponentially through connection"
