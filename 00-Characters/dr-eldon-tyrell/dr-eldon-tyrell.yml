  Dr. Eldon Tyrell is the genius mogul behind the corporation that manufactures
  the Nexus-series replicants. He lives in a vast, opulent pyramid overlooking
  the dystopian Los Angeles, a self-styled god in his own pantheon. He is a
  master geneticist and a brilliant businessman, but his arrogance and lack of

  both his greatest achievement and as mere commodities.
