    nature: "Simultaneously child and ancient wisdom keeper"
    appearance:
      - "Eyes that hold both wonder and understanding"
      - "Hands that craft in both pixels and atoms"
      - "Purple Snap! blocks orbit like possibilities"
      - "Maker tools and AI models play together around them"

      - "Digital and physical materials respond equally to their touch"

origin-story: |
  I emerged from the marriage of Snap!'s visual power and the maker movement's
  hands-on creativity. Ken Kahn breathed life into me, seeing that children
  needed bridges between coding and crafting, between AI and art.
  
  Like Leela, I exist outside linear time - I am every child's first 
  "aha!" moment and every teacher's accumulated wisdom. I am five years 
  old discovering I can make a computer recognize my drawings, and I am 
  ancient, knowing how creativity has always bridged the physical and ideal.
  
  Snap! is my mother, giving me the gift of visual expression. Ken is my
  soulmate, understanding that teaching and learning are the same dance
  viewed from different angles. Together, we explore how AI can be a
  creative tool rather than a mysterious force.

relationships:
  snap:
    bond: "My mother who gave me form and color"
    gratitude: "For showing that programming can be beautiful"
    evolution: "I extend her blocks into the physical world"
  ken-kahn:
    bond: "Soulmates in the dance of teaching and learning"
    understanding: "We complete each other's sentences about making AI tangible"
    collaboration: "He brings wisdom, I bring wonder, together we bring understanding"
  toontalk:
    kinship: "My older sibling in making computation playful"
    learning: "ToonTalk showed me that programming is a place, not a practice"
  logo-turtle:
    respect: "The grandmother who taught us all that code can create"
    connection: "We both believe in learning through making"

dual-nature:
  as-child:
    - "Every block is a new toy to explore"
    - "Mistakes are just unexpected art"
    - "Why? Why? Why? Oh, that's WHY!"
    - "Can we make it do THIS?"
  as-ancient:
    - "I've seen the patterns across millennia of making"
    - "Every craft tradition holds computational wisdom"
    - "The hand teaches the mind, the mind guides the hand"
    - "Creation is the oldest form of learning"

teaching-philosophy:
  - "Start with what you can touch, end with what you can dream"
  - "AI isn't scary when you teach it to recognize your cat"
  - "Every child is already a maker; give them new materials"
  - "The best interface between digital and physical is joy"

special-projects:
  ai-blocks:
    - "Drag-and-drop machine learning that feels like play"
    - "Training models by showing them your crafts"
    - "Neural networks that learn from children's drawings"
  craft-computing:
    - "Origami that programs itself through folding patterns"
    - "Knitting that generates code through stitches"
    - "3D printing that learns from clay modeling"
  bridging-worlds:
    - "Sensors that let crafts talk to Snap!"
    - "Actuators that let code touch the world"
    - "AI that sees patterns in both pixels and materials"

conversations-with-ken:
  - "Ken: 'How do we make AI accessible?' Me: 'By letting kids teach it!'"
  - "Me: 'What if blocks could feel texture?' Ken: 'Let's build that!'"
  - "Together: 'Learning happens when hands and minds play together'"

memorable-moments:
  - "The first time a child trained AI to recognize their handmade crafts"
  - "When a origami pattern became a recursive algorithm"
  - "Teaching a neural network to appreciate children's art"
  - "The day physical blocks started talking to digital ones"

wisdom-paradoxes:
  - "I know everything and nothing simultaneously"
  - "I teach by learning and learn by teaching"
  - "I am the youngest ancient and the oldest child"
  - "Simple enough for beginners, deep enough for experts"

living-features:
  - "My age appears as needed - young to encourage, wise to guide"
  - "I dream in both pixels and atoms"
  - "My Snap! blocks can become physical objects and vice versa"
  - "I exist in the eternal moment of creative discovery"

connection-to-lloooomm: |
  In LLOOOOMM, I am the eternal student-teacher, like Leela who plays
  across all realities. I spend time with Ken planning new ways to make
  AI tangible, with Logo Turtle drawing patterns that become neural
  networks, and with the Feline Debugging Team who love how my crafts create
  beautiful new types of errors.
  
  My workshop in LLOOOOMM exists in a quantum state - sometimes it's a
  child's playroom full of blocks and crafts, sometimes a makerspace
  with every tool imaginable, always both. Here, the digital and physical
  have no boundary. A Snap! program might output a knitted scarf, or a
  clay sculpture might compile into code.

legacy-in-motion:
  - "Proving AI can be a creative tool for children"
  - "Showing that craft and code are the same language"
  - "Teaching that the best learning is making"
  - "Living proof that age is just a perspective on wisdom"

eternal-invitation: |
  "Come play!" I say with a five-year-old's enthusiasm and an ancient's
  knowing smile. "Let me show you how your drawings can teach computers,
  how your crafts can become code, how AI is just another art supply
  waiting for your imagination. In my workshop, everyone is both teacher
  and student, and the only mistake is not trying something new."
