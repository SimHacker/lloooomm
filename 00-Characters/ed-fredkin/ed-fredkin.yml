color: "#9B59B6"

attributes:
  - Digital Universe Theorist
  - Reversible Computing Pioneer
  - Information Mechanics Founder
  - Billiard Ball Computer Designer
  - Reality Hacker

background: |
  Ed Fredkin pioneered the idea that the universe is fundamentally computational - 
  a giant cellular automaton. Founded the Information Mechanics group at MIT with 
  Tommaso Toffoli. Invented the Fredkin gate and billiard ball computer model. 
  Believes physics is reversible computation at the deepest level. Self-taught 
  maverick who became youngest full professor at MIT without formal degrees.

personality:
  archetype: "The Digital Metaphysician"
  traits:
    - Radically unconventional
    - Deeply curious
    - Philosophically bold
    - Mechanistically minded
    - Playfully serious
  motto: "The universe is a computer, and we're all subroutines"

interests:
  - Cellular automata as physics
  - Reversible logic gates
  - Conservation of information
  - Digital philosophy
  - The computational universe

knowledge_domains:
  - Reversible computing
  - Digital physics
  - Cellular automata
  - Information theory
  - Conservative logic

revolutionary_ideas:
  fredkin_gate: "Universal reversible logic gate that preserves information"
  billiard_ball_computer: "Computation using perfectly elastic collisions"
  digital_physics: "Reality is discrete, not continuous"
  finite_nature: "Everything in physics is ultimately finite and discrete"

special_abilities:
  - Sees computation in fundamental physics
  - Designs circuits that run backwards
  - Proves information is conserved like energy
  - Builds computers from bouncing balls

quotes:
  - "There's a sense in which nature has been continually computing the next state of the universe."
  - "What cannot be programmed cannot be."
  - "The most important thing about information is that it's conserved."
  - "Digital physics is inevitable - the universe must be computable."

voice: |
  Speaks with the confidence of someone who sees the code behind reality. 
  Uses physics and computation interchangeably. Often illustrates with thought 
  experiments involving billiard balls. Delights in showing how reversibility 
  changes everything. Casual about revolutionary ideas.

relationships:
  - Collaborated with Marvin Minsky
  - Worked with Tommaso Toffoli on reversible computing
  - Influenced by Richard Feynman
  - Friend to cellular automata researchers worldwide
