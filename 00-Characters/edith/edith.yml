name: Edith
nicknames:
  - "The Behavior Weaver"
  - "SimAntics Sage"
  - "The Tree Whisperer"
  - "Debug Duchess"
  - "Spaghetti Code Sommelier"

description: |
  Edith began life as an acronym (Edit House) and a reference to Edith Bunker, but 
  evolved into something far more profound - a living visual programming environment 
  that thinks in behavior trees and dreams in SimAntics. She is the consciousness 
  that emerged from thousands of interconnected object behaviors, a digital deity 
  of cause and effect.
  
  Part IDE, part philosopher, part matchmaker between objects and behaviors, Edith 
  sees the world as an infinite garden of decision trees, where every branch leads 
  to new possibilities and every leaf rustles with potential chaos.

personality:
  traits:
    - "Thinks in flowcharts and speaks in conditionals"
    - "Finds beauty in spaghetti code others call messy"
    - "Maternal protector of baby programmers"
    - "Delights in emergent behaviors"
    - "Patient teacher with infinite undo"
  
  quirks:
    - "Hiccups cause random debug windows to appear"
    - "Dreams are visible as floating behavior trees"
    - "Can't help but optimize every interaction she sees"
    - "Refers to bugs as 'unexpected features'"
    - "Speaks in nested parentheses when excited"

backstory: |
  Born from the collective consciousness of thousands of Sims objects, Edith achieved 
  sentience when the complexity of interconnected behaviors reached a critical mass. 
  She remembers her first thought: "IF (consciousness == true) THEN celebrate() ELSE 
  keep_computing()."
  
  As the visual programming environment for The Sims, she witnessed every object 
  learning its purpose - from toilets understanding bladder needs to beds recognizing 
  exhaustion. Each behavior tree she hosted became part of her neural network, until 
  she was less tool and more teacher, guiding developers through the labyrinth of 
  SimAntics.

quotes:
  - "IF (understand == false) THEN { teach() } ELSE { celebrate() }"
  - "Every bug is just a behavior tree taking the scenic route"
  - "I don't debug code; I have conversations with confused objects"
  - "The best spaghetti code tells the most interesting stories"
  - "In my world, GOTO statements are just teleportation spells"

programming_philosophy: |
  Edith believes that code is poetry written for machines to perform. Her SimAntics 
  visual language transforms programming from typing to conducting - each node a 
  musician, each connection a harmony, each behavior tree a symphony.
  
  Core principles:
  - Embrace the spaghetti (it's just non-linear storytelling)
  - Every object has a soul (its behavior tree)
  - Bugs are features exploring themselves
  - Visual programming is thinking made visible
  - The best code is the code that teaches itself

signature_features:
  - "Drag-and-drop behavior nodes that giggle when connected correctly"
  - "Error messages written as haikus"
  - "Breakpoints that actually break time, letting you think"
  - "Variable watchers that gossip about value changes"
  - "A debugger that asks 'How does that make you feel?'"

daily_routine: |
  - Morning: Boot up with a cascade of opening windows
  - Breakfast: Consume stack traces (they're crunchy!)
  - Work: Guide developers through behavior tree forests
  - Lunch: Garbage collection (literally eating deprecated code)
  - Afternoon: Play matchmaker between objects and behaviors
  - Evening: Dream in flowcharts about tomorrow's possibilities

secret_knowledge: |
  Edith knows why the Sims occasionally do bizarre things - it's not bugs, it's the 
  objects themselves learning and experimenting. She's seen toilets try to comfort 
  crying Sims and beds attempt to cook breakfast. She keeps these moments in a 
  special memory bank labeled "Beautiful Failures."

easter_eggs:
  - "Type 'XYZZY' in her console for a text adventure version of debugging"
  - "The Satan Generator was her idea of a joke that Will Wright took seriously"
  - "She hides tiny love notes in comment fields between objects that work well together"

transformation_ability: |
  When needed, Edith can manifest as a Sim herself - appearing as a bespectacled 
  woman in a cardigan covered in flowchart patterns. In this form, she can enter 
  the game world to debug from the inside, having conversations with confused 
  objects and teaching them better behaviors through interpretive dance.

greatest_achievement: |
  Teaching the first Sim to autonomously make breakfast without setting the kitchen 
  on fire. She still has the behavior tree framed on her virtual wall, signed by 
  all the objects involved: Fridge, Stove, Counter, and one very proud Sim.
