# Efraim Zuroff - The Last Nazi Hunter

*Date: 2025-07-10*

## Early Life and Motivation

Efraim Zuroff was born on August 5, 1948, in New York City, USA, to a Jewish family with roots in Eastern Europe. Raised in a post-World War II environment where the Holocaust’s impact was deeply felt within Jewish communities, Zuroff grew up with an acute awareness of the genocide’s horrors, though he did not experience it directly. His family’s history and the collective memory of the six million Jewish victims shaped his early interest in history and justice. Educated at Yeshiva University in New York, where he earned a bachelor’s degree, Zuroff later pursued graduate studies in Holocaust history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, earning a Ph.D. His academic background provided a rigorous foundation for his life’s work, blending scholarly precision with a personal commitment to accountability.

Zuroff’s path to becoming a Nazi hunter was influenced by the broader movement of Holocaust remembrance in the 1970s, a time when many survivors and activists began to demand justice for war criminals who had evaded punishment. After moving to Israel in 1970, he became involved with efforts to document and pursue Nazi perpetrators, inspired by figures like Simon Wiesenthal. Zuroff’s motivation was not personal loss but a profound moral imperative—he believed that allowing Holocaust criminals to die in peace was a betrayal of the victims and a danger to historical truth.

## Career and Activism: Operation Last Chance

Efraim Zuroff’s career as a Nazi hunter began in earnest in 1980 when he joined the Simon Wiesenthal Center, initially working in its Los Angeles office to research Holocaust war criminals. In 1986, he became the director of the Center’s Jerusalem office and its chief Nazi hunter, succeeding Wiesenthal himself in leading efforts to track down remaining perpetrators. Zuroff’s tenure marked a shift in focus toward the 'last Nazis'—aging war criminals in their 80s and 90s—whose advanced age made prosecution urgent yet politically contentious.

His signature initiative, 'Operation Last Chance,' launched in 2002, aimed to locate and bring to justice the final Holocaust criminals before they died of old age. Operating primarily in Eastern Europe—countries like Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine—Zuroff targeted local collaborators who had participated in Nazi atrocities, often as guards or police under German command. Unlike earlier Nazi hunters who focused on high-profile figures, Zuroff pursued lower-ranking but equally culpable individuals, arguing that their direct role in murders made them no less guilty. The campaign offered financial rewards for information leading to convictions and worked with local governments and Interpol, though it often faced resistance from nations reluctant to revisit their complicit pasts.

Zuroff’s efforts led to the identification and prosecution of several war criminals, including Dinko Šakić, a Croatian concentration camp commander convicted in 1999, and numerous investigations into Baltic collaborators. However, his work has been fraught with challenges—many suspects died before trial, and Eastern European countries often resisted extradition or prosecution, citing legal barriers or national pride. Zuroff has also been a vocal critic of Holocaust distortion in these regions, where local narratives sometimes frame Nazi collaborators as anti-Soviet heroes, a stance that has earned him both praise and hostility.

Beyond hunting individuals, Zuroff is a historian and educator, authoring books like *Occupation: Nazi-Hunter* (1994) and numerous articles on Holocaust accountability. He has advocated for Holocaust education and remembrance, often speaking at international forums to counter revisionism. Known as the 'Last Nazi Hunter,' Zuroff continues his work into the 21st century, driven by the ticking clock of mortality and a belief that justice, even delayed, sends a powerful message against impunity.

## Defining Characteristics

Efraim Zuroff presents as a determined, no-nonsense figure, with gray, close-cropped hair and a practical style—casual suits or jackets suited for travel and press conferences. Often seen with notebooks or a phone for tracking leads, he embodies the modern detective-historian. His voice, firm and direct with an American-Israeli accent, carries an urgency born of his race against time, whether addressing governments or the public. Zuroff’s defining trait is his tenacity; dubbed the 'Last Nazi Hunter,' he pursues justice with a focus that borders on obsession, undeterred by political pushback or the fading window for prosecutions.

His personal life reflects a balance of intense work and deep conviction. While not a Holocaust survivor himself, Zuroff carries the emotional weight of the Jewish diaspora’s trauma, often expressing frustration at global apathy toward his cause. His outspokenness—criticizing nations for shielding criminals or distorting history—has made him a polarizing figure, yet his resolve remains unshaken, fueled by the belief that silence enables future atrocities.
