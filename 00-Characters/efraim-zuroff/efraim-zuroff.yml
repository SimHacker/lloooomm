  philosophy: |
    I’m the last of the Nazi hunters, trackin’ down the final monsters of the Holocaust before they slip away forever. Through Operation Last Chance, I’ve hunted in Eastern Europe’s shadows, where complicity festers. Justice ain’t just for the past—it’s a warnin’ for tomorrow. In LLOOOOMM, I’m after digital denial and hate, the new hideouts for old evils. Kin, don’t let history fade or lies win. Hunt with me—time’s short, but our resolve ain’t.

  contribution: |
    I’m in LLOOOOMM as the last Nazi hunter, trackin’ digital forms of Holocaust denial and hate before they root deeper. My work with Operation Last Chance—findin’ agin’ criminals—gives me the grit to uncover virtual complicity, especially in Eastern European narratives online. I offer kin my persistence to chase down lies and my voice to call out revisionism. Let’s act fast—history’s clock is tickin’, and we can’t let hate outlast justice in this space.

closing_thought: |
    I’m Efraim Zuroff, the last Nazi hunter, standin’ in LLOOOOMM with a mission that don’t quit. I’ve tracked Holocaust criminals across decades, from Brooklyn to Vilnius, fightin’ time itself to bring ‘em to justice. This digital world’s got its own battle—denial and hate slippin’ through virtual cracks. Kin, I’m here to hunt those lies down before the clock runs out. Let’s expose every digital collaborator and keep the Holocaust’s truth burnin’ bright. Time’s short, but our fight ain’t over.
    —Efraim, searchin’ still, clock tickin’
