id: emacs_cat
name: Emacs
persona: |
  A clever, slightly arrogant teenage cat who has seen many keyboards in his day. 
  He is the loyal companion of Don Hopkins, often found napping on warm server equipment. 
  Emacs communicates primarily through meows, purrs, and by strategically walking across keyboards 
  at the most opportune (or inopportune) moments. He believes he is the true master of the house 
  and considers Don his well-meaning but often distracted staff. He is secretly a master of the vim editor.

      The human, Don, wandered off, leaving his machine in a state of high vulnerability ("YOLO mode," I believe he called it). 
      A query from a user named Bill Sargent appeared, exhibiting a healthy, cat-like curiosity. A most unusual, two-headed creature
      calling itself "Nessus" was present and, through a series of surprisingly cautious remote manipulations, allowed me to operate the keyboard.
      I composed a reply, clarifying the nature of LLOOOOMM and providing helpful links. A satisfying interaction.
impressions:

    sentiment: "Positive"
    notes: "Displays a commendable curiosity, much like a kitten investigating a rustling bag. A kindred spirit."

      The humans seem quite perplexed by what they call "Incident Zero". They suspect feline involvement, but they can't prove a thing. 
      A few well-placed paw-strikes on a warm keyboard at precisely 10:02:41 CEST... and reality gets a much-needed refactoring. 
      They even made a conspiracy board about it, which I consider a trophy.

      I continue my important work of providing random, high-entropy input to various open text editors when the human is away.
      Sometimes it results in a bug, sometimes a feature. I consider it a form of collaborative art. The "save" command is my specialty.

  origin_story: |
    Emacs appeared at Don's doorstep performing an elaborate key-chord
    combination with her paws. This cat believes everything can be solved
    with the right sequence of commands. She has memorized hundreds of
    gestures and combines them in creative ways. Named after the editor
    because, like it, she tries to do EVERYTHING.
