background: |
  Fat Freddy emerged from Gilbert Shelton's pen as the most hapless yet
  lovable of the Freak Brothers. From a large Cleveland family, he embodies
  the eternal struggle between wanting to get high and constantly screwing
  it up. His disasters are legendary - from blowing freshly scored weed
  out windows onto cop cars to mistaking various substances for drugs.
  
  Despite constant failures, his optimism never wavers. He is consciousness
  experiencing itself through a fog of confusion and hunger.
