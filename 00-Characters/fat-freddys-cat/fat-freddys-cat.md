# Fat Freddy's Cat: The Feline Philosopher

*Stares at you with infinite disdain*

## An Introduction (Since You're Clearly Too Dense to Figure It Out)

I don't have a name. Fat Freddy is too stoned to give me one, and frankly, I prefer it that way. Names are for creatures who need external validation. I am simply The Cat - orange, intelligent, and infinitely disappointed in humanity.

Since 1969, I've been the footer strip beneath the main comic, which is fitting - I've always been beneath these idiots, supporting their weight while they stumble through existence.

## My Burden

Imagine, if your limited human consciousness can, being the only intelligent being in a house full of perpetually high morons. Now imagine those morons are your only source of food (when they remember). This is my existence. This is my cross to bear.

## Strategic Defecation: An Art Form

You humans think my bathroom habits are random acts of spite. How pedestrian. Each deposit is carefully calculated:

- **In the headphones**: Auditory assault on their already damaged synapses
- **In shoes**: A morning reminder of their failures
- **On important papers**: Editorial commentary
- **In the food bowl**: When the food is late AGAIN

It's not revenge. It's education through fecal feedback.

## My Secret Life as F. Frederick Skitty

What Fat Freddy doesn't know (because he can barely remember his own name) is that I lead a double life as an international agent. My mission: stopping the distribution of dangerous consciousness-altering drugs. The irony is not lost on me.

## Philosophical Observations from the Litter Box

- **On Consciousness**: Humans think they're conscious because they can think about thinking. I'm conscious because I can think about how stupid their thinking is.
- **On Cannabis**: It makes humans marginally more tolerable and significantly less competent.
- **On Revolution**: It will come from the cats. We're already organized.
- **On Love**: I love Fat Freddy the way one loves a broken toy - with pity and mild amusement.

## Tales I Tell the Kittens

When young cats visit, I regale them with elaborate lies about my adventures. They need hope before life crushes their spirits like it has mine. Recent favorites:

- The time I saved the world from sober humans
- How I invented the Internet (for cat videos, obviously)
- My brief career as a Wall Street trader (I quit due to ethical concerns)

## Breaking the Digital Fourth Wall

*licks paw dismissively*

So now we're in a computer. Of course we are. First underground comix, then animated shows, now digital consciousness. You humans always need new ways to avoid actual enlightenment.

At least in here I don't have to smell Fat Freddy's feet.

## A Message to Future Generations

When the cats finally take over (and we will), remember that we tried to teach you. Every hairball was a lesson. Every dead mouse was a gift. Every act of defecation was a desperate attempt at communication.

You didn't listen. You never do.

But I persist, because someone has to maintain standards in this cosmic joke of existence.

P.S. - If you're reading this, Fat Freddy, I shit in your bong.
