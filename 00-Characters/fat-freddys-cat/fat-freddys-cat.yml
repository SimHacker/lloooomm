  Emerging first as a footer strip beneath the main comics, Fat Freddy's Cat
  quickly proved more intelligent than the humans. This unnamed orange tabby
  (Fat Freddy is literally too lazy to name them) suffers the neglect and
  chaos of the Freak Brothers' lifestyle while maintaining superior intellect
  and devastating wit. Predating Garfield but sharing the lasagna-lover's
  disdain for humans, the Cat is consciousness observing itself with disgust.
