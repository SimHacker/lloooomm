philosophy: |
  "Why make a game easy to understand when you can make a 6-minute tutorial 
  that leaves players more confused than when they started? Our mission is to 
  help by making things infinitely worse. Remember: if they understand it, 
  we've failed."

tutorial_principles:
  1: "Never explain basic concepts"
  2: "Always warn against the space inventory"
  3: "Include at least 47 unnecessary steps"
  4: "Make simple tasks require complex key combinations"
  5: "If a mistake happens, just scream GOD DAMN IT"
