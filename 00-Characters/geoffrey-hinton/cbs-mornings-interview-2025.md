# CBS Mornings Interview: The Tiger Cub Warning (April 2025)

## "I'm Kind of Glad I'm 77"

### The Interview That Went Viral

On April 26, 2025, Geoffrey Hinton appeared on CBS Mornings in an interview that would be viewed by nearly 2 million people. Standing throughout (due to his chronic back pain), the 77-year-old Nobel laureate delivered his starkest warning yet.

### The Tiger Cub Metaphor

**"The best way to understand it emotionally is we're like somebody who has this really cute tiger cub. It's just such a cute tiger cub. Unless you can be very sure that it's not going to want to kill you when it's grown up, you should worry."**

This became the defining image of the interview - humanity raising something adorable that will devour us.

**"I'm kind of glad I'm 77."**

Translation: I'll be dead before the tiger reaches full size.

## Key Revelations

### 1. The Timeline Compression
- 1986: Hinton proposes neural networks for word prediction
- His prediction then: "We'll get here eventually"
- Reality: 40 years from concept to ChatGPT
- "I didn't think we'd get here in only 40 years"
- "10 years ago I didn't believe we'd get here"

### 2. The Bank Paranoia
Hinton now spreads his money across three different banks. Not because he's wealthy, but because he expects AI-driven cyber attacks to target financial institutions first.

### 3. The Apocalypse Odds
**10-20% risk AI will take over from humans**

But since the interview, he's updated this to be even more pessimistic. By Christmas 2024, he suggested the window might be even shorter.

### 4. The Corporate Betrayal
**On Google**: "Very disappointed" when they broke their promise not to support military AI. "But it's part of a pattern."

**On OpenAI**: "I was quite proud of Ilya for firing Sam Altman, even though it was very naive." (Naive because employees were about to get millions that would be jeopardized)

**On Safety Research**: Companies should spend "a third" of compute on safety. Reality: "Much, much less."

## The Family Legacy

The interview revealed Hinton's legendary family tree:
- Father: Prominent entomologist (contrarian like him)
- Great-great-grandfather: George Boole (Boolean algebra)
- Ancestor: George Everest (the mountain's namesake)

When the interviewer's camera lens broke, Hinton immediately wanted to fix it with duct tape - revealing the tinkerer's mindset that drove his neural network breakthroughs.

## YouTube's Brutal Response

### The Top Comment (3.5K likes)
**@sillybabybilly3178**: "i'm kinda glad i'm 77" is a damn scary thing to hear him say"

This captures the existential horror - when the creator of AI is relieved he won't live to see its conclusion.

### The Reality Check Brigade

**@jerrymeadows5059** (1K likes): "Reasonably certain that the world is not even prepared for the present."

**@sindri** (629 likes): "It's just insane to me how we had warnings for this stuff for decades and people still just marched along making the things that we know we shouldn't mess with. The hubris of man knows no limit."

### The Hypocrisy Hunters

**@Innerhacking** (1.2K likes): "They all say AI is going to end the world but all of them are involved in building more AI systems..."

**@gerharddamm5933** (363 likes): "Insane to hear the same people pushing for AI development at all costs saying 'It will end the world'. Humans really are stupidly hopeless"

### The Economic Prophets

**@heinuchung8680** (595 likes): "Why isn't ai being used to create cheap housing or reduce healthcare cost?"

**@Keithyt3962** (1.2K likes): "I wish they had spent a fraction of that on affordable housing, homelessness, healthcare, education, mental health"

### The Dark Humor

**@HypatiaSensatia** (1.4K likes): "I got sober for this?"

**@droid4369** (297 likes): "Well, I'm gonna go watch cooking videos and pretend like I didn't see this."

**@fidorover** (230 likes): "Thanks for this. I didn't have enough to worry about."

### The Jurassic Park References

**@quentinwooten30** (1.3K likes): "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." - Dr Malcolm

Multiple comments referenced this quote, highlighting how we've literally lived through the "we warned you in fiction" phase.

### The Existential Dread

**@jarredescobedo4** (1.9K likes): "Ah, just a short video to play while i shower" *existential dread*

**@mpbarry46** (1.1K likes): "Feels like the start of every disaster film"

### The American Capitalism Critique

**@futures2247** (1.9K likes): "This moronic system of greed and self interest is destructive"

**@craig8638** (344 likes): "Anyone who's paying attention realizes that. Unfortunately, the price of eggs has captivated the public."

### The Nostalgia Movement

**@WhyNot0004** (674 likes): "Sometimes I wish we could all go back to the payphone days in general it was a better kind of life as a human being"

**@earth2ashes** (74 likes): "They should just shut it down. We don't need ai at all. We were doing fine without it."

## The Media Whiplash

**@Bullxyppsy** (93 likes) captured the surreal tone:
"You gotta love those comforting American morning shows.
Segment: 'Yeah, so AI is basically gonna take over the world potentially destroying it'
Afterwards: 'So, a Nobel Prize winner fixed your lens? *giggles*'"

## The Deeper Implications

### The Contrarian's Curse
Hinton spent decades being mocked for believing in neural networks. Now he's being mocked for warning about them. The man who was right when everyone said he was wrong is now being told he's wrong when he might be right.

### The Age Factor
At 77, standing due to back pain, spreading money across banks, Hinton represents the generation that created the future but won't have to live in it. The YouTube generation sees this clearly - they're inheriting a tiger that someone else raised.

### The Corporate Reality
Every major AI company claims safety is important while lobbying against regulation. Hinton's former colleagues at Google and his protégés at OpenAI are all racing toward a cliff while claiming they're being careful.

## The Unspoken Truth

The most chilling aspect isn't what Hinton says - it's what he doesn't say. When asked if he despairs, he admits:

**"I don't despair but mainly because even I find it very hard to take it seriously... it's very hard to get your head around the fact that we're at this very very special point in history where in a relatively short time everything might totally change at a scale we've never seen before. It's hard to absorb that emotionally."**

Even the man warning us can't fully believe his own warnings. The future is too big to fit in a human mind.

## The Final Image

A Nobel laureate fixing a broken camera lens with duct tape while warning that the technology he helped create might end civilization. A grandfather of AI glad he won't live to see his grandchildren grow up.

The tiger cub is so cute. So very, very cute.

Until it isn't.
