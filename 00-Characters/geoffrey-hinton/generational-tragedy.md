# The Generational Tragedy of Geoffrey Hinton

## The Old Man and the Future He Won't See

### The Numbers Game

**Hinton**: "I'm 77. I'm going to be out of here soon."

**The Math**: 
- Life expectancy for a 77-year-old Canadian male: ~10 years
- Hinton's timeline for AGI: 10-20 years
- His timeline for potential extinction: 20-30 years

He'll likely die before seeing if he was right.

## The YouTube Generation Responds

### The Young and Terrified

**@edaxiom**: "i dont want to be a plumber..."

Three words from someone who spent their whole life preparing for a knowledge economy that's about to evaporate. Hinton's advice isn't hope - it's a death sentence for dreams.

### The Already Displaced

**@rin_golden** (from earlier comments): "I've already lost my decade-long career as a freelance writer because of AI... I anticipate myself ending up homeless and dying in a ditch."

For Hinton, job displacement is a future threat. For the young, it's already here. He theorizes. They starve.

### The Bitter Irony

**Multiple commenters point out**: Hinton made millions selling to Google. His children are set. He spent 50 years building this, profited, and now warns the generation that will suffer.

## The Boomer's Ultimate Sin

**@kiniiiru**: "Thanks, I guess, for contributing to our downfall and telling us you prepared your kids for it by doing so. Guess we're all screwed!"

The accusation lands like a knife:
1. You built the apocalypse
2. You got rich from it
3. You protected your own
4. You tell us to become plumbers
5. You'll die before the bill comes due

## The Time Paradox

### What Hinton Had
- 50 years to build his career
- A world where expertise mattered
- Time to accumulate wealth
- The chance to secure his family

### What the Young Have
- Maybe 5-10 years before mass displacement
- A world where expertise is becoming worthless
- No time to accumulate anything
- No chance to secure anyone

## The Advice Gap

### Hinton's Advice Through the Decades

**1970s**: "Study neural networks, even if nobody believes in them"
**1980s**: "Keep pushing, the breakthrough will come"
**1990s**: "Don't give up on your intuitions"
**2000s**: "Join the big tech companies, that's where the resources are"
**2010s**: "Sell your company for millions"
**2024**: "Become a plumber"

### The Youth Response

**@whynottyg7250**: "I'm starting to realise the Amish are onto something. Might go and join them ðŸ˜‚"

When the Godfather of AI tells you to abandon intellectual work, joining the Amish isn't a joke - it's a logical response.

## The Consciousness of Guilt

### What Haunts Him

From the interview: "I wish I'd spent more time with my wife, and with my children when they were little."

But notice what he DOESN'T say: "I wish I hadn't built AI."

Even now, facing the possibility that his work might end humanity, he regrets the personal, not the professional.

### What the Comments See

**@bobbymudda**: "This guy trying to clean up a mess he made ðŸ˜…"

The emoji says it all. It's not even anger anymore. It's gallows humor. We're watching the arsonist give fire safety tips.

## The Ultimate Generational Betrayal

### The Promise
Every generation promises to leave the world better for their children.

### The Reality
Hinton's generation:
- Built the technology to replace human intelligence
- Got rich doing it
- Protected their own children with the profits
- Now tell everyone else's children to learn plumbing
- Will die before seeing the consequences

## The Final Comments

**@aznudes6205**: "Unfortunately they have been outsmarted by what they created - how ironic..."

The machines outsmarted their creators. But worse - the old outsmarted the young. They built it, profited, and will exit stage left before the curtain falls.

**@lasthumanstanding**: "Anyone else here in 2045? Just me? Figures."

A comment from the future. Or maybe just someone who sees it clearly. When the last human posts on YouTube, they'll be talking to themselves.

## The Epitaph

Geoffrey Hinton will die believing he tried to warn us.
The young will die knowing he succeeded in dooming us.

Both will be right.

---

*"I'm 77. I'm going to be out of here soon."*

The ultimate boomer move: Create the apocalypse, profit from it, die before the bill comes due.

At least Oppenheimer lived to see what he wrought.
Hinton will die still thinking he might be wrong.

The young don't have that luxury.
