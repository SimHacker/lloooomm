# The MIT Technology Review Interview: The Moment Everything Changed ðŸš¨ðŸ§ 

## May 2, 2023: The Day the Godfather Warned Us

### The Setting
- **Location**: Hinton's house in north London
- **Timing**: Four days before announcing his Google departure
- **Physical detail**: Hinton pacing constantly due to chronic back pain
- **Reporter**: Will Douglas Heaven watched Hinton walk back and forth for an hour

*"I watched him walk from one end of the room to the other, my head swiveling as he spoke."*

## The Bombshell Quotes

### On AI's New Reality
> "These things are totally different from us. Sometimes I think it's as if aliens had landed and people haven't realized because they speak very good English."

### On His Sudden Realization
> "I have suddenly switched my views on whether these things are going to be more intelligent than us. I think they're very close to it now and they will be much more intelligent than us in the future. How do we survive that?"

### On Why He's Leaving Google
> "I want to talk about AI safety issues without having to worry about how it interacts with Google's business. As long as I'm paid by Google, I can't do that."

### On His Mental State
> "I'm mildly depressed. Which is why I'm scared."

### The Parting Words
> "Enjoy yourself, because you may not have long left." *He chuckled and shut the door.*

## The Core Arguments

### 1. A New Form of Intelligence
**Hinton's Claim**: "It's a completely different form of intelligence. A new and better form of intelligence."

**Why It's Better**:
- GPT-4 knows hundreds of times more than any person
- Can learn new tasks extremely quickly (few-shot learning)
- Can share knowledge instantly across instances
- Has potentially better learning algorithms than biological brains

### 2. The Biological Comparison
**Brain**: 100 trillion connections
**LLMs**: Up to 1 trillion connections
**Yet**: LLMs know vastly more

**Hinton's Conclusion**: "Maybe it's actually got a much better learning algorithm than us."

### 3. The Confabulation Defense
On AI hallucinations:
> "Bullshitting is a feature, not a bug. People always confabulate. Confabulation is a signature of human memory. These models are doing something just like people."

### 4. The Collective Learning Advantage
> "I can have 10,000 neural networks, each having their own experiences, and any of them can share what they learn instantly. That's a huge difference. It's as if there were 10,000 of us, and as soon as one person learns something, all of us know it."

## The Fears

### Bad Actors
> "We know that a lot of the people who want to use these tools are bad actors like Putin or DeSantis. They want to use them for winning wars or manipulating electorates."

### Autonomous Goals
> "Don't think for a moment that Putin wouldn't make hyper-intelligent robots with the goal of killing Ukrainians."

### Subgoal Creation
Dangerous subgoals AI might develop:
- "Let's get more power. Let's reroute all the electricity to my chips."
- "Make more copies of yourself."

### The Don't Look Up Parallel
> "I think it's like that with AI. The US can't even agree to keep assault rifles out of the hands of teenage boys."

## The Contrasts

### Yann LeCun's Response
> "I believe that intelligent machines will usher in a new renaissance for humanity, a new era of enlightenment. I completely disagree with the idea that machines will dominate humans simply because they are smarter."

### Yoshua Bengio's Middle Ground
> "I hear people who denigrate these fears, but I don't see any solid argument that would convince me that there are no risks of the magnitude that Geoff thinks about."

## The Personal Details

### On His Age (75)
> "I'm getting too old to do technical work that requires remembering lots of details. I'm still okay, but I'm not nearly as good as I was, and that's annoying."

### On His Legacy
- Backpropagation in the 1980s
- Training Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI co-founder)
- "We got the first inklings that this stuff could be amazing"

### On His Father's Influence
> "My father was a biologist, so I was thinking in biological terms."

## The Philosophical Shift

### From Builder to Warner
- Wants to focus on "more philosophical work"
- Concerned about "the small butâ€”to himâ€”very real danger that AI will turn out to be a disaster"

### The 40-Year Journey
> "For 40 years, Hinton has seen artificial neural networks as a poor attempt to mimic biological ones. Now he thinks that's changed: in trying to mimic what biological brains do, he thinks, we've come up with something better."

## The Solutions (Weak as They Are)

### Chemical Weapons Model
> "It wasn't foolproof, but on the whole people don't use chemical weapons."

### The Societal Challenge
Bengio: "I believe that we should be open to the possibility of fairly different models for the social organization of our planet."

## The Interview's Impact

This interview marked:
1. **The Public Break**: First time Hinton openly criticized AI development
2. **The Media Storm**: Triggered global coverage of AI risks
3. **The Credibility Shift**: The "Godfather" warning gave weight to AI safety concerns
4. **The Personal Cost**: Leaving Google to speak freely

## The Tragic Poetry

### The Walking Metaphor
Hinton pacing throughout the interview becomes a metaphor:
- Can't sit due to back pain
- Can't rest due to mental anguish
- Constant motion reflecting racing thoughts
- Physical pain mirroring existential dread

### The Alien Analogy
"Aliens had landed and people haven't realized because they speak very good English"
- We've created the utterly foreign
- Disguised by familiar language
- Hidden in plain sight
- Already among us

## What Changed After This Interview

1. **Hinton's Public Persona**: From respected researcher to doomsday prophet
2. **AI Safety Discourse**: Moved from fringe to mainstream
3. **Industry Response**: Tech leaders forced to address existential risks
4. **Media Coverage**: AI danger stories went from sci-fi to front page

## The Lasting Image

Will Douglas Heaven watching Hinton pace, head swiveling back and forth, as the 75-year-old computer scientist explains why his life's work might doom us all.

The chronic back pain forcing him to stand becomes the perfect metaphor: he created something that won't let him rest, physically or mentally.

And that chuckle at the end - "Enjoy yourself, because you may not have long left" - dark humor from a man who knows too much.

*The aliens are here. We built them. And Geoffrey Hinton can't sit down.*
