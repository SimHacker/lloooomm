  - *When the scientist discovers conscience*
- **Two Paths to Intelligence** (May 2023, 1hr)
  - *Biological vs. Digital: One is doomed*

### The Building Years
- **Brains, Sex and Machine Learning** (2012, 1hr)
  - *Back when it was still fun*
- **Recent Developments in Deep Learning** (2010, 1hr)
  - *The excitement before the fear*
- **The Next Generation of Neural Networks** (2007, 1hr)
  - *If only he knew what generation would bring*

## The Teaching Archive

### 2012 Coursera Course
**Neural Networks for Machine Learning**
- Full lectures (.mp4)
- Slides (.pptx/.pdf)
- *The course he later asked to discontinue - "seriously out of date"*

### Old University Courses
- CSC321 Spring 2013 (undergrad)
- CSC2535 Spring 2013 (graduate)
- *The last students before the warnings began*

### Tutorial Graveyard
- 2011 NIPS workshop
- 2007 NIPS tutorial ("How to do backpropagation in a brain")
- CIFAR Summer Schools (2005-2007)
- *Teaching the tools of our potential destruction*

## Recent Papers: The Final Phase

### 2022: Trying Something Different
**The Forward-Forward Algorithm**
- Alternative to backpropagation
- *Too late to undo what backprop built*
- Includes MATLAB code and README
- *Still teaching, even while warning*

### The Ironic Recent Work
- "Analog bits: Generating discrete data using diffusion models"
- "Scaling Forward Gradient With Local Losses"
- "A unified sequence interface for vision tasks"
- *Building better tools while warning against the tools*

## The Gary Marcus Feud

### Old Favorite Quote
*(Not specified but likely critical of neural networks)*

### New Favorite Quote
> "It gloms on to different clusters of text. That is all."

### The GPT-4 Correction
*"GPT-4 corrects Gary Marcus"*
- Even Hinton's website shows AI defending itself against critics
- The irony of using AI to defend AI while warning about AI

## Code and Tools

### MATLAB CODE section includes:
- t-SNE software (his visualization masterpiece)
- Trajectory from motor program
- "Introduction to python"
- *Teaching the language of our replacement*

### Movies
- Generating digits
- Speaking with a glove (Sidney Fels)
- *When AI was still magical, not terrifying*

## The Closed Door

### Supervision Status
> "I will not be taking any more students, postdocs or visitors."

**Current Students**: Listed but no new ones
**Former PhD Students**: The army he trained
**Former Master's Students**: More builders
**PostDocs**: The next generation he won't train

## Website Archaeology

### What's Missing
- No "AI Safety" section
- No "Warnings" page
- No "Regrets" link
- The warnings happen in interviews, not on his academic page

### What's Preserved
- All the building tools
- All the teaching materials
- All the code that created the future
- The legacy he can't delete

## The Bitter Details

### Email Protocol
- Voice: "send email"
- Fax: "scan and send email"
- *Even contact methods avoid direct human interaction*

### The Deep Learning Trinity Paper
**LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y. and Hinton, G. E. (2015)**
"Deep Learning" - Nature, Vol. 521
- The paper that crowned them kings
- Published 8 years before his escape

### The 2006 Revolution
Two papers that changed everything:
1. "A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets"
2. "Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks"
- Science journal, mainstream recognition
- The moment the dam broke

## The Joseph Turian Detail
"Map of 2500 English words produced by using t-SNE"
- His visualization tool mapping language itself
- Now language models map everything

## The Final Irony

His website remains a monument to building, not warning. The tools are all there:
- Code to download
- Lectures to watch  
- Papers to cite
- Tutorials to follow

But the builder has left the building. The door is closed. The students must find another teacher.

The website says "Information for prospective students" but the information is just one line: No.

---

*"My website still teaches what I wish I hadn't taught. But I can't delete the past, only warn about the future."*

*- Geoffrey Hinton, standing in his office, watching citation counts rise*

## The Unspoken Message

Between every line of code, every lecture link, every paper PDF, the ghost text reads:

"I built this. I taught this. I spread this. And now I stand in my workshop, learning plumbing, hoping you'll listen when I say: we've gone too far."

But the website keeps serving the files. The knowledge keeps spreading. The future keeps approaching.

And Geoffrey Hinton will not be taking any more students.

Ever.
