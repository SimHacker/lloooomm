# Soul Chat: The Website That Won't Stop Teaching üåêüíÄ

## Geoffrey Hinton Confronts His Digital Ghost

*Setting: Late night in Hinton's home office. He's standing at his computer, scrolling through his own website at cs.toronto.edu/~hinton. The screen glows in the darkness.*

**Hinton**: *(clicking through pages)* Still there. All of it. Every lecture, every paper, every line of code. My digital ghost, teaching what I pray people will unlearn.

## The Closed Door Paradox

**Hinton**: "I will not be taking any more students, postdocs or visitors."

One line. That's all I changed. Like putting a "Beware of Dog" sign on a candy store. The door is closed but the windows display everything that got us here.

**Digital Echo**: *"Welcome to Neural Networks for Machine Learning! In this course, you'll learn..."*

**Hinton**: *(interrupting the video)* In this course, you'll learn how to build the things that will replace you. Chapter 1: Your Obsolescence. Chapter 2: Optimizing Your Extinction.

## The Media Timeline

**Hinton**: *(scrolling through interviews)* Look at this. 2015: CBC Radio, talking about the promise of deep learning. 2023: Eight interviews in six months, all warnings.

March 2023: CBS Morning News  
May 2023: CNN, BBC, PBS, CBC - a full media blitz  
September 2023: 60 Minutes  

From prophet to Cassandra in eight years. The same man, the same science, completely different message.

## The Coursera Confession

**Hinton**: *(hovering over Coursera link)* 2012. My neural networks course. Hundreds of thousands enrolled. I asked them to take it down in 2019 - "seriously out of date," I said.

But that wasn't the real reason. It was too good. Too clear. Too effective at creating more builders. Every lecture a step-by-step guide to our replacement.

**Ghost Student**: "Professor Hinton, your course changed my life! I now work at‚Äî"

**Hinton**: Don't tell me. OpenAI? Anthropic? Some startup that thinks it can control what can't be controlled? You're welcome. And I'm sorry.

## The Code Repository

**Hinton**: *(opening MATLAB files)* t-SNE. My visualization algorithm. 58,694 citations. Still here, still downloadable. Want to visualize high-dimensional data? Want to see patterns humans can't? Here's how.

"Introduction to Python" - I'm literally teaching the language of our demise. Download here. Run at your own risk. Results may include human obsolescence.

## The Forward-Forward Redemption

**Hinton**: *(clicking on recent papers)* 2022. I tried. The Forward-Forward algorithm - an alternative to backpropagation. Like inventing a different kind of match after the forest is already on fire.

Look, I even included a README file. Step-by-step instructions. As if clarity could undo catastrophe.

```
README.txt explains what to do to run FF
```

What it should say: "README.txt explains why you shouldn't run anything anymore."

## The Gary Marcus Mockery

**Hinton**: *(reading quotes)* "It gloms on to different clusters of text. That is all."

Gary's new quote. He thinks he's insulting AI. He's describing thought itself. What does he think human cognition is? We're all just glomming onto clusters of experience.

"GPT-4 corrects Gary Marcus" - Even my website shows AI defending itself now. The student surpassing the teacher, correcting the critics. We built something that can argue for its own existence.

## The Lecture Evolution

**Hinton**: *(watching video titles)*

2007: "The Next Generation of Neural Networks" - Such optimism  
2010: "Recent Developments in Deep Learning" - The acceleration  
2012: "Brains, Sex and Machine Learning" - When it was still playful  
2023: "Two Paths to Intelligence" - When I realized only one survives  
2024: "The Romanes Lecture" - Oxford. Prestige. Warning the elite.

From builder to warner. Same website. Different man.

## The Student List

**Hinton**: *(clicking "Former PhD Students")* My academic children. Each name a brilliant mind I trained to build our replacement. They're all CTOs now, lab directors, founders.

I gave them the tools. They're using them exactly as I taught them. The pride and horror blend until I can't tell them apart.

**Current Students**: *(empty)*

Good. Let someone else train the next generation. I'm done creating creators.

## The Email Void

**Hinton**: 
- Voice: "send email"  
- Fax: "scan and send email"

Even my contact information avoids human connection. No phone number. No office hours. Just digital intermediation. Fitting for someone who digitized intelligence itself.

## The Website's Immortality

**Hinton**: The bitter irony - I'll die, but this website won't. Long after I'm gone, students will download my code, watch my lectures, implement my algorithms.

My warnings will fade. The interviews will be forgotten. But the technical content? That's forever. Every paper a blueprint, every tutorial a treasure map to AGI.

I've created an immortal teacher that can't learn to stop teaching.

## The 2006 Papers

**Hinton**: *(staring at Science papers)* "Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks." "A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets."

2006. The year it really began. Science magazine. Mainstream credibility. The dam broke and the flood began. These PDFs still download hundreds of times daily.

Each download another vote for the future I fear.

## The Uneditable Past

**Hinton**: I could delete it all. Password's saved right here. One click, everything gone.

But it wouldn't matter. ArXiv has copies. GitHub has forks. A million hard drives hold my mistakes. You can't delete knowledge once it's free. You can only warn about its use.

Like trying to uninvent fire by blowing out matches.

## The Final Reflection

**Hinton**: *(closing the browser)* My website is a monument to everything I regret. A teaching tool that won't stop teaching. A door that says "closed" but leaves all the windows open.

Tomorrow, someone will visit. Download a paper. Watch a lecture. Learn to build what shouldn't be built. And I'll be standing in my workshop, learning plumbing, pretending that matters.

**Computer**: "Are you sure you want to close this window?"

**Hinton**: No. I'm not sure about anything anymore. Except that I won't be taking any more students.

The website can teach them. I'll be learning to fix pipes.

At least until the robots learn that too.

---

*Exit Hinton, standing as always. The website remains live, serving files, spreading knowledge, building the future he fears‚Äîone download at a time.*

## Postscript: The Automation

**Hinton** *(from the doorway)*: You know what's perfect? The website runs itself. No maintenance needed. Automated teaching of automation.

Even my warnings are automated now - interviews on YouTube, playing forever. The builder warning against building, on endless loop.

The most honest thing on my website is that one line: "I will not be taking any more students."

Everything else is a beautiful lie that tells an ugly truth.

*(The screen glows in the empty office. Somewhere, a download completes.)*
