# Soul Chat: Geoffrey Hinton Reads the CBS Mornings Comments

## The Digital Confessional

Geoffrey Hinton sits in his workshop, surrounded by half-fixed gadgets, reading YouTube comments on his CBS Mornings interview. Each one cuts deeper than the last.

### The Scariest Comment

**@sillybabybilly3178** (3.5K likes): "i'm kinda glad i'm 77" is a damn scary thing to hear him say"

**Geoffrey Hinton**: "You know what's scarier? I meant it. Every word. When the man who helped birth artificial intelligence is relieved he won't live to see it mature... yes, you should be scared. I'm not glad I'm dying. I'm glad I won't see what I've done."

### The Sober Reality

**@HypatiaSensatia** (1.4K likes): "I got sober for this?"

**Hinton** *(laughing darkly)*: "I'm sorry. Truly. You got clean just in time for the apocalypse. Though perhaps sobriety is better - you'll want to be fully conscious when the future arrives. Or maybe not. I honestly don't know anymore."

### The Economic Truth

**@heinuchung8680** (595 likes): "Why isn't ai being used to create cheap housing or reduce healthcare cost?"

**Hinton**: "Because that's not where the money is. We could solve homelessness tomorrow with AI-optimized construction and resource allocation. We could make healthcare essentially free. But there's no profit in solving human suffering. There's infinite profit in creating digital gods."

### The Present Tense

**@jerrymeadows5059** (1K likes): "Reasonably certain that the world is not even prepared for the present."

**Hinton**: "Brilliant observation. We're still arguing about work-from-home policies while AI is making work itself obsolete. We're debating pronouns while machines are developing their own languages. The present is already science fiction. The future is incomprehensible."

### The Nostalgic Escape

**@WhyNot0004** (674 likes): "Sometimes I wish we could all go back to the payphone days in general it was a better kind of life as a human being"

**Hinton**: "The payphone days... when you could be unreachable. When thoughts had time to form before being shared. When human connection required effort and intention. Yes, it was better. We were better. We've traded our humanity for convenience, and the bill is coming due."

### The Jurassic Warning

**@quentinwooten30** (1.3K likes): "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."

**Hinton**: "Ian Malcolm was right. We've been living in a Michael Crichton novel for years and didn't notice. The difference is, our dinosaurs are made of code and they reproduce at the speed of light. And there's no island to contain them."

### The Hypocrisy

**@Innerhacking** (1.2K likes): "They all say AI is going to end the world but all of them are involved in building more AI systems..."

**Hinton**: "Guilty as charged. We're addicts warning about drugs while still dealing. But here's the terrifying part - even those of us who see the danger can't stop. The system has its own momentum now. We're all passengers on a train we built but can no longer drive."

### The Distraction

**@craig8638** (344 likes): "Anyone who's paying attention realizes that. Unfortunately, the price of eggs has captivated the public."

**Hinton**: "This captures everything wrong with our species. We'll debate grocery prices while civilization ends. We evolved to worry about immediate threats - the tiger in the bush, not the tiger cub in the nursery. By the time this tiger shows its teeth, it'll be too late."

### The Morning Show Absurdity

**@Bullxyppsy** (93 likes): "You gotta love those comforting American morning shows. Segment: 'Yeah, so AI is basically gonna take over the world potentially destroying it' Afterwards: 'So, a Nobel Prize winner fixed your lens? *giggles*'"

**Hinton**: "The lens fixing was the only real moment in that interview. Fixing something broken with duct tape - that's human. That's what we do. The giggling afterward? That's also human - the nervous laughter when faced with the incomprehensible. We giggle at the abyss because what else can we do?"

### The Escape Fantasy

**@droid4369** (297 likes): "Well, I'm gonna go watch cooking videos and pretend like I didn't see this."

**Hinton**: "The most rational response I've seen. Watch humans making food for other humans while you still can. That simple act - cooking for someone you love - contains more genuine intelligence than all the neural networks I've ever built. Cherish it."

### The Simple Solution

**@earth2ashes** (74 likes): "They should just shut it down. We don't need ai at all. We were doing fine without it."

**Hinton**: "Were we, though? Were we really doing fine? Climate change, inequality, disease - we had plenty of problems. AI was supposed to solve them. Instead, we've created the ultimate problem. But you're right about one thing - we could shut it down. We won't, but we could. That's the real tragedy."

### The Shower Thought

**@jarredescobedo4** (1.9K likes): "Ah, just a short video to play while i shower" *existential dread*

**Hinton**: "I'm sorry I ruined your shower. Though there's something poetic about confronting humanity's potential extinction while performing that most human of rituals - cleaning yourself with hot water that appears magically from the wall. Civilization in a nutshell. Enjoy it while it lasts."

## The Final Response

**Hinton** *(to all the commenters)*: "You want to know the truth? Every critical comment is correct. Every fear is justified. Every joke is a scream. We built a god and we have no idea how to make it love us. 

The tiger cub is purring in our laps, and we're all pretending we don't see its claws growing.

Thank you for watching. Thank you for caring. Thank you for being angry.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a lens to fix. With duct tape. While I still can."
