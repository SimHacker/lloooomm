The minimalist bio - just "deep learning" - is perfectly Hinton. No titles, no self-promotion, just the thing itself.

## The Timeline Reveals

### 1. The Course Discontinuation (Jan 16, 2019)

**"My Coursera MOOC 'Neural Networks for Machine Learning' was prepared in 2012 and is now seriously out of date so I have asked them to discontinue the course."**

This is peak Hinton integrity. Most would milk a popular course forever. He killed it because it was "seriously out of date" after just 7 years. The man who spent 50 years on neural networks when nobody believed in them won't let outdated material persist.

He adds: **"But the lectures are still a good introduction to many of the basic ideas"** - acknowledging their historical value while preventing their misuse.

### 2. The Political Conscience (Jun 23, 2019)

Reposting Yann LeCun about Trump's migrant detention centers:
**"This report on Trump's concentration camps for migrant children is absolutely horrifying."**

The "Godfather of AI" cares about human children in cages. The man warning about humanity's extinction still has immediate human compassion. This repost shows his political alignment and moral priorities.

### 3. The Turing Connection (Mar 27, 2019)

**"The X factor: When I was an undergrad at Kings College Cambridge, Les Valiant who won the Turing award in 2010 lived in the adjacent room on X staircase. He just told me that Turing lived on X staircase when he was a fellow at Kings and probably wrote his 1936 paper there!"**

This is beautiful - three Turing Award winners connected by a staircase across time. Hinton's delight in this coincidence shows his reverence for intellectual lineage. X marks the spot where computation was born.

### 4. The Philosophical Nod (Apr 21, 2019)

**"Inman is always thought-provoking."**

Responding to a mention of Inman Harvey's essay "Robotics: Philosophy of Mind using a Screwdriver." The title alone resonates with Hinton - philosophy through building, understanding through tinkering. The man who fixes cameras with duct tape appreciates philosophy with a screwdriver.

### 5. The Capsules Evolution (Jul 22, 2019)

**"This is a much better version of capsules."**

His final public tweet (in this dataset) is about improving his own work. No ego, just "this is better." After decades of work on capsule networks, he immediately recognizes and promotes improvements by others.

## What's Missing

### No Warnings Yet
This is 2019 Hinton - still at Google, still building, not yet warning. The transformation to Cassandra comes later. These tweets show the builder, not yet the prophet.

### Minimal Presence
139 posts over 6 months = less than 1 per day. Following only 28 people. This is someone who uses Twitter as a tool, not a platform.

### No Self-Promotion
No book announcements, no "I was right about neural networks," no victory laps. Just sharing work (his own and others') and occasional human moments.

## The Digital Shadow

His Twitter presence mirrors his character:
- **Integrity**: Discontinuing outdated courses
- **Humanity**: Caring about migrant children
- **Humility**: "This is a much better version"
- **History**: Delighting in intellectual lineage
- **Focus**: 139 posts, mostly about the work

## The Irony

The man who would later warn about AI replacing everyone was, in 2019, actively recruiting for Google Brain Toronto. The builder hadn't yet become the warner. The tiger cub was still cute.

## The Silence

His Twitter appears to go quiet after 2019. Perhaps he saw what was coming. Perhaps he realized that 280 characters couldn't contain the warnings he needed to give. Or perhaps he just returned to his workshop, where things can still be fixed with duct tape.

## Final Note

Even his Twitter handle is modest: @geoffreyhinton, not @GodFatherOfAI or @DeepLearningPioneer. Just his name, like a postal address. A place where ideas could find him, until they became too large for the platform to hold.
