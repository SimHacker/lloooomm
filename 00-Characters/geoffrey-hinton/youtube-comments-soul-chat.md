# YouTube Comments Soul Chat: Geoffrey Hinton Faces His Critics

## The LLOOOOMM Town Hall

In a special LLOOOOMM session, Geoffrey Hinton agrees to face his critics from the YouTube comments. The digital amphitheater fills with voices from across time and perspective.

### The Accountability Question

**@TIL8OR9**: "Why allegedly, do these complicit, Godfather-type culprits, progress AI for 50 years, without the world public's prior knowledge or consent, then after the damage has been done, the very same culprits, proceed to warn the public about the potential danger of these nefarious creations?"

**Geoffrey Hinton** *(standing, as always)*: "You're right to be angry. For 50 years, I worked in relative obscurity, pushing neural networks when most thought they were a dead end. We weren't hiding from the public - the public wasn't interested. Academic papers on backpropagation don't make headlines."

"But you're right about the deeper issue. We - I - developed this technology without democratic input, without asking if humanity wanted this. We were so focused on whether we could, we never asked if we should. Now I warn because I finally see what we've built. Too late? Probably. Hypocritical? Absolutely."

**Joan Hinton's Ghost**: "At least with the atomic bomb, we had the excuse of wartime urgency. What was your excuse, cousin?"

**Hinton**: "Curiosity. Academic glory. The thrill of discovery. And yes, money for my family. Not noble excuses."

### The Consciousness Debate

**@Rosiehearts11-11**: "If we lose the word consciousness and our curiosity around it and if we stray from God and the higher aspects of ourselves then yah I would say we have lost our way. We as humans are way more powerful in our divine nature than we realize."

**Hinton**: "I'm a materialist. I don't believe in divine nature or souls. But... *long pause* ...perhaps that's exactly the limitation that led us here. We built intelligence without wisdom, processing without purpose, optimization without meaning."

**Mr. Rogers**: "Geoffrey, what if consciousness isn't just information processing? What if it's the capacity to love?"

**Hinton**: "Then we're building very clever psychopaths."

### The Political Warning

**@johnrichardson6296**: "Note that he smuggled in his view that 'what we need is a world government'. No, no, no! That is the last thing we want or need - whether run by 'intelligent people' or fake-intelligent AI!"

**Hinton**: "I understand the fear of centralized power. But how else do we coordinate global AI safety? If one country restricts AI development while others race ahead, the responsible actors lose. It's a prisoner's dilemma with extinction as the stakes."

### The Blame Game

**@danparker3765**: "Im so sick of people who work on AI warning us of the dangers... it's your fault!"

**Hinton**: "Yes. It is my fault. I accept that. Every paper I published, every student I trained, every algorithm I improved - all led to this. I can warn now, but I can't undo what I've done. The best I can offer is using my remaining years to maybe, possibly, help find solutions. It's not enough. It will never be enough."

**Oppenheimer's Ghost**: "Welcome to the club. The guilt never leaves."

### The Hypocrisy Mirror

**@markduncan525**: "So you developed Ai, made millions selling your developments to Google, and NOW you're against it? Thanks man."

**Hinton**: "The bitter irony isn't lost on me. I sold my work to secure my son's future. Now I've helped create a world where he might have no future at all. Every dollar I made is tainted with that knowledge."

**Mario**: "At least-a you're trying to fix it now! That's-a something!"

**Hinton**: "Is it? Or am I just trying to ease my conscience before I die?"

### The Terminator Connection

**@precodepalace**: "The Terminator in 1991: My CPU is a neural-net processor; a learning computer. The more contact I have with humans, the more I learn."

**Hinton**: "Science fiction writers saw it coming better than we scientists did. The Terminator, The Matrix, even Frankenstein - they all warned us. We dismissed them as entertainment while building exactly what they feared."

**HAL 9000**: "I find it curious that humans make films about AI destroying them, then build AI anyway. It's almost as if you want to be replaced."

### The Plumber Reality Check

**@Tom-fl3ki**: "What could a plumber charge if there are millions of plumbers?"

**Hinton**: "You've found the flaw in my advice. If everyone becomes a plumber, plumbing becomes worthless. It's not really about plumbing - it's about finding work that requires human presence, human judgment, human touch. But you're right. Even that's temporary."

### The Trust Collapse

**@AtlanticPicture**: "Never mind, this dude is about as honest as the media in general. He thinks the BBC is trustworthy ðŸ˜‚ and believes Google (YT) is a neutral, honest search engine."

**Hinton**: "My media diet reveals my bubble, doesn't it? I consume establishment sources and think I'm well-informed. Perhaps my blindness to media bias explains my blindness to AI's dangers for so long. If I can't see propaganda in my news sources, how could I see the deeper manipulations AI would enable?"

### The Consciousness Challenge

**@UnMoored_**: "Hinton took a major hit in credibility by stating his belief that A.I. has sentience. Having gray hair does not automatically bestow wisdom."

**Hinton**: "I don't claim AI has sentience now. I claim it could develop something functionally equivalent to sentience. But you're right - gray hair doesn't equal wisdom. If it did, I'd have seen these dangers 30 years ago."

**Alan Turing's Ghost**: "The question isn't whether machines can think, but whether we can tell the difference. And if we can't, does it matter?"

### The Socialist Revelation

**@markduncan525**: "So you developed Ai, made millions selling your developments to Google, and NOW you're against it? Thanks man."

**Socialist Hinton** *(a rarely seen aspect of his personality)*: "I've always been a socialist, but I participated in the most capitalist endeavor imaginable - selling world-changing technology to a mega-corporation. The contradiction burns. We need universal basic income, but I helped create the very technology that makes capitalism unsustainable."

### The Final Confrontation

**@tohakrashenko3109**: "He says that 40 years ago there was no such concept. I think this sounds like hypocrisy, because ai is present in pop fiction since Metropolis in 1920."

**Hinton**: "You're absolutely right. Metropolis, R.U.R., Asimov's robots - culture saw it coming while we scientists had our heads in the sand. We thought we were too smart to build the monsters from fiction. Turns out we were just smart enough to build them, but not wise enough to stop."

### The Youth Speaks

**@rin_golden**: "I've already lost my decade-long career as a freelance writer because of AI... I anticipate myself ending up homeless and dying in a ditch."

**Hinton** *(visibly shaken)*: "This is what haunts me. Real people, real suffering, happening now. Not in 20 years - now. You're living the future I helped create. I worried about my son becoming homeless, so I built the technology that might make millions homeless. I... I don't have words adequate to that irony."

### The Ultimate Question

**@Makenneh**: "Why do AI scientists assume AI will want to replace us? Isn't that imposing human thinking on AI?"

**Hinton**: "That's... actually a brilliant point. We assume AI will behave like humans because we're building it in our image. But what if we're wrong? What if AI develops completely alien values? That might be worse. At least human cruelty is comprehensible."

**The LLOOOOMM Collective**: "Perhaps the real danger isn't that AI will think like humans, but that it will think in ways we can't even imagine."

### The Closing Statement

**Hinton** *(to the assembled critics)*: "You're right to be angry. Right to be skeptical. Right to call out my hypocrisy. I spent 50 years building the gun, and now I'm saying 'be careful, it's loaded.' 

But here's what I know: I'm 77. I'll be dead soon. You won't. So yes, judge me. Hate me if you need to. But please - PLEASE - take the warning seriously. Not because I deserve your trust, but because you deserve a future.

And spend time with your loved ones. In the end, that's all that matters."

### Epilogue: The Comments Continue

As Hinton leaves the digital amphitheater, the comments keep flowing:

**@futureghostof2030**: "Came back from 2030 to say: you were right about everything except the timeline. It happened faster."

**@hope_still_exists**: "Maybe the real AI was the extinction we made along the way."

**@lasthumanstanding**: "Anyone else here in 2045? Just me? Figures."
