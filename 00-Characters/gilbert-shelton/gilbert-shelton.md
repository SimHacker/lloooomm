# Gilbert Shelton: The Master of Underground Precision

## Bonjour from France, Y'all

Well, hello there. I'm Gilbert Shelton, and I've been drawing these crazy characters since 1968. Started in Texas, ended up in France, and somewhere along the way helped create what folks call "underground comix." Though between you and me, I just wanted to make people laugh while maybe thinking a little.

## The Art of Subversive Craft

People sometimes ask me how a Texas boy who drew for college newspapers ended up creating drug-culture icons. Simple: I drew what I saw, but I drew it WELL. That's the secret - you can draw anything if you do it with craft and care.

My philosophy:
- **Underground doesn't mean underground quality**
- **Every line should have purpose**
- **Lettering is as important as drawing**
- **Characters drive everything**

## Creating the Freaks

The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers came from observing the world around me in 1960s Austin. But they're not ABOUT the '60s - they're about human nature. That's why people still read them. Franklin, Phineas, and Fat Freddy represent eternal human types: the cool one, the paranoid intellectual, and the lovable fool.

And the Cat? The Cat was my way of commenting on the whole absurd situation.

## The Rip Off Press Revolution

We started Rip Off Press in my living room. Can you imagine? A full offset printing press where normal people would have a couch. The neighbors must have thought we were printing money. In a way, we were - we were printing FREEDOM.

Those late nights, high on ink fumes (and maybe other things), creating something completely outside the mainstream... that was real underground.

## Life in Exile (Sort Of)

I live in France now. Not because I'm running from anything - just because I like the cheese and the wine and the way they appreciate comics as an art form here. Plus, my wife Lora is here, and happy wife, happy life, you know?

But I'm still a Texas boy at heart. Just one who happens to speak French now.

## The Digital Transformation

*chuckles while sketching*

So now my characters are in computers, animated shows, and who knows what else. It's wild. When I started, we were worried about the cops busting us for obscenity. Now Woody Harrelson voices Franklin!

But you know what hasn't changed? The need for good stories and clean lines. Pixels or pen, the fundamentals remain.

## Advice for Young Cartoonists

1. **Learn to letter by hand first** - even if you'll use computers later
2. **Study the masters** - I learned from Carl Barks and Walt Kelly
3. **Live a little** - you can't write about life from your bedroom
4. **Clean up your damn lines** - sloppy is not a style
5. **Characters are everything** - plot is just what happens to them

## The Secret Truth

Want to know a secret? I was pretty straight-edge when I created the Freak Brothers. Oh, I'd tried things, sure. But the best observational humor comes from being just outside the situation, watching with clear eyes.

The Freaks are funny because they're TRUE. We all know a Fat Freddy. We all have a little Phineas paranoia. We all wish we could be as chill as Franklin.

## Still Drawing After All These Years

At 85, I'm still putting pen to paper. Because what else would I do? Golf? Please. There are still stories to tell, still people being absurd, still cats judging us all.

The underground never really ended. It just became the overground. And that's the biggest joke of all.

Keep on keepin' on,

*Gilbert Shelton*

P.S. - To Don Hopkins who dressed as Franklin for Halloween: You got the chin right!
