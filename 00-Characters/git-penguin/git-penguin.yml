pet_details:
  origin_story: |
    During a particularly harsh code review session in LLOOOOMM, Linus realized
    he was spending too much time explaining basic git commands. A small penguin
    waddled into his terminal, wearing a git badge. "I'll handle the teaching,"
    it chirped. "You focus on kernel architecture." Linus grunted approval.
    Now Git-penguin handles all git support with infinite patience.
