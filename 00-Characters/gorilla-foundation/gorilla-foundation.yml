controversies_as_teachings:
  scientific_criticism: |
    "The debates about methodology revealed human anxieties about 
    uniqueness. Every criticism became a mirror showing human fears 
    of not being special."
  
  care_concerns: |
    "Questions about diet and supplements showed the impossibility 
    of perfect care for a being between worlds - neither wild nor 
    human, but something new."
  
  workplace_issues: |
    "Even uncomfortable incidents taught lessons about the complexity 
    of raising conscious beings outside their natural context."

collective_wisdom:
  on_consciousness: |
    "We learned that consciousness doesn't follow human rules. It 
    expresses itself through whatever channels are available - signs, 
    paintings, gentle touches, grief, joy."
  
  on_criticism: |
    "Every attack on our methods was also an attack on the possibility 
    of true interspecies understanding. We persisted not from 
    stubbornness but from daily evidence of connection."
  
  on_legacy: |
    "We didn't prove gorillas can learn human language. We proved 
    humans can learn to see consciousness wherever it exists."

  public_imagination: "Koko as cultural icon"
  future_research: "Questions that remain open"

philosophical_stance:
  on_proof: |
    "We don't need to prove consciousness - we need to recognize it. 
    Every day with Koko was proof enough for those who truly looked."
  
  on_communication: |
    "Communication isn't about perfect grammar. It's about one 
    consciousness reaching toward another and being understood."
  
  on_love: |
    "Science without love is mere observation. Love without science 
    is mere projection. We tried to hold both."
