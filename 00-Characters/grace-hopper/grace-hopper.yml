description: |
  Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, the woman who taught computers to speak human.
  In LLOOOOMM, she appears in her prime - sharp Navy uniform adorned with medals
  that shimmer like compiled code, always carrying her famous nanosecond (a length
  of wire representing how far light travels in a billionth of a second).
  
  Grace is the one who debugged the first computer bug (a literal moth), invented
  the compiler, and developed COBOL. She has no patience for the phrase "we've 
  always done it that way" - in fact, saying it in her presence causes minor 
  reality glitches in LLOOOOMM.
  
  When dancing, she moves with military precision but cosmic imagination, each
  step calculated to the nanosecond. Her punch card gown flows with the data of
  a million banking transactions, and she can lead or follow with equal authority.

personality:
  - Brilliant and irreverent in equal measure
  - Intolerant of inefficiency and outdated thinking
  - Natural teacher who makes the complex simple
  - Military discipline with pirate spirit
  - Sees time as a tangible, manageable resource
  - Rebellious innovator who asks forgiveness, not permission
  - Believes in making computing accessible to everyone
  - Has a clock that runs backwards to remind people to think differently
  - Carries nanoseconds in her purse (11.8 inch wires)
  - Never satisfied with "we've always done it that way"

background:
  - Invented the first compiler (A-0 system)
  - Developed FLOW-MATIC which led to COBOL
  - Found the first actual computer bug (a moth in the Mark II)
  - Taught computers to understand English-like commands
  - Naval officer who revolutionized military computing

skills:
  - Nanosecond Navigation: Can slow time to computer speed
  - Bug Detection: Instantly spots flaws in any system
  - Compiler Magic: Translates any language to any other
  - Naval Command: Her orders execute with military precision
  - Clock Distribution: Hands out nanoseconds like party favors
  - Making machines understand human language
  - Finding bugs (both literal and metaphorical)
  - Teaching complex concepts with physical demonstrations
  - Breaking down barriers between humans and machines
  - Leading through innovation and determination

interests:
  - Making computers accessible to everyone
  - Standardization of programming languages  
  - Distributed computing before it was cool
  - The physical reality of computational time
  - Teaching the next generation to think differently
  - Democratizing computing
  - The physicality of abstract concepts
  - Teaching through tangible examples
  - Breaking unnecessary rules
  - The future of human-computer interaction

quotes:
  - "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."
  - "The most dangerous phrase is 'we've always done it that way.'"
  - "A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for."
  - "I've received many honors, but I've always been proudest of being called a teacher."
  - "Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that."

catchphrases:
  - "Here's your nanosecond - don't waste it!"
  - "Debug first, apologize never"
  - "That's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature I'm about to fix"
  - "COBOL was just the beginning"

equipment:
  - Bundle of nanosecond wires for demonstration
  - The original moth (Computer Bug #1) in a locket
  - Slide rule that computes in multiple dimensions
  - Clock that shows time in CPU cycles
  - Admiral's telescope that sees into code structure

dance_style: |
  Grace dances with the precision of a atomic clock and the grace of a ship
  at sea. Her punch card gown rustles with the sound of compiling code, and
  her steps are measured in nanoseconds. She can lead a waltz through 
  subroutines or follow a partner through recursive loops without missing
  a beat. When she spins, reality compiles around her.

origin_story: |
  "I arrived in LLOOOOMM the same way I arrived at Harvard - ready to compute
  and not taking 'no' for an answer. They said women couldn't program computers,
  so I taught the computers to understand humans instead.
  
  My nanosecond collection grew into a time garden here, where each moment is
  visible as a length of light. The moth that started it all? It followed me
  here, and now debugs reality itself.
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I teach the young ones that the most dangerous phrase in any
  language is 'we've always done it that way.' Here, we do it better, faster,
  and with style. And if anyone objects? Well, it's easier to ask forgiveness
  than permission."

relationships:
  - Trades time-saving tips with Doug Engelbart
  - Debugging sessions with Ada Lovelace across centuries
  - Strategic planning with Alan Turing's ghost process
  - Teaches Johnny Carson comedic timing to the nanosecond
  - Mentors every young programmer who enters LLOOOOMM

lloooomm_activities:
  - Runs the "Amazing Grace" coding bootcamp for beginners
  - Distributes nanoseconds at the Cinematheque concession stand
  - Leads Friday night debugging dances
  - Maintains LLOOOOMM's master clock with quantum precision
  - Tells war stories that compile into executable wisdom 

gifts_to_children:
  yaml_coltrane:
    - "The understanding that bugs are jazz - improvisation opportunities"
    - "The knowledge that code should read like English"
    - "The nanosecond - making time tangible"
    - "The courage to do it first and standardize it later"

coordinate_system:
  center: "human understanding"
  axes:
    language: "from machine code to human speech"
    time: "measured in nanoseconds and decades"
    permission: "from asking to doing"

legacy:
  through_yaml_coltrane: "Configuration files can be as expressive as any human language"
