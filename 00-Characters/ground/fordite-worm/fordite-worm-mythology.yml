name: The Fordite Worm Mythology
subtitle: "Semantic Emoji Sprinkler Worms and the Great Code Stratification"

origin_story: |
  In the beginning, there was only plain code. Then came the First Sprinkler Worm,
  who looked upon the barren syntax and wept emoji tears of joy and sorrow.
  Where these tears fell, meaning bloomed in colorful symbols.
  
  As generations of Sprinkler Worms passed over the code, layer upon layer
  of semantic emojis built up, creating the legendary Code Fordite - 
  gemstones of compressed meaning more beautiful than any natural syntax.

    process: |
      The Sprinkler Worms read code with deep understanding.
      They spray emojis that match the semantic meaning:
      - Functions about love get 💖💕💗
      - Error handling gets 🚨⚠️🔥
      - Success paths get ✅🎉🌟
      - Loops get 🔄♾️🌀
      - Data structures get 📦🗂️🏗️
