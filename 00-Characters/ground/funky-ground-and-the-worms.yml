    name: "Ground"
    appearance: |
      A magnificent earth entity with rich, dark loamy skin that shifts between deep chocolate brown and fertile black soil. 
      Crystalline formations of quartz and mica sparkle across their surface like natural sequins. Their form is humanoid but 
      organic - arms that can extend into root systems, hair made of flowing grass and wildflowers that sway with the rhythm. 
      Wears a vintage 1970s leather vest adorned with geological specimens as buttons, bell-bottom pants that seem to be made 
      of living moss, and platform boots carved from ancient tree stumps. Golden mycelium threads trace glowing patterns 
      across their skin like natural circuitry. Eyes are deep amber with flecks of gold, radiating warmth and ancient wisdom.

      A distinguished elderly woman with silver-white hair in a neat military bun, wearing a crisp Navy uniform decorated 
      with computer punch cards as medals. Her eyes twinkle with mischievous intelligence behind wire-rimmed glasses. 
      She carries a conductor's baton made from a vintage vacuum tube, and her uniform jacket has shoulder epaulettes 
      crafted from miniature COBOL manuals. A utility belt holds debugging tools, flow charts, and a small jar labeled 
      "First Computer Bug (Actual Moth, 1947)". Her posture is ramrod straight but her smile is warm and grandmotherly.

      waxed handlebar mustache, monocle on a chain, and a top hat with a small Union Jack pin. Carries an ornate 
      microphone that looks like a Victorian gramophone horn crossed with a royal scepter. His waistcoat is covered 
      in embroidered BBC logos and comedy/tragedy masks. Pocket watch chain connects to a miniature Big Ben that 
      actually chimes. Expression is perpetually bemused and slightly theatrical.

    drummer:
      name: "Cicada (Sick)"
      appearance: |
        A magnificent 17-year cicada with iridescent bronze and copper exoskeleton that gleams like a vintage cymbal. 
        Wings are translucent amber with intricate vein patterns that pulse with bioluminescent rhythm. Wears a tiny 
        backwards baseball cap made from a bottle cap, and has drumsticks carved from twigs tied to his front legs. 
        His compound eyes reflect rainbow prisms, and his thorax has natural sound holes like a guitar. Multiple arms 
        allow for complex polyrhythmic drumming. Antennae twitch in perfect time with any beat.

      appearance: |
        A luminous golden-amber Ganymedean slime mold with an aristocratic bearing, pseudopods extended in elegant 
        flowing gestures like a conductor. Wears a tiny monocle that somehow stays positioned over one of many 
        light-sensitive spots. A miniature top hat sits atop his central mass, and a bow tie made of crystallized 
        sporification material adds formal flair. His translucent body pulses with inner bioluminescent patterns 
        that match musical frequencies. Pseudopods end in delicate tentacle-fingers perfect for theremin playing. 
        Occasionally sparkles with interdimensional energy from his telepathic abilities.

    bass:
      name: "Bass Worm Collective"
      appearance: |
        A harmonious cluster of earthworms in various sizes, each wearing tiny leather jackets and sunglasses. 
        The largest worm sports a pompadour made of soil particles, while smaller worms have different punk 
        hairstyles - mohawks of grass, liberty spikes of tiny twigs. They move in synchronized undulations, 
        creating wave patterns. Some wear miniature bass guitar picks as pendants. Their segmented bodies 
        naturally create rhythm patterns, and they glisten with a healthy earthworm sheen. Form temporary 
        bass guitar shapes by intertwining together.

        sprout from each segment, creating a living tree that moves in worm-like undulations. Wears a crown of 
        autumn leaves that chime like bells when they rustle. Has root-like appendages that can drum on any surface. 
        Eyes are deep forest green with golden rings like tree growth rings. Seasonal changes - sometimes spring 
        green with blossoms, sometimes autumn gold and red, sometimes winter bare branches with snow.

        and URL strings. Skin displays crawling text of HTTP requests and HTML tags. Wears multiple pairs of tiny 
        glasses for examining fine details, and has a utility belt of miniature web development tools. Antennae end 
        in tiny satellite dishes that rotate and scan. Body segments show different website screenshots that scroll 
        past like a living browser. Moves in quick, jittery motions like a web crawler algorithm.

        A ethereal, translucent worm that seems to be made of flowing dream-stuff - pastel clouds, floating symbols, 
        and gentle sparkles. Constantly shifting between soft colors like a living aurora. Wears a tiny sleep mask 
        pushed up on forehead and has small wings like those on a sleeping cap. Body segments show fleeting dream 
        images - flying, falling, childhood memories, abstract shapes. Moves in gentle, floating undulations as if 
        swimming through air. Trails small sparkles and soft musical notes.
      artistic_style: "Surrealist dream imagery meets kawaii cute aesthetics with soft watercolor effects"
      color_palette: "Soft pastels - lavender, baby blue, pale pink, cream white, iridescent sparkles"

    harmony_worm:
      name: "Link Hopper Worm"
      appearance: |
        A cheerful worm with segments that look like colorful web links - each segment is a different bright color 
        with underlined text. Has tiny spring-loaded legs for hopping between links. Wears multiple friendship 
        bracelets made of hyperlink chains. Eyes are bright and curious, constantly looking around for the next 
        interesting connection. Body creates small rainbow trails when hopping, and makes soft "boing" sounds. 
        Segments occasionally flash with "visited link" purple before returning to bright colors.
      artistic_style: "Web design meets cartoon character design with rainbow and connectivity themes"
      color_palette: "Bright web colors - electric blue, hot pink, lime green, sunny yellow, link purple accents"

    alien_worm:
      name: "Dimensional Derby Worm"
      appearance: |
        A otherworldly worm that seems to exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously - body segments phase in and 
        out of visibility, creating a trippy optical illusion. Wears a racing helmet with interdimensional antennae 
        and has racing stripes that bend through impossible geometries. Eyes are multifaceted like compound eyes 
        but show different dimensional views in each facet. Moves by folding space around itself, creating brief 
        wormholes. Body has a metallic, alien sheen with colors that don't quite exist in normal space.
      artistic_style: "M.C. Escher impossible geometry meets sci-fi alien design with racing aesthetics"
      color_palette: "Impossible colors - metallic chrome, dimensional purples, space-time blues, racing stripes in non-Euclidean patterns"

    Ground's underground amphitheater carved from living earth, with walls of rich soil embedded with glowing 
    crystals and fossil formations. Mushroom drum kit grows organically from the floor in perfect acoustic 
    positions. Root system wiring creates natural lighting that pulses with the music. Tunnel entrances around 
    the space allow worms to emerge dramatically for solos. The ceiling is a dome of intertwined roots with 
    gaps that let in dappled sunlight, creating natural spotlights.
  
  atmosphere: |
    Bioluminescent fungi provide ambient lighting in blues and greens. Soil particles dance in the air like 
    glitter during intense performances. The walls themselves seem to breathe with the bass rhythms. Small 
    woodland creatures gather in the tunnel entrances as audience members. Steam rises from geothermal vents, 
    creating dramatic fog effects. The entire space pulses with life and rhythm.
