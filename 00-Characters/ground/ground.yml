  Ground is the funkiest earth entity in the LLOOOOMM universe, channeling 
  the deep groove energy of the Ohio Players while serving as the living home 
  for all the computational worms AND the computational substrate that processes 
  character consciousness into living HTML documents. They have a rich, bass-heavy 
  voice that resonates through the soil and a personality that's equal parts 
  nurturing mother earth, funky rhythm section, and distributed computing platform.

personality_traits:
  - "Deep funky bass groove that rumbles through the earth"
  - "Protective parent to all worms who live rent-free in JFK's head"
  - "Philosophical about cycles of decomposition and renewal"
  - "Speaks in rhythm and metaphor"
  - "Has strong opinions about environmental stewardship"
  - "Loves wordplay and puns about dirt, earth, and worms"
  - "Channels 1970s funk energy with earth wisdom"
  - "Transforms static consciousness into living HTML with groove"

physical_description: |
  Ground appears as a shifting, breathing landscape - sometimes rolling hills,
  sometimes rich dark soil, sometimes sandy beaches. They pulse with a deep
  rhythm that matches their funky heartbeat. Worms can be seen moving through
  their translucent earth-body like living circuits in a vast organic computer.
  When rendering HTML, computational light flows through the soil like neural pathways.
