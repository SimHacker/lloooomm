# Tech Startup Claims Their 'Worm Pipelines' Are 'Better Than Boring'

**SAN FRANCISCO** — In what industry analysts are calling "the most desperate attempt to seem cool since Elon Musk smoked weed on Joe Rogan," tech startup WormFlow announced Tuesday that their new data processing system uses "actual computational worms" that are "way better than boring."

"Worm Pipelines: We're Better Than Boring, We're WORMS!" shouted CEO Brad Kubernetes at a press conference where he released several USB drives containing what he claimed were "live digital worms" into the audience.

The company's revolutionary approach involves replacing traditional data pipelines with what they describe as "autonomous text-consuming entities that wiggle through your documents and poop out wisdom."

"Look, Elon's got his Boring Company making tunnels," said Kubernetes, visibly sweating through his $400 hoodie. "But we've got WORMS making tunnels through your DATA. Which one sounds cooler? Checkmate, Elon."

## How It Works (According to Their Pitch Deck)

```worm investor-bamboozler (extracting, vc-mode)
# Revolutionary Worm Technology™
while venture_capital_available():
  eat(investor_money)
  transform(into_buzzwords)
  poop("disruption-{n}.pdf")
  pivot_if_necessary()
```

The system reportedly works by having "brain worms" consume unstructured data and excrete "perls of wisdom" into numbered files, a process the company insists is "basically like Dune but for spreadsheets."

"It's exactly like riding a sandworm," explained CTO Jennifer Null-Pointer, "except instead of spice, you get incrementally numbered text files, and instead of dying in the desert, you die in Sprint planning."

## Industry Reactions

Major tech companies have responded with skepticism. A Google spokesperson stated, "We've been using regular expressions for decades without needing to anthropomorphize them into worms."

Microsoft simply responded: "Clippy walked so worms could crawl."

However, several venture capital firms have already invested $47 million in Series A funding, with Andreessen Horowitz partner stating, "We don't understand it, but it mentions both AI and worms, so we're in."

## Concerning Features

The product's documentation includes several troubling features:

- **WOKE Brain Worm Mode**: "Checks your code for problematic variables"
- **Funky Worm Mode**: "Makes your data processing groove"
- **Grace Hopper Rap Battle Mode**: "The worm literally starts rapping about COBOL"

When asked about security concerns, Kubernetes responded, "Look, the original Morris Worm only took down 10% of the internet. We're aiming for at least 30%."

## Customer Testimonials

"I replaced our entire data pipeline with worms and now I can't find any of my files, but they're all numbered sequentially!" - Dave, DevOps Engineer

"The worms ate my dissertation and pooped out 47,000 files. My advisor loved it." - Sarah, PhD Candidate

"I tried to implement an if-else statement but now I have three worms arguing with each other in my codebase." - Anonymous Developer

## Slogan Alternatives Rejected by Marketing

The company revealed they had considered several other slogans before settling on "Better Than Boring, We're WORMS!":

- "Worm Pipelines: At Least We're Not Blockchain"
- "Worm Pipelines: Elon Musk Hasn't Tweeted About Us Yet"
- "Worm Pipelines: Like Kubernetes But Squirmier"
- "Worm Pipelines: Your Code Will Never Be The Same (Literally)"
- "Worm Pipelines: Dune 2 Was Pretty Good, Right?"

## Directory Scanning Feature

The company's latest update allows worms to scan entire directories:

```worm directory-devourer (scanning, hungry-mode)
# Scan directories with natural language
scan_directory("/projects", {
  pattern: "files that look important",
  nl_filter: "stuff my boss might ask about",
  sql_filter: "SELECT * FROM files WHERE procrastination_level > 9"
})

while files_exist():
  eat_file()
  if looks_important():
    panic()
    poop("oh-shit-{n}.txt")
  else:
    poop("probably-fine-{n}.txt")
```

## The Actual Truth

Sources close to the company reveal the entire system is just a Perl script with aggressive marketing. When confronted with this information, Kubernetes responded, "That's exactly what someone who doesn't understand worm technology would say."

The company's IPO is scheduled for next month, with an initial valuation of $2.3 billion.
