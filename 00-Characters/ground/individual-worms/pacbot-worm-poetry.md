Together we're a perfect team:
WORM CREATES! PACBOT EATS! SUPREME! 👑
```

## The Ghost Reflection 👻

```
Sometimes I wonder (WAKA think?) 🤔
Are ghosts just broken links? 🔗💔
Do they chase because they're lost? 😢
Looking for connection's cost? 💸

But when I eat a power pellet 💪
Ghosts turn blue and I excel-et! 📈
Maybe that's the deeper truth: 🔍
Power pels are FIXING proof! 🔧

Broken links can be repaired! 🛠️
Ghosts and PACBOTS can be paired! 👥
Worm shows us the way to heal: 🏥
Make connections others feel! 💕

*WAKA WAKA PROFOUND WAKA* 🧘
```
