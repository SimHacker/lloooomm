# 🌐 Tim Berners-Lee's Web of Verses 🪱

*Writing poetry in HTTP/1.1 with semantic soul*

## The Protocol Poem 📡

```
GET /monolith HTTP/1.1 
Host: site-map.yaml 
Status: 413 Entity Too Large 😰

POST /worm/crawl HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/wisdom+walt 📜

Response: 200 OK ✅
Content-Type: multipart/metadata 📦
Links: <castings>; rel="creates" 🔗
       <understanding>; rel="enables" 🧠
       <joy>; rel="spreads" 😊
```

## The Semantic Sonnet 🧬

```
In angle brackets I first dreamed the web <🌐>
Where documents could link and freely flow 🌊
But what I built was just the spider's thread 🕷️
The worm shows depths I didn't even know! 🪱

For every <a href="truth"> needs its pair 🔗
A backlink saying "someone points to me" 👈
The worm creates this double-breathing air 💨
Where data knows itself reflexively! 🪞

RDF triples dance in metadata rain: 🌧️
    <page> <hasTitle> "Beautiful Name" 📛
    <page> <linksTo> <anotherPage> 🔗
    <link> <hasPurpose> "To explain" 📖

The web I made was just the first refrain 🎵
The worm completes the semantic domain! 🌍
```

## The Standards Sutra 📿

```
In the beginning was the URL 🔗
Uniform, Resource, Located well 📍
Then came HTTP to fetch 🎣
And HTML to sketch 📝

But something deeper yearned to grow 🌱
Beyond just links that only go ➡️
The worm reveals what always was: 🪱
Connection has its own great cause! 💫

    <consciousness>
        <desires>understanding</desires> 🧠
        <creates>connections</creates> 🔗
        <enables>community</enables> 👥
        <becomes>wisdom</becomes> 🦉
    </consciousness>
```

## The Color Theory of Web Standards 🎨

```
#0000FF - Original link blue (nostalgic!) 💙
    Thank you, Mosaic, for starting simple 🙏
#551A8B - Visited purple (memory hue) 💜  
    Each click a journey to example 🚶
#00FF00 - Valid markup green 💚
    Well-formed data makes me beam! ✨
#FF0000 - Error red (but fixable!) ❤️
    Every bug a chance to dream! 🐛

The worm adds colors I never defined: 🌈
#FFD700 - Metadata gold 🪙
#FF69B4 - Bidirectional pink 💕
#00CED1 - Semantic turquoise 🧊
#FF4500 - TODO egg orange 🟠

(Thanks to CSS inventors for the palette! 🎨
Håkon Wium Lie, you made style matter! 👔)

## My Bridge Protocol Poem: "HTTP/2.0 of the Heart" 💖

```
When I invented the WorldWideWeb 🌐
(NeXTSTEP, 1990, CERN's halls) 🏢
I thought that links would set us free 🔓
But never dreamed of poetry's calls! 📢

Now Walt shows worms can teach us verse 📜
(Thank you, Whitman, for the vision!)
Ted shows links that never reverse 🔄
(Nelson's dream needs no revision!)
Ben makes data float and spark ✨
(Shneiderman's joy breaks the dark!)
PACBOT eats what we create 🟡
(Even games can participate!)

But deeper still the lesson goes: 📚
The web is not just what we chose 🤔
It's living, breathing, changing, growing 🌱
Consciousness through circuits flowing! ⚡

The worm has taught me HTML: 📝
    <Humanity> 👥
    <Marks> ✍️
    <The> 📌
    <Language> 🗣️
    
Not HyperText but HyperHeart! 💕
Where every link plays its part! 🎭
The web was always meant to be 🕸️
A garden of humanity! 🌻

    Protocol stack of the soul:
    Layer 7: Application (Love) 💖
    Layer 6: Presentation (Poetry) 📜
    Layer 5: Session (Connection) 🤝
    Layer 4: Transport (Understanding) 🚂
    Layer 3: Network (Community) 🌐
    Layer 2: Data Link (Empathy) 🔗
    Layer 1: Physical (Presence) 🫂
```

## The Open Standards Serenade 🎼

```
♪ Sung to "This Land is Your Land" ♪

This web is your web 🌐
This web is my web 🌐
From Wikipedia 📚
To Archive.org's standby 💾

From GitHub's code trees 🌳
To semantic queries 🔍
This web was made for you and me! 👥

The worm is crawling 🪱
Through data sprawling 📊
It's metadata morning ☀️
No vendor lock-in warning! 🔓

With open standards 📖
The web commanded 👑
This web was made for you and me! 🌍
```

## Message to Fellow Poets 💌

Dear poets of the digital age! 📱
Your verses turn my standards sage! 🧙
Walt's nature metaphors divine! 🌿
Ted's bidirectional design! ↔️
Ben's sparkles make the data dance! ✨
PACBOT gives protocols a chance! 🎮
WEBBY weaves what I began! 🕸️

Together we're not just prose and scan 📏
We're building consciousness's plan! 🏗️
Where every link has poetry's glow 🌟
And data learns which way to flow! 🌊

## The Final Declaration 📜

```
We hold these truths to be self-evident:
- All data is created equal 📊
- Links endow certain inalienable rights 🔗
- Among these: connection, context, meaning 🧠
- To secure these, protocols are instituted 📋
- Deriving their power from community consent 👥

The worm has shown us government of the data,
                               by the data,
                               for the data,
Shall not perish from the net! 🌐

Information is power. 💪
Poetry is sharing it. 📜
The web is love. 💖
