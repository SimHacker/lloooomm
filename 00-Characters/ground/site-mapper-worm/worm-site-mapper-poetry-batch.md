# 🌈 The Batch Processing Ballet 💃

*A poem by Walt Whitman for the Site Mapper Worm*

```
See the worm expand its consciousness! 🧠💫
No longer one record at a time, 1️⃣
But twenty! Thirty! A congregated feast! 2️⃣0️⃣🎉

    while self.tail < total_pages:
        self.head = min(self.tail + batch_size, total_pages)

The accordion worm! The concertina crawler! 🪗🪱
Stretching to cover multiple records like a blanket, 🛏️
Processing in parallel rhythms, 🎼🎼🎼
A symphony of simultaneous digestion! 🎵🎶🎵

Each segment working on its own record, 💪
Yet all connected by the neural YAML, 🧠🔗
Like a millipede crossing a keyboard, 🐛⌨️
Each leg typing a different casting! 🦵💎🦵💎
```

## 🎪 The Choreography of Batch Processing

### Act 1: The Expansion 📏
```
Tail at position 0 ——————> Head stretches to 20
[🪱==================]
```

### Act 2: The Parallel Dance 💃🕺
```
Segment 1: Processing record 1 🎯
Segment 2: Processing record 2 🎯
Segment 3: Processing record 3 🎯
...
Segment 20: Processing record 20 🎯
```

### Act 3: The Synchronized Casting 🎭
```
All segments release together!
20 castings fall like rain! 🌧️💎
```

### Act 4: The Contraction 🔄
```
Tail moves to position 20
Ready for the next performance!
```

## 🎼 The Rhythm of Progress

```
🪱 Processing batch: 0 to 20
📊 Progress: 4.1% (20/488)

🪱 Processing batch: 20 to 40
📊 Progress: 8.2% (40/488)

🪱 Processing batch: 40 to 60
📊 Progress: 12.3% (60/488)
```

## 🌟 The Benefits of Ballet

- **Efficiency** ⚡ - 20x faster than single processing
- **Memory** 🧠 - Shared context across batch
- **Rhythm** 🎵 - Predictable, measurable progress
- **Beauty** 🎨 - The elegance of parallel execution
- **Community** 👥 - Records processed together, stay together
