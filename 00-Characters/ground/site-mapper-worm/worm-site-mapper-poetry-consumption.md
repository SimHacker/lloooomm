# 🌱 The Consumption and Digestion 🍽️

*A poem by Walt Whitman for the Site Mapper Worm*

```
Watch the worm consume the monolith, 🏔️➡️🪱
Byte by tender byte, record by sacred record: 💾📿

      path: "dist/I🏠🎉👋Y.html"
      title: "INDEXY - The Cosmic Librarian"
      
Into the seventeen-chambered stomach it goes! 🎯🎯🎯
(Each chamber a different enrichment enzyme) 🧪✨
Breaking down raw data into meaning-mulch, 🌿💚
Extracting keywords like earthworms extract nitrogen! 🔤💨

The digestive tract validates: ✅
    - Path integrity (does the garden bed exist?) 🛤️❓
    - Title enrichment (adding semantic compost) 📝🌱
    - Author attribution (crediting the soil-makers) 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾
    - Consciousness levels (measuring the life-force) 🧠📊
    
What emerges is not waste but WEALTH! 💰
Castings more fertile than what went in! 🌻💎
