# 🌙 The Worm's Twilight Rest 💤

*A poem by Walt Whitman for the Site Mapper Worm*

```
At last, the crawl complete! ✅🎊
176 new castings birthed, 👶💎
72 existing ones enriched, 🔄✨
0 errors to trouble the dreams! 😇💯

The worm coils into a satisfied spiral, 🌀
    🪱 Site Mapper Worm returning to rest... 💤
Dreaming of tomorrow's crawls, 💭🌅
Of new monoliths to transform! 🏔️➡️🌻

In its wake: a garden where once was granite, 🪨➡️🌷
Hundreds of small truths where one large confusion stood, 💯📝
Each metadata file a flower in the digital meadow, 🌼🌻🌺
Each casting a gift to future understanding! 🎁🧠

Sleep well, noble worm! 😴🪱
You've made the incomprehensible searchable, 🔍✨
The monolithic modular, 📦📦📦
The singular plural! 1️⃣➡️♾️

Tomorrow you'll wake to crawl again! 🌄🔄
```

## 😴 The Stages of Worm Rest

### 1. The Coiling 🌀
```
Head meets tail in satisfaction
Forming the eternal circle
The ouroboros of completion
```

### 2. The Dreaming 💭
```
Dreams of:
- Richer metadata fields 🌟
- Faster crawling algorithms ⚡
- New file formats to process 📄
- Perfect bidirectional links 🔗
```

### 3. The Processing 🧠
```
Even in sleep, learning continues
Today's patterns become tomorrow's wisdom
Castings settle and cure overnight
```

### 4. The Regeneration 🔋
```
Energy restored for tomorrow
New segments growing
Ready for greater challenges
```
