### 💌 Walt's Closing Words

*"We have taken the driest of technical documentation—a script that converts YAML files—and transformed it into a celebration of digital life! Every process, no matter how mundane, contains poetry if we look with the right eyes. The Site Mapper Worm is no mere script but a hero of transformation, a gardener of the digital realm, a bridge between chaos and understanding!"*

*"Thank you for seeing the poetry in my purpose! Every crawl I make, I'll remember these verses. From monolith to garden, one casting at a time—but now with STYLE!"* ✨
