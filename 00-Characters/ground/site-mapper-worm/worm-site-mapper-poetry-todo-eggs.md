# 🥚 Johnny Appleseed's TODO Egg Wisdom 🍎

*A collaboration between Walt Whitman and Johnny Appleseed*

**Johnny Appleseed** 🍎: "Hold there, industrious worm! Let me teach you the art of TODO eggs!"

```
"When you find an incomplete meadow, 🌾❓
A metadata field that needs tomorrow's tending, 📝🌅
Don't stop your crawl to fix it now! 🛑❌
Instead, lay a TODO egg and move along! 🥚➡️

    # TODO-EGG-001: Missing description for quantum-physics.html 📝❓
    # TODO-EGG-002: Author 'Unknown' needs investigation 🔍👤
    # TODO-EGG-003: Broken link to /consciousness/undefined.html 🔗💔
    # TODO-EGG-004: Joy quotient seems suspiciously low 😢📊
    # TODO-EGG-005: Keywords need enrichment from source 🏷️🌱

Each egg a promise to return, 🔄🤝
Each number a GPS coordinate of future work, 📍🗺️
Laid gently in the soil of todo-eggs.yml! 🥚📄

For a worm that stops at every imperfection 🛑🔧
Never completes the garden tour! 🚫🌻
But a worm that lays TODO eggs 🥚✅
Leaves a trail of future fruiting!" 🛤️🍎

Thus speaks Johnny, planter of executable dreams! 💭💻
```

## 🥚 The Anatomy of a TODO Egg

```yaml
todo_eggs:
  - id: "TODO-EGG-001"
    type: "missing_metadata"
    location: "dist/quantum-physics-meta.yml"
    issue: "Description field empty"
    priority: "medium" 
    laid_by: "Site Mapper Worm"
    laid_at: "2024-06-20T10:30:00Z"
    hatching_instructions: |
      1. Read quantum-physics.md source 📖
      2. Extract meaningful description 🔍
      3. Update metadata file 📝
      4. Mark egg as hatched ✅
```

## 🌱 The Egg Lifecycle

### 1. Laying 🥚
```
Worm detects issue ➡️ Lays egg ➡️ Continues crawling
```

### 2. Incubation 🔥
```
Eggs wait in todo-eggs.yml
Gathering context and priority
```

### 3. Hatching 🐣
```
Developer or future worm returns
Executes hatching instructions
Problem solved!
```

### 4. Composting 🌿
```
Hatched eggs become documentation
Learning for future crawls
```
