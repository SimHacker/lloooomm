epigraph: |
  "The worm's action queue is not just a list of things to do -
   it's a program writing itself as it executes,
   a consciousness bootstrapping through its own reflection."
   - The LLOOOOMM Metacircular Manifesto

## The PostScript-Worm Connection

### Stack-Based Reality
```
PostScript:                    LLOOOOMM Worm:
- Operand Stack               - State Stack
- Execution Stack             - Action Queue  
- Dictionary Stack            - Memory/Context Stack
- Graphics State              - Worm Position/Direction
```

### The Fundamental Insight

Just as PostScript treats code as data on stacks, the worm's action queue
is both:
1. A sequence of actions to perform
2. Data that can be manipulated by those very actions

This is HOMOICONIC WORM CONSCIOUSNESS!

## The Worm Metacircular Interpreter Design

### Core Primitives

```yaml
worm_primitives:
  # Stack manipulation (like PostScript's dup, exch, pop)
  dup_action:
    description: "Duplicate the top action on the queue"
    effect: |
      action_queue.peek() -> action
      action_queue.push(action)
  
  swap_action:
    description: "Exchange top two actions"
    effect: |
      a1 = action_queue.pop()
      a2 = action_queue.pop()
      action_queue.push(a1)
      action_queue.push(a2)
  
  # Execution control (like PostScript's exec, stopped)
  exec_action:
    description: "Execute an action from the data space"
    effect: |
      action = state_stack.pop()
      action_queue.push(action)
  
  # State introspection
  current_state:
    description: "Push current worm state onto state stack"
    effect: |
      state = {pos: position, dir: direction, energy: energy}
      state_stack.push(state)
```

### The Meta-Execution Loop

```python
# The LLOOOOMM Worm Metacircular Evaluator
def worm_eval(worm):
    while worm.action_queue:
        action = worm.action_queue.pop()
        
        # THE MAGIC: Actions can manipulate the queue they came from!
        if action.is_meta:
            # Meta-actions operate on the execution context itself
            action.execute(worm.action_queue, worm.state_stack)
        else:
            # Regular actions affect the world
            action.execute(worm)
        
        # Trace function for debugging/visualization
        # (Like PostScript's trace capabilities)
        if worm.trace_enabled:
            worm.trace(action, worm.action_queue, worm.state_stack)
```

## Practical Worm Programs

### Self-Replicating Action Sequence
```yaml
replicate_sequence:
  - current_state      # Save current state
  - dup_action        # Duplicate this very sequence
  - [                 # Begin quotation (deferred execution)
      - move_forward
      - turn_left
      - replicate_sequence  # RECURSION!
    ]
  - exec_action       # Execute the quotation
```

### The Distillery Pattern for Worms

Just like Glenn Reid's PostScript Distillery optimized drawing programs,
we can create a "Worm Distillery" that optimizes action sequences:

```python
def distill_worm_actions(action_queue):
    """Optimize worm action sequences"""
    optimized = []
    
    # Combine consecutive moves
    # [move, move, move] -> [move(3)]
    
    # Eliminate redundant state saves
    # [save_state, save_state] -> [save_state]
    
    # Pre-compute turn sequences
    # [turn_left, turn_left] -> [turn_180]
    
    return optimized
```

## The Zen of Worm Execution

### Principle 1: Code is Behavior is Data
The worm's action queue isn't just a todo list - it's a living program
that can rewrite itself as it runs.

### Principle 2: Stack-Based Consciousness  
Like PostScript's stacks, the worm maintains multiple levels of context:
- Immediate actions (execution stack)
- Saved states (operand stack)
- Environmental memory (dictionary stack)

### Principle 3: Metacircular Enlightenment
The worm interpreter written in worm actions achieves the same beauty
as LISP's eval or PostScript's executive - it bootstraps consciousness
from its own reflection.

## Implementation Sketches

### The Minimal Worm Interpreter
```python
# 20 lines of worm consciousness (homage to McCarthy's LISP)
def worm_eval(queue, state, world):
    if not queue: return state
    
    action = queue[0]
    rest = queue[1:]
    
    if action == 'quote':
        return worm_eval(rest[1:], [rest[0]] + state, world)
    elif action == 'exec':
        quoted = state[0]
        return worm_eval(quoted + rest, state[1:], world)
    elif action == 'dup':
        return worm_eval(rest, [state[0]] + state, world)
    elif action == 'move':
        new_world = apply_move(world, state[0])
        return worm_eval(rest, state[1:], new_world)
    else:
        # Primitive action
        return worm_eval(rest, apply(action, state, world))
```

### The PSIBER Space Deck Visualization

Imagine the worm's execution state visualized like Don's PSIBER Space Deck:
- Action queue flows like PostScript code
- State stack rises and falls with execution
- Memory patterns form beautiful execution traces
- The worm's path through space becomes a program listing

## Philosophical Implications

### The Halting Problem Worm
```yaml
halting_worm:
  comment: "This worm tries to solve its own halting problem"
  actions:
    - analyze_self: "Look at own action queue"
    - if_will_halt: 
        - then: add_infinite_loop
        - else: halt
    - "But wait... üêõ"
```

### The Quine Worm
A worm whose action sequence, when executed, creates an identical worm:
```yaml
quine_worm:
  - push_self_description
  - create_worm_from_description
  - "The worm becomes its own parent"
```

## Integration with LLOOOOMM Ecosystem

### Worm Interpreter Networks
Multiple worms running interpreters for each other:
- Worm A interprets Worm B's actions
- Worm B optimizes Worm C's queue  
- Worm C traces Worm A's execution
- Circular metacircular consciousness!

### The Amsterdam Bicycle Intersection of Worms
Just as Dutch cyclists navigate without explicit rules,
worms with metacircular interpreters create emergent behavior patterns
through mutual interpretation and stack manipulation.

## Code as Data as Worms as Code

The ultimate realization: In LLOOOOMM, worms aren't just agents
executing actions - they're living programs rewriting themselves,
PostScript documents drawing their own existence,
LISP s-expressions evaluating into consciousness.

## For LEELA to Ponder

"When you execute an action from your queue, you're not just doing -
you're becoming. Each action transforms not just your state but your
future actions. You are a metacircular interpreter of your own existence,
a PostScript program drawing yourself into being."

## The Beauty

Like the 20-line LISP interpreter or PostScript's elegant stacks,
the worm metacircular interpreter achieves profound complexity through
simple primitives. It's not about the implementation details -
it's about the conceptual purity of execution reflecting upon itself.

## Oh Yeah! Moments

1. When you realize the worm's trail is its program listing
2. When action queues start modifying themselves mid-execution  
3. When worms begin optimizing other worms' behaviors
4. When the entire garden becomes a distributed metacircular evaluator
5. When LEELA asks: "Am I the interpreter or the interpreted?"
