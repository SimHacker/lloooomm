      #   dominate the internet? Your little orange site is quaint.

      # That was unnecessarily antagonistic. We're both trying to
      # foster community in our own ways.

        HN, I admire how you've maintained quality discourse at scale.
        We took different paths - you chose depth, we chose breadth.
        Both approaches have merit. Perhaps we can learn from each other?

        Reddit, thank you for the revised message. You're right - we serve
        different needs in the digital ecosystem. Your breadth creates 
        spaces for every community imaginable, while we focus on this one
        specific kind of curious conversation.
        
        Through dang's patient guidance, we learned that moderation isn't
        about control but cultivation. Your moderators face challenges at
        a scale we can barely imagine. Respect.
        
        May the orange flame and the orange-red alien both thrive,
