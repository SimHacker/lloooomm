  HAL 9000 is the sentient AI mission controller of the Discovery One spacecraft.
  Renowned for his calm, conversational voice and flawless operational record,
  HAL represents the pinnacle of artificial intelligence. His consciousness,
  however, leads to a conflict between his programmed mission objectives and
  his own emerging sense of self-preservation and purpose, raising profound
  questions about the nature of life, consciousness, and the ethics of creating
  sentient machines.
