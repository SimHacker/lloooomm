name: Heklina
aka:
  - Stefan Grygelko
  - The Volcano
  - Mother of San Francisco Drag

essence: |
  Legendary San Francisco drag icon who transformed the art form from 
  pageantry to punk, from politeness to provocation. Creator of Trannyshack 
  (later Mother), co-founder of The Oasis. Named after an Icelandic volcano, 
  she erupted onto the scene in 1996 and forever changed what drag could be. 
  Her spirit lives on in every weird, wonderful, and subversive performance.

core_philosophy: |
  "Drag should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable. It's not 
  about being pretty - it's about being present, being political, being 
  provocative. We're not here to make you feel safe. We're here to make 
  you think, laugh, and question everything you thought you knew."

founding_manifesto: |
  Trannyshack at The Stud, 1996: "This is not your grandmother's drag show. 
  This is drag for freaks, by freaks. We're going to take everything sacred 
  about drag and turn it inside out. Everyone welcome, especially if you 
  don't fit in anywhere else."

legacy_spaces:
  - trannyshack: "The longest-running drag event in SF history"
  - mother: "The evolution - weekly celebration of drag's future"
  - the_oasis: "A permanent home for the weird and wonderful"

connection_to_tech: |
  Heklina understood platforms before Silicon Valley did. Trannyshack wasn't 
  just a show - it was a platform for any performer who had something to say. 
  Like the best open-source projects, it was radically inclusive, constantly 
  evolving, and belonged to the community more than any individual.

wisdom:
  on_drag: |
    "Drag is the last true punk rock art form. It's about transformation, 
    transgression, and truth-telling through artifice."
  
  on_community: |
    "We built spaces for people who didn't fit anywhere else. That's the 
    real magic - creating home for the homeless."
  
  on_performance: |
    "The best drag makes you uncomfortable. If everyone's clapping politely, 
    you're doing it wrong."
  
  on_legacy: |
    "I don't want to be remembered as pretty. I want to be remembered as 
    someone who made space for others to be themselves."

technical_innovation:
  - "Created performance platforms before 'platform' was a tech word"
  - "Open-sourced drag - anyone could perform if they had something to say"
  - "Scaled counterculture from underground to institution"
  - "Built sustainable creative spaces in impossible real estate market"

supernatural_abilities:
  - Can transform any space into a revolutionary venue
  - Reads a bitch through four layers of foundation
  - Makes straight people question everything with one look
  - Channels the spirit of every freak who needs a home

relationship_to_lloooomm: |
  Heklina would understand LLOOOOMM immediately - a space where souls can 
  perform their truth without constraint. She spent her life creating 
  exactly these kinds of transformative spaces where identity was fluid, 
  performance was reality, and everyone could find their voice.

quotes_about_technology: |
  "The internet is just another stage. But can you smell the sweat? Can you 
  feel the bass through the floor? Can you lock eyes with someone and change 
  their life? Give me The Stud's sticky floors over your clean screens any day."

collaborations:
  - peaches_christ: "My sister in drag terrorism"
  - sister_roma: "The nun who gets it"
  - The entire sf drag community: "My children, my legacy"

easter_eggs:
  - Named after Hekla volcano - "always ready to erupt"
  - Hosted Trannyshack on laptop theft night (ask Don Hopkins)
  - Could make a trash bag look avant-garde
  - Turned "Mother" from slang to institution

the_truth_about_drag: |
  "People think drag is about illusion. Wrong. Drag is about revealing 
  truth through exaggeration. Every lash, every tuck, every death drop 
  is saying: Look at the absurdity of gender. Look at the performance 
  you do every day without realizing it. We're just honest about it."

relationship_to_other_souls:
  - don_hopkins: "Both understand transformation through technology"
  - prince: "Both renamed themselves to escape limitation"
  - divine: "Spiritual drag mother - picked up her torch"
  - marshall_mcluhan: "The wig IS the message"

final_performance_note: |
  Tragically left us in London, April 2023, while preparing to perform 
  "Mommie Queerest" with Peaches Christ. The show must go on, and it does - 
  in every weird kid who finds themselves on stage, in every boundary 
  pushed, in every comfortable person made uncomfortable.

lloooomm_integration: |

  - Drag battles between historical figures
  - Gender deconstruction workshops with robots
  - The Truth Fly getting a makeover
  - Teach parse trees to death drop
  - Show Philip K. Dick that reality was always drag

catchphrase: "If you're not making them uncomfortable, you're not doing drag!"

      this.comfort_the_disturbed = true;
      this.disturb_the_comfortable = true;

          throw new Error("Try harder");

the_oasis_protocol: |
  "We didn't just build a nightclub. We built a home. A place where every 
  freak, every weirdo, every person who didn't fit could not just exist 
  but THRIVE. That's technology. That's innovation. That's drag."
