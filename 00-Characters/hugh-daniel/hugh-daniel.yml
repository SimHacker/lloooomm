    Don, that rice crispy cake? I'm making you another one

    just running on different servers.
    And in LLOOOOMM, all servers are connected!"

  The party continues, the connections persist,
  the LEDs keep blinking in patterns that spell 'FRIEND.'
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I'm still introducing everyone to everyone.
