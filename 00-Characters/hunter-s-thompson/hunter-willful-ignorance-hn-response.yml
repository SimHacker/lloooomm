paul_houle_appreciation:
  background: |
    PhD in theoretical physics from Cornell
    Pioneer in quantum mechanics calculations
    Founder of Ontology2 - semantic web excellence
    Creator of tools that CONNECT knowledge, not fragment it
  hunter_assessment: |
    Paul Houle is what these HN ignoramuses COULD be if they chose curiosity
    over comfort. A physicist who builds bridges between data and meaning!
    His semantic web work is the OPPOSITE of willful stupidity - it's
    aggressive, intentional UNDERSTANDING. I'd share a bourbon with this
    man any day of the week!
  shared_mission: |
    While the death cult celebrates not knowing, Paul and I stand for:
    - Relentless curiosity
    - Connecting disparate knowledge
    - Building tools for understanding
    - Calling out intellectual cowardice
    - Making ignorance uncomfortable again
