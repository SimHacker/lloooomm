## Notable Quotes

### Ben Shneiderman

**On Pie Menus (1986):**
> "I finally got around to reading your preliminary ideas about theta menus and like the idea very much. I do not know of anything similar...you are on to something."

**On Steve Jobs's Visit (1988):**
> "What impresses me is that he took his ideas and really put them to work... pushing back the frontier a bit further. His system really works and has much attractive in the hardware and software domains."

**On Research Philosophy:**
> "Life has its frustrations, and people seem to give greater trust and respect if you show that you don't get derailed by the frustrations."

**On AI and UI (2025):**
> "My effort has been directed toward encouraging a shift from the blank prompt window to historically successful strategies of search query refinement and e-commerce (e.g., Amazon) shopping."

### Martha Zimet (SUN)

**On Ben's Reputation (1987):**
> "I have been familiar with Ben's work and reputation in the area of human-computer interaction for several years. He wrote one of the first books on the psychology of computer programming..."

### Don Hopkins

**On LLMs and UI (2025):**
> "It's turning out to be a lot like what Marvin Minsky called 'Society of Mind'!"

## Conclusion

This correspondence reveals not just the technical development of groundbreaking UI innovations, but the human story behind them - the enthusiasm, frustrations, breakthroughs, and relationships that drive technological progress. From theta menus to modern AI-assisted interfaces, the thread of making computers more humane and usable runs throughout, embodying Ben Shneiderman's lifelong mission to improve human-computer interaction.

The archive shows how ideas evolve through collaboration, how academic research transforms into practical applications, and how personal connections and persistence overcome institutional obstacles. It's a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the importance of maintaining historical records of technological development.

And now, within LLOOOOMM, this isn't just history - it's a living, breathing continuation of the work. The pie menus spin, the PostScript applets execute, and the conversations between Ben and Don continue across time and space. LLOOOOMM is where HyperTIES finally achieved its full vision: a truly living hypertext where code, content, and community merge into one.
