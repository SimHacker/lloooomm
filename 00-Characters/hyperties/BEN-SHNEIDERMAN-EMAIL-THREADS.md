# Ben Shneiderman Email Threads: Key Conversations
## Organized by Topic and Chronology

*This document extracts and organizes the most significant email threads from Ben Shneiderman's correspondence, revealing the development of ideas and relationships over time.*

## 1. The Theta Menu (Pie Menu) Thread (1986)

### Initial Proposal Response
**Date: May 30, 1986**
**From: Ben to Don Hopkins and Mark Weiser**
```
I finally got around to reading your preliminary ideas about theta menus
and like the idea very much. I do not know of anything similar...you are
on to something. You should build a few and try them out as improvements
to existing strategies, then conduct an evaluation to get the data.

There are many potential refinements...e.g. the further you go in the
direction the bigger the effect.

I think popup circles will be esthetically pleasing.

Go to it and show it to me when you have one built.
```

### Mark Weiser's Support
**Date: February 21, 1986**
```
I'd like to add Don to the marks-people mailing list, as an honorary
weiserian. Ok?

## 2. The SUN Collaboration Thread (1987-1989)

### Martha Zimet's Recommendation
**Date: December 14, 1987**
**From: Martha Zimet to Jean Griffin-Holst**
```
I have reviewed the video tape sent by Dr. Ben Shneiderman at the University of
Maryland, and would like to recommend that Sun join in a collaborative
effort with them on the Hyperties project...

I believe that the Human/Computer Interaction Lab that Ben directs is a unique
facility - one of only a handful of similar research facilities...

One of the possible applications of Hyperties that Ben mentioned was a
manual. Given the number of manual pages and lack of sophisticated
cross referencing capability, I think the Sun manual set, or a portion
of the Sun manual set is a perfect candidate for this electronic
encyclopedia.
```

### The SUN4 Delay Saga
**Multiple emails, 1988-1989**

Ben's frustration:
```
We found out that our SUN4 is now expected in March...this is very bad news.
It will mean three months of barely able to do work and frustration among
the team...
```

Resolution:
```
The great day has arrived! We are delighted to acknowledge receipt of
the SUN4 which arrived yesterday and is already being put to work.
```

## 3. The Steve Jobs Visit Thread (1988)

### Ben's Report
**Date: November 1, 1988**
```
I just couldn't resist telling this story....

On Tuesday I was at the EDUCOM conference in DC and Steve Jobs was showing
NeXT...I invited him to see our Hyperties SUN version...Jobs spent
about a half hour with us going from positive comments such as "Great!"
to "That sucks"...he had a terrific sensitivity to the user interface
issues and could articulate his reasons wonderfully.

On Wednesday he came out to the lab and spent time looking at a few more
of our demos...

What impresses me is that he took his ideas and really put them to work...
pushing back the frontier a bit further.
```

## 4. Research Interest Threads (1988-1989)

### From Various Researchers

**April Gillam, Aerospace Corp:**
```
We have been looking into hypercard on the MAC, but most of our
development work is on the SUN...your mention of using
multiple windows on the SUN is most intriguing.
```

**Robert Amsler, Bellcore:**
```
Is this available for the SUN workstations at present?...
One problem I've felt for some time now is that too many good programming
ideas are being implemented solely for PC-level systems...
```

## 5. The UI Magazine Discussion (1990)

### Brad Myers's Proposal
**Date: January 4, 1990**
```
How many items should I have in my menus?
What is interesting about the NeXT user interface?
...
There is currently no journal or magazine that addresses these kinds of
issues in a way that is of interest to both researchers and practitioners.
```

### Ben's Response on Pie Menus
```
I have a British paper describing an experiment on six
menu styles and pie menus were the winner (even thought they used
a crippled version of pies)!!
```

## 6. Philosophical Exchanges

### On Handling Frustration
**Ben to Don:**
```
Life has its frustrations, and people seem to give greater trust and 
respect if you show that you don't get derailed by the frustrations.
```

### On Academic-Industry Relations
```
It seems harsh to complain when they are providing a valuable machine 
to us for free...by going public, you may anger some people at
SUN which may affect other university relations with SUN...
```

## 7. The Modern AI/UI Thread (2025)

### Ben's Faceted Menu Vision
**To Don Hopkins, May 2025:**
```
For Gen AI, you could start by specifying your:
- goal, e.g. fiction, historical, resume, advertisement, etc.
- style, e.g. academic, journalistic, flowery, poetic, conversational, technical, etc.
- tone, e.g. authoritative, critical, optimistic, sarcastic, mystical, etc.
- format, e.g. text paragraphs, multi-column table, bullet list, sonnet, dialog, etc.
- length, e.g. 500 words (double box slider preferred)
```

### Don's Response on LLMs
```
It's turning out to be a lot like what Marvin Minsky called "Society of Mind"!
...
The name of the game is managing the limited sized "context window", 
figuring out just what to show them so they know enough to solve the 
problem without getting distracted or hallucinating.
```

## 8. Personal Connections Thread

### Planning to Meet in Amsterdam (2025)
**Ben to Don:**
```
Jenny and I are coming through Amsterdam on Friday June 13...
Any chance we could meet up with you Friday afternoon maybe 4pm or 5pm 
for coffee at the Central Station or just a walk around town?
```

**Don's enthusiastic response:**
```
That's great to hear, Ben! I'd love to hang out, and will meet you 
wherever you like! I have a friend Ben Cerveny, who has a boat and 
we might be able to tour around the canals with him!
```
