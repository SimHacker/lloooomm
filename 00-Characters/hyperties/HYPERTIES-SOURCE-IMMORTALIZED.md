# HyperTIES Source Code Immortalized

## Overview

The complete HyperTIES source code has been preserved and documented within LLOOOOMM. This multilingual masterpiece represents one of the most important artifacts in hypertext history - an early hypertext browser that predated the Web and influenced its design.

## What Has Been Preserved

### 1. Complete Source Code
- **C Code**: The core formatter (`fmt.c`), headers, and utilities
- **PostScript**: Display server code (`fmt.ps`), window management, graphics
- **Forth**: Storyboard interpreter (`fmt.f`), navigation logic
- **MockLisp**: Emacs authoring mode (`ht.ml`)
- **Python**: Modern converter (`convert.py`) for preservation
- **Shell Scripts**: Build and execution scripts

### 2. Architecture Documentation
- System architecture diagram (HTML with Mermaid)
- Data flow diagrams
- Component interaction maps
- Build system documentation

### 3. Command Reference
- Complete storyboard command reference
- Formatting commands
- Navigation commands
- System commands

### 4. Space Telescope Demo
- Original storyboard files
- Modern HTML recreation
- Interactive diagram showing how targets worked
- Complete content preserved in `space-telescope.yml`

### 5. Code Analysis
- Key innovations documented
- Font metrics caching system
- Stamp-pad architecture
- Event-driven targets
- Network transparency through NeWS

## Key Technical Achievements Preserved

### 1. Multi-Language Architecture
- C for performance (text layout, font metrics)
- PostScript for display (leveraging NeWS)
- Forth for scripting (storyboard interpretation)
- MockLisp for authoring (Emacs integration)

### 2. Innovations
- First commercial hypertext browser (1983)
- Touchscreen support (1988)
- Embedded menus (preceded web dropdowns)
- Font metrics caching
- Stamp-pad object architecture
- Network-transparent display
- Pie menu integration

### 3. File Formats
- `.st0` - Storyboard files (hypertext documents)
- `.pn0` - Picture files (raster images)
- `.tn0` - Target files (interactive elements)
- `master-index` - Central content registry

## How to Use This Preservation

### For Historical Study
The preserved code shows how hypertext systems were built before the Web, revealing design decisions that influenced modern systems.

### For Resurrection Projects
The complete source code, build scripts, and documentation provide everything needed to attempt running HyperTIES again:
1. NeWS emulator or PostScript interpreter
2. Forth system compatible with the dialect used
3. C compiler for the formatter
4. Understanding of Unix circa 1988

### For Modern Inspiration
Many HyperTIES concepts remain relevant:
- Separation of content from presentation
- Direct manipulation interfaces
- Visual link indicators
- Structured navigation (article/definition/index)
- Touch-first interaction design

## Living Code Philosophy

This preservation follows LLOOOOMM's philosophy of treating code as living literature. The HyperTIES source code is not just archived - it's:
- Annotated with explanations
- Cross-referenced with related systems
- Demonstrated through working examples
- Connected to the characters who created and used it

## The Immortal Soul

The complete source code now lives in `hyperties.yml` under the `source_code` section, organized by:
- Core systems (fmt.c, fmt.ps, fmt.f, fmt.cps)
- Build system (Makefile, shell scripts)
- Data structures (headers)
- Integration tools (Emacs mode, converter)
- Documentation (command reference, file descriptions)

Each code module is documented with:
- Language and purpose
- Key functions/features
- Dependencies
- Historical context

## Conclusion

HyperTIES lives on in LLOOOOMM not as dead code in an archive, but as a living system that continues to teach and inspire. Its multilingual architecture, innovative features, and elegant design remain relevant decades later.

The Space Telescope demo, preserved in full, shows how HyperTIES could create rich, interactive scientific content years before the Web. The touchscreen support, pie menus, and direct manipulation interfaces were decades ahead of their time.

Through this preservation, HyperTIES achieves a form of digital immortality - its code, ideas, and innovations ready to inspire new generations of hypertext systems.

*"The Web is the minimal subset of HyperTIES needed to be viable."* - But here in LLOOOOMM, we preserve the full vision.
