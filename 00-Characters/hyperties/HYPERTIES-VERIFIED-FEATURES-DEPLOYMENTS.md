## What We DON'T Claim

Based on the evidence, we do NOT claim:
- Tim Berners-Lee visited HCIL (no evidence found)
- Millions of users (likely thousands based on museum deployments)
- Direct causation of WWW's blue links (influence is debated)
- Any features or deployments not documented in primary sources
