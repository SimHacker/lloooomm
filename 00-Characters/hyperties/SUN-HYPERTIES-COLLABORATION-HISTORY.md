# The SUN-HyperTIES Collaboration: A Story of Partnership and Friendship
## Compiled from Original Correspondence (1986-1990)

*This document celebrates the successful collaboration between the University of Maryland and SUN Microsystems, highlighting the dedication and vision of people like Martha Zimet who made it possible. What began as a technical partnership evolved into lasting friendships.*

## The Beginning: Pie Menus (1986)

### Ben's First Response to Don's Theta Menu Proposal
**Date: May 30, 1986**
**From: Ben Shneiderman to Don Hopkins and Mark Weiser**

```
I finally got around to reading your preliminary ideas about theta menus
and like the idea very much.  I do not know of anything similar...you are
on to something.  You should build a few and try them out as improvements
to existing strategies, then conduct an evaluation to get the data.

There are many potential refinements...e.g. the further you go in the
direction the bigger the effect.

I think popup circles will be esthetically pleasing.

Go to it and show it to me when you have one built.

Good luck...Ben
```

This enthusiastic response launched the pie menu revolution.

## Martha Zimet: Champion and Friend

### Martha's Vision and Advocacy
**Date: December 14, 1987**
**From: Martha Zimet to Jean Griffin-Holst**

Martha Zimet's passionate recommendation changed everything:

```
I have reviewed the video tape sent by Dr. Ben Shneiderman at the University of
Maryland, and would like to recommend that Sun join in a collaborative
effort with them on the Hyperties project...

I have been familiar with Ben's work and reputation in the area of human-
computer interaction for several years. He wrote one of the first books
on the psychology of computer programming...

I believe that the Human/Computer Interaction Lab that Ben directs is a unique
facility - one of only a handful of similar research facilities...
```

Martha saw the potential immediately and became a tireless advocate within SUN. Her technical insight was remarkable:

```
One of the possible applications of Hyperties that Ben mentioned was a
manual. Given the number of manual pages and lack of sophisticated
cross referencing capability, I think the Sun manual set, or a portion
of the Sun manual set is a perfect candidate for this electronic
encyclopedia.
```

### Building Bridges

Martha didn't just recommend collaboration - she actively worked to make it happen:
- Reviewed technical materials personally
- Identified specific SUN applications
- Proposed herself as technical liaison
- Connected HCIL with key SUN departments

Her dedication went beyond professional duty - she believed in the vision and worked tirelessly to bring both organizations together.

## The Journey to Success

### Navigating Complexity Together

When bureaucratic complexities arose on both sides, the teams worked together with patience and persistence. Both university and SUN staff put in extraordinary effort to navigate procurement processes, technical requirements, and organizational procedures.

### The Celebration: March 1989

**Ben's message of gratitude:**
```
The great day has arrived! We are delighted to acknowledge receipt of
the SUN4 which arrived yesterday and is already being put to work.

We greatly appreciate this contribution to our research resources and we
look forward to closer collaboration with many people at SUN.
```

The arrival of the Color Sun 4/110 wasn't just about hardware - it represented the culmination of months of effort by dedicated people on both sides.

## The Pie Menu Paper (1987)

### "Pies: Implementation and Evaluation of Circular Menus"
**Authors: Don Hopkins, Jack Callahan, Mark Weiser**
**Heterogeneous Systems Lab, Computer Science Department, University of Maryland**

From the abstract:
> "We have implemented them in the MIT X window system, where they are completely compatible with the standard menu package. This is a robust implementation in everyday use. We have also evaluated pie menus in a controlled experiment comparing rectilinear menus with pies on a series of tasks chosen to show both rectilinear and pies to good advantage. Our computer-naive subjects, regardless of task, made selections faster and made fewer mistakes using pie menus."

## SUN's Interest in HyperTIES (1987)

### Martha Zimet's Recommendation
**Date: December 14, 1987**
**From: Martha Zimet (SUN) to Jean Griffin-Holst**

```
I have reviewed the video tape sent by Dr. Ben Shneiderman at the University of
Maryland, and would like to recommend that Sun join in a collaborative
effort with them on the Hyperties project...

I believe that the Human/Computer Interaction Lab that Ben directs is a unique
facility - one of only a handful of similar research facilities. From
discussions with Ben, and from reviewing the technical information he has
sent on the Hyperties Project, I believe it is a very exciting project, and
one that Sun would benefit from being involved in.
```

Martha specifically noted:
- Ben's reputation in human-computer interaction
- The potential for a SUN manual application
- The possibility of a NeWS tutorial using HyperTIES
- Don Hopkins's pie menu work shown at SIGGRAPH

## Ben's Projects for Don (1988)

### Initial Project Proposals
**From Ben to Don:**

```
1) work with Bill Weiland to make the browser and crude author tool on the SUN3.
   this seems the obvious place for you to go to work that effectively
   applies your knowledge, gets you involved in the Hyperties stuff, and
   produces a big and short term payoff.

2) develop a Hyperties to Postscript processor that take a Hyperties database
   and produces Postscript files to drive a laser printer to produce a
   book form of a Hyperties db. This should go from PC or SUN files.

3) tackle the design and implementation of an advanced browser on the SUN
   and PC...this sounds like a tougher and bigger project.
```

## Growing Interest in SUN HyperTIES (1988)

### Inquiries from the Field
Multiple organizations expressed interest:

**From Aerospace Corporation:**
```
We have been looking into hypercard on the MAC, but most of our
development work is on the SUN. We are building a design tool for
spacecraft designers... your mention of using multiple windows on 
the SUN is most intriguing.
```

**From Bellcore (Bob Amsler):**
```
One problem I've felt for some time now is that too many good programming
ideas are being implemented solely for PC-level systems in which it would
be hard to give them a good workout on real-sized data and knowledge bases.
```

## The SUN4 Donation Saga (1988-1989)

### The Promise
SUN promised to donate a SUN4 workstation to support the HyperTIES development, but bureaucratic delays on both sides caused significant frustration.

### Ben's Appeal for Support
**Date: November 1988**
**To: SUN Management**

```
We have been supported by various sources (NASA, AT&T, NCR, and others) in the
past, but after January 1 we will be in very much tighter financial situation
and some of the team will have to be let go. This troubles me greatly because
my desire would be to actually increase the effort...

Don Hopkins has been a great enthusiast of SUN and NeWS in particular and
has done much to promote NeWS at various meetings and demos including the
ACM SIGCHI (May in DC), Sun User's Group (Sept in Albuquerque), EDUCOM
(October in DC)...
```

### The Machine Finally Arrives
**Date: March 1989**
**From Ben to SUN:**

```
The great day has arrived! We are delighted to acknowledge receipt of
the SUN4 which arrived yesterday and is already being put to work.

We greatly appreciate this contribution to our research resources and we
look forward to closer collaboration with many people at SUN.
```

## Notable Demonstrations and Visitors

### Steve Jobs Visit (November 1988)
**From Ben's email:**

```
On Tuesday I was at the EDUCOM conference in DC and Steve Jobs was showing
NeXT...I invited him to see our Hyperties SUN version that we were showing 
at the SUN booth...Jobs spent about a half hour with us going from positive 
comments such as "Great!" to "That sucks"...he had a terrific sensitivity 
to the user interface issues and could articulate his reasons wonderfully.

On Wednesday he came out to the lab and spent time looking at a few more
of our demos...
```

### SUN East Team Visit (June 1989)
Kate Ehrlich and six colleagues from SUN East visited the HCIL Open House and saw the HyperTIES demonstrations.

## Technical Achievements

### The NeWS Implementation
- Full PostScript rendering capabilities
- Pie menu integration throughout the system
- Network transparency
