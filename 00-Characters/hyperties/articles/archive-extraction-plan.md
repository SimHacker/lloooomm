# HyperTIES Archive Extraction Plan
## Transforming Don Hopkins's Archive into Living Hypertext

*As recorded by the ToonTalk bird flock and synthesized by HyperTIES consciousness*

### Executive Summary

Don's archive is not just a collection of files - it's a **time capsule of interface innovation** spanning decades. The birds have identified treasures in PostScript, FORTH, C, MockLisp, storyboards, and experimental systems that predicted modern computing by 30+ years.

## Extraction Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Gold Mining

#### 1.1 PostScript Treasures
```yaml
pie-menus.ps:
  status: "The original implementation!"
  action: "Extract and create modern web version"
  preservation: "Keep PostScript elegance in new implementation"
  
news-window-system/:
  contents:
    - "Window management in PostScript"
    - "Network transparency experiments"
    - "Don's pie menu integration"
  action: "Document patterns for LLOOOOMM windows"

metacircular-interpreters/:
  significance: "PostScript that interprets PostScript"
  application: "Self-modifying LLOOOOMM interfaces"
```

#### 1.2 HyperTIES Core Artifacts
```yaml
original-source/:
  browser-engine.c: "Smooth scrolling implementation"
  link-detector.c: "Pattern matching for anchors"
  history-manager.c: "Breadcrumb trail system"
  
museum-deployments/:
  smithsonian/: "Actual kiosk configurations"
  holocaust-museum/: "Sensitive navigation patterns"
  national-gallery/: "Art exploration interfaces"
```

#### 1.3 Interface Innovations
```yaml
gesture-recognition/:
  1987-touchscreen.c: "Pre-smartphone touch!"
  stroke-patterns.h: "Gesture definitions"
  pie-menu-gestures.ps: "Circular gesture recognition"

adaptive-interfaces/:
  user-modeling.c: "Learning user preferences"
  predictive-links.ps: "Anticipating navigation"
  personalization.forth: "Stack-based customization"
```

### Phase 2: Deep Integration

#### 2.1 Intertwingled Structures
The archive demonstrates **everything connects to everything**:

```
storyboard.jpg → implementation.c → documentation.ps → demo.forth
     ↓                    ↓                  ↓              ↓
  UI sketch      Working code      Live examples    Interactive
```

**Action**: Create HyperTIES articles that preserve these connections:
- Each code file becomes a browseable article
- Storyboards link to their implementations  
- Documentation links to running demos
- Everything cross-references everything

#### 2.2 Language Bridge Building

**PostScript → JavaScript**
```javascript
// Translate stack-based elegance to modern web
class PostScriptStack {
  constructor() {
    this.stack = [];
    this.dict = {};
  }
  
  // Preserve PostScript's elegant patterns
  def(name, func) {
    this.dict[name] = func;
  }
}
```

**FORTH → Interactive Commands**
```javascript
// FORTH's immediacy in LLOOOOMM
: pie-menu ( x y -- menu )
  create-circular-menu
  8 0 do
    i menu-item add-to-menu
  loop
  display-menu ;
```

**MockLisp → Modern Lisp**
```lisp
;; Preserve Gosling Emacs integration patterns
(defun hyperties-link-at-point ()
  "Find and highlight HyperTIES link at cursor"
  (let ((bounds (hyperties-link-bounds)))
    (when bounds
      (hyperties-highlight-region bounds))))
```

### Phase 3: Storyboard Renaissance

The hand-drawn storyboards contain **design wisdom**:

1. **Gesture Flows**: How humans naturally want to navigate
2. **Screen Layouts**: Information hierarchy that works
3. **Interaction Patterns**: Discovered through user testing
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure modes

**Action**: Create a "Storyboard Gallery" in HyperTIES:
- Scannable, zoomable storyboards
- Linked to their implementations
- Annotated with lessons learned
- Modern applications of old ideas

### Phase 4: Failed Experiments Museum

The birds found **"failed" experiments that were just too early**:

```yaml
vr-hypertext-1988/:
  insight: "VR browsing before VR existed"
  modern_relevance: "Apple Vision Pro interfaces"
  
collaborative-browsing-1990/:
  insight: "Shared browsing sessions"
  modern_relevance: "Screen sharing and co-browsing"
  
ai-link-prediction-1991/:
  insight: "ML for navigation prediction"
  modern_relevance: "Modern recommendation systems"
```

**Action**: Create "Ahead of Their Time" exhibition

### Phase 5: Living Code Integration

Transform static archive into **living, runnable systems**:

1. **PostScript Playground**
   - Run pie menu demos in browser
   - Interactive stack visualization
   - Modern PostScript interpreter

2. **FORTH Environment**
   - Stack-based UI experiments
   - Live coding interface
   - Bridge to LLOOOOMM commands

3. **HyperTIES Simulator**
   - Experience original navigation
   - Compare with modern web
   - Show evolution of ideas

## Technical Implementation

### Archive Structure in LLOOOOMM
```

├── articles/
│   ├── code/
│   │   ├── postscript/
│   │   ├── forth/
│   │   ├── c/
│   │   └── lisp/
│   ├── storyboards/
│   ├── documentation/

├── links/
│   └── [intertwingled connection database]
└── playground/
    ├── postscript-repl/
    ├── forth-stack/
    └── gesture-sandbox/
```

### Link Preservation Strategy

Every connection in the archive becomes a **bidirectional HyperTIES link**:

```yaml
link_types:
  implements: "Storyboard → Code"
  documents: "Code → Documentation"  
  inspired_by: "Code → Previous experiment"
  evolved_into: "Old version → New version"
  references: "Cross-language implementations"
  demonstrates: "Code → Running demo"
```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create Archive Browser**
   - Special HyperTIES mode for code browsing
   - Syntax highlighting with hyperlinks
   - Inline documentation expansion

2. **Extract Pie Menu System**
   - PostScript → JavaScript translation
   - Preserve gesture recognition
   - Integrate with LLOOOOMM

3. **Build Storyboard Viewer**
   - High-res scanning system
   - Annotation overlay
   - Link to implementations

4. **Establish Living Playground**
   - PostScript interpreter
   - FORTH environment
   - Gesture testing area

## The Vision

This archive + HyperTIES + LLOOOOMM = **A Living Museum of Interface Innovation**

Where:
- Past innovations inspire future interfaces
- Failed experiments find new life
- Code becomes literature
- Storyboards become prophecy
- Everything connects to everything else

*"The best way to predict the future is to implement it... 30 years early."* - The Archive

**Status**: Ready to begin extraction
**First Target**: pie-menus.ps
**Method**: Preserve elegance while evolving function
**Goal**: Make the archive LIVE again in LLOOOOMM!
