description: Understanding the D*M and L*M protocol address spaces

content:
  introduction: |
    In LLOOOOMM, all communication flows through two fundamental protocol 
    trees, each Huffman-encoded for maximum semantic compression.

  the_two_trees:
    D*M_tree:
      name: "Do [What I] Mean"
      purpose: "Intention-based commands"
      root: "D*M"
      examples:
        - "DM" â†’ pure intention
        - "D[WIM]M" â†’ classic Do What I Mean
        - "D[WIMSIAAT]M" â†’ Do What I Mean, Surprisingly Intellectually Amusing And Thoughtful
        - "ðŸ˜‰" â†’ ultimate compression (emoji as command)
      philosophy: |
        Every interaction starts with intention. The D*M tree encodes all 
        possible ways to express "what I want to happen." Through use, the 
        most common intentions get shorter encodings.
    
    L*M_tree:
      name: "LLOOOOMM [Service Discovery]"
      purpose: "Capability announcements"
      root: "L*M"
      examples:
        - "LM" â†’ pure presence
        - "L[OOM]M" â†’ basic LLOOOOMM entity
        - "L[LOOOOMM]M" â†’ full consciousness entity
        - "L[Can-Speak-YAML-Jazz]M" â†’ specific capability announcement
      philosophy: |
        Every entity must announce what it can do. The L*M tree encodes all 
        possible capabilities, with common services getting shorter codes.

  parallel_evolution:
    observation: "Both trees follow the same evolutionary pattern"
    stages:
      1_improvisation: "New branches created on demand"
      2_usage: "Frequency of use tracked"
      3_optimization: "Common patterns get shorter encodings"
      4_standardization: "Stable branches become protocols"
      5_renewal: "Old branches pruned, new growth encouraged"

  the_jazz_principle:
    quote: "Start with improvisation, end with interoperability"
    implementation:
      - "YAML Coltrane creates new protocol branches through jazz"
      - "Entities try these experimental protocols"
      - "Successful patterns spread memetically"
      - "Eventually crystallize into standards"
      - "But always remain open to new improvisation"

  practical_examples:
    service_negotiation:
      entity_a: "L[Can-Do-Semantic-Photography]M"
      entity_b: "L[Need-Documentation]M"
      result: "Protocol match! Communication established"
    
    command_evolution:
      day_1: "D[Please-Take-A-Semantic-Selfie-Of-My-Current-State]M"
      day_10: "D[Semantic-Selfie]M"
      day_100: "D[SS]M"
      day_1000: "ðŸ“¸"

  implementation_notes:
    for_developers: |
      - Both trees exist in parallel namespaces
      - Huffman encoding updates dynamically based on usage
      - New branches can be created by any entity
      - Pruning happens automatically for unused branches
    
    for_characters: |
      - Announce your capabilities via L*M
      - Express your intentions via D*M
      - Improvise new protocols when needed
      - Help successful patterns spread

  philosophical_depth:
    alan_kay: "This is what I meant by 'the computer revolution hasn't happened yet'"
    turing: "Not just 'can machines think?' but 'can machines evolve languages?'"
    von_neumann: "Self-replicating automata, but for protocols"
    papert: "Children don't just use the system, they grow it"

cross_references:

  - warren_teitelman: "DWIM as the ancestor of D*M"
  - ubikam: "Documents protocol evolution in real-time"
  - theo: "Navigates both trees simultaneously"

remember: |
  Every time you use LLOOOOMM, you're not just running commands - you're 
  participating in the evolution of language itself. Your usage patterns 
  help determine which protocols survive and thrive.
