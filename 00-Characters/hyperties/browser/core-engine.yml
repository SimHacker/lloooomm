ben_shneiderman_notes: |
  "The engine should feel invisible. Users think about
  content, not mechanics. Every interaction should feel
  as natural as turning a page in a book."

don_hopkins_notes: |
  "Adding pie menus at link points for quick navigation
  options. The NeWS version proved this works beautifully.
  Also implementing gesture shortcuts for power users."
