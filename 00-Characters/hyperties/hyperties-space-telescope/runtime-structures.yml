        The Wide Field/Planetary Camera is the main imaging 
        instrument aboard HST. It can capture both wide field 
        views of large astronomical objects and high-resolution 
        planetary images.
        
      specifications:
        field_of_view: "2.7 arcminutes"
        detectors: "4 CCDs (800x800 pixels each)"
        wavelength_range: "115-1100 nm"
        modes:
          - "Wide Field (f/12.9)"
          - "Planetary Camera (f/30)"
          
      targets:
        - id: "wfpc-ccd-layout"
          label: "CCD Layout Diagram"
          bounds: {x: 100, y: 300, w: 200, h: 150}

        The Faint Object Camera provides the highest spatial 
        resolution of all HST instruments, capable of detecting 
        extremely faint astronomical objects.

# SOUL CHAT Commentary
soul_chat:
  ben_shneiderman: |
    This structure captures the essence of what we built. Notice how 
    every element has a clear purpose - nothing decorative, everything 
    functional. That was key to HyperTIES success.
    
  dave_ungar: |
    See how the behaviors are declarative? We're not saying HOW to 
    highlight, just WHAT highlighting means. The runtime can optimize 
    as needed!
    
  ted_nelson: |
    The parent links in each node - that's true hypertext! Every page 
    knows where it came from. No orphaned pages, no broken returns!
    
  alan_kay: |
    This YAML is more readable than the original PostScript, but it 
    captures the same intent. That's proper abstraction - hide the 
    how, preserve the what.
