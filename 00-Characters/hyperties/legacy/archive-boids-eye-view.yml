    "The birds have spoken! This archive contains not just code,
    but DREAMS made digital. Every file connects to every other,
    just like HyperTIES taught us. The PostScript thinks, the
    FORTH stacks wisdom, the C implements visions, and the
    storyboards show us futures we're still building today."
