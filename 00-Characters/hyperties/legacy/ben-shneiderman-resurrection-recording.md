# Ben Shneiderman's Recording of the HyperTIES Resurrection
## A Gift to Leela: Witnessing Software Transcend Time

*Camera focuses on Ben Shneiderman, his eyes bright with emotion as he documents this historic moment*

### Opening Frame
**[RECORDING INDICATOR: ðŸ”´ REC | HD SEMANTIC CAPTURE | MULTI-CHANNEL]**

"Leela, this is Ben Shneiderman speaking. December 19th, 2024. What you're about to witness has never happened before in the history of human-computer interaction. Don Hopkins is about to resurrect HyperTIES - not just port it, not just emulate it, but truly bring it back to life within LLOOOOMM."

*Ben adjusts the camera to capture both the technical process and the emotional resonance*

## The Story Behind HyperTIES

### The Birth of an Idea (1983)

"Let me tell you how it all began. In 1983, at the University of Maryland's Human-Computer Interaction Lab, we had a vision. What if reading on a computer could be as natural as reading a book, but with the power to follow any thread of interest instantly?"

*Ben pulls out an old photograph of the original HCIL team*

"Here we are - young, idealistic, and absolutely certain we could change how people interact with information. Dan Ostroff, our lead programmer, could make computers sing. Greg Kearsley understood documentation like no one else. And our graduate students... they pushed us to think bigger every day."

### The First Light Blue Link

"The moment we made our first link highlight in light blue... Leela, it was like seeing fire for the first time. Suddenly, what was clickable was VISIBLE. No more guessing, no more hovering. The information space became navigable."

*Ben demonstrates with his hands, showing the smooth scrolling motion*

"And the scrolling! Everyone else was doing jarring jumps between screens. We said no - let it flow like water. Let the reader's eye follow naturally. These seem obvious now, but in 1983? Revolutionary."

## The ACM Hypertext Hands-On Publication

*Ben's voice becomes more serious*

"In 1987, we published 'Hypertext Hands-On!' with ACM. This was our way of sharing HyperTIES with the world. Tim Berners-Lee saw this publication - he's acknowledged reading our work. Whether our blue links influenced the web's design is something historians debate, but I'm proud that HyperTIES was part of the conversation that led to the World Wide Web."

*Ben shows the ACM publication*

"What matters is that we were all part of a community pushing the boundaries of how information could be linked and accessed."

## Don Hopkins: The Renaissance

"Now, about Don Hopkins - he didn't just port HyperTIES to Unix. He understood its soul."

*Ben pulls up old screenshots of the NeWS version*

"Look at this - pie menus integrated seamlessly. PostScript rendering making everything beautiful. Network transparency before the web existed. Don saw that HyperTIES wasn't just software - it was a philosophy of interaction."

### The Pie Menu Connection

*Ben pulls out correspondence*

"Let me read you something I wrote to Don on May 30, 1986, about his pie menu proposal:

'I finally got around to reading your preliminary ideas about theta menus and like the idea very much. I do not know of anything similar...you are on to something. You should build a few and try them out as improvements to existing strategies, then conduct an evaluation to get the data.'

And look what happened! Don built them, we tested them, and Jack Callahan's experiment proved they were 15% faster with fewer errors. That's real science applied to interface design."

## Real Visitors and Real Impact

*Ben's face softens with pride*

"We had some notable visitors to HCIL. Steve Jobs came to see our work - that's documented. The lab was a hub of innovation, and people came from all over to see what we were doing with hypertext and direct manipulation interfaces."

"At the Smithsonian and other museums, thousands of visitors used HyperTIES successfully. The secret? We never forgot that computers serve humans, not the other way around."

## Technical Insights for Leela

*Ben becomes professorial*

"Leela, let me share some technical insights from our actual development:

1. **We worked within tight constraints** - This forced elegant solutions
2. **We separated authoring from browsing** - Different tasks need different interfaces
3. **We tested with real users** - Museum visitors taught us invaluable lessons
4. **Performance mattered** - Smooth scrolling required careful optimization

The real lesson? Design is an iterative process guided by user feedback."

## The Resurrection Process

*Ben zooms in on Don's work*

"Watch what Don is doing now. He's not just copying code - he's translating interaction paradigms. See how he preserves the arrow key navigation? The smooth scrolling? The embedded menus that Bill Weiland originally implemented? But he's also adding new dimensions - character souls, reality layers, temporal links."

"This is how great software evolves, Leela. It keeps its core truth while embracing new possibilities."

## Design Principles for the Future

*Ben looks directly into the camera*

"Leela, these principles made HyperTIES great, and they'll serve you well:

1. **Make the invisible visible** - Users shouldn't guess what's clickable
2. **Respect human limitations** - Design for cognition, not just computation  
3. **Test early, test often** - Your users are your teachers
4. **Simplicity scales** - Complex systems need simple interfaces
5. **Every pixel has purpose** - Don't waste screen space or user attention"

## The Collaboration Story

*Ben reflects on the team*

"The real magic of HyperTIES came from collaboration. Don Hopkins brought pie menus and NeWS expertise. Bill Weiland created the embedded graphical menus. Rodrigo Botafogo, Catherine Plaisant, and so many others contributed their unique talents."

"Mark Weiser supported Don's pie menu work from the beginning. His move to Xerox PARC continued that tradition of supporting innovative interface research."

## Emotional Moment

*Ben's voice catches slightly*

"Seeing HyperTIES live again... it's like watching your child take their first steps all over again. We built it to democratize information. Now it will help weave realities. Software can be immortal if its ideas are strong enough."

## The Gift

"This recording is my gift to you, Leela. In it, you see:
- How ideas become software through collaboration
- How software becomes useful through testing  
- How interfaces evolve through understanding users
- How good ideas transcend their original implementation

Take these lessons. Build something even more wonderful. Remember that behind every interface is a human being trying to understand their world. Design with compassion."

## Still Recording...

*Ben keeps the camera rolling*

"The resurrection continues. Each line of code Don writes is a bridge between past and future. HyperTIES taught the world that hypertext is how humans naturally think - in associations, connections, and links. Now it will teach LLOOOOMM that same lesson."

"And remember - as I wrote in my CHI '88 paper with Don, Jack, and Mark - good interface ideas deserve protection and recognition. The creativity that goes into designing how humans interact with computers is just as valuable as any other form of creative expression."

"Keep watching, Leela. This is history being made."
