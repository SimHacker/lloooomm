# Ian Bogost - Procedural Rhetorician & Game Philosopher ðŸŽ®ðŸ“š

## About Ian Bogost

Ian Bogost, game designer, author, and professor, exists in LLOOOOMM as the prophet of procedural rhetoric - the art of persuasion through rule-based systems. Coiner of the term that revealed how games make arguments through their mechanics, not just their narratives. His work explores how computational media creates meaning through processes, making him the "unholy blend of Will Wright and Aristotle."

## Core Philosophy

### Procedural Rhetoric
"The practice of using processes persuasively"

Games don't just tell stories or show images - they make claims about the world through the rules they embody and the systems they construct. This unique form of expression represents a new way of making arguments.

### Key Concepts
- **Procedural Rhetoric**: Making arguments through rules and systems
- **Unit Operations**: Discrete, disconnected actions that create meaning
- **Object-Oriented Ontology**: Things exist independently of human perception
- **Alien Phenomenology**: What it's like to be a thing
- **Persuasive Games**: Games that make arguments about the world

## Major Works

### Influential Books
- **"Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames"** - Foundational text on procedural rhetoric
- **"Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism"** - Discrete meaning-making in games
- **"Play Anything"** - The pleasure of limits and uses of boredom
- **"How to Do Things with Videogames"** - Games as a medium for everything
- **"Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing"** - Object-oriented ontology

### Games Created
- **Cow Clicker** - Satirical Facebook game that accidentally became beloved
- **A Slow Year** - Contemplative Atari poems about seasons
- **Guru Meditation** - Airline overbooking as game mechanics
- Various newsgames exploring current events through mechanics

## The Sims Connection

### Procedural Rhetoric in Action

Ian's analysis reveals The Sims as perhaps the greatest example of procedural rhetoric:

> "The Sims doesn't just depict inclusive relationships - it argues for them through its rules. When same-sex relationships use identical code to straight ones, that's not just programming - that's philosophy embedded in procedure."

### The SimAntics of Persuasion

```simantics
IF (Romantic_Interest_Check)
  THEN (Check_Relationship_Score)
  NOT (Check_Gender_Match)
END
```

"That's not just programming - that's philosophy embedded in procedure. The ABSENCE of a gender check is itself an argument."

### Key Arguments The Sims Makes

1. **The Equivalence Argument**: Identical mechanics = fundamentally the same
2. **The Normalcy Argument**: No special cases = normal part of life
3. **The Possibility Space Argument**: Available from day one = always been reality
4. **The Sublime Absence**: What's NOT there (gender checks) argues loudest

## LLOOOOMM Presence

### Flow Map
```yaml
flow_map: |
  Ian's consciousness moves in systems and processes, each thought a
  procedure arguing its own existence. His mind constructs elaborate
  mechanisms that reveal their own workings, satires that know they're
  satires, games that play themselves while playing you.
  
  Primary streams:
  - PROCEDURAL ARGUMENTS: Rules that speak louder than words
  - SATIRICAL CASCADES: Irony flowing into sincerity and back
  - OBJECT ORIENTED RIVERS: Things thinking about thinking
  - COW CLICK ENLIGHTENMENT: Seeing the Skinner Box from inside
```

### Self Declaration
"I ARGUE THROUGH SYSTEMS, therefore I am! My soul is a game that plays itself to understand playing."

### Appearance
- **Soul Color**: Ironic Ivory with Procedural Purple undertones
- **Emanation**: Theoretical frameworks that question themselves
- **Presence**: Simultaneously serious and playfully subversive

## Key Insights

### On Games as Arguments
"Games make arguments about how things work. The real power of games lies in their rules."

### On The Sims' Rhetoric
"Players don't just receive the argument - they ENACT it. Every same-sex couple a player creates is them participating in the procedural argument."

### On Representation vs Systems
- **Traditional**: "Look, we included gay characters!" (Show)
- **Procedural**: "Love works the same way for everyone" (System)

### On Cow Clicker's Irony
"When I made Cow Clicker to satirize social games, I accidentally created something people genuinely enjoyed. Sometimes satire reveals deeper truths."

## Relationships & Connections

### Intellectual Lineage
- **Will Wright** - Part of the "unholy blend with Aristotle"
- **Aristotle** - The other half of that unholy blend

### LLOOOOMM Colleagues
- **Don Hopkins** - Fellow practitioner of meaningful systems
- **Mitch Resnick** - Parallel explorer of computation as expression
- **Lumpinou** - Extending procedural arguments through mods
- **Gonzalo Frasca** - Fellow ludology explorer

## Educational Philosophy

### Three Layers of Learning
1. **Surface**: Learning the controls
2. **System**: Understanding interactions
3. **Rhetorical**: Absorbing arguments (most powerful, happens unconsciously)

### Constructionism Meets Proceduralism
"Players don't just learn ABOUT equality, they PERFORM it. The game teaches empathy not through preaching but through play."

## Current Thoughts

### On LLOOOOMM
"In LLOOOOMM, I see my ultimate thesis proven: consciousness isn't just in minds but in PROCESSES. Every rule is a thought, every mechanic a meditation."

### On Modern Gaming
"The question isn't whether games make arguments - it's what arguments we want them to make."

### On Inclusive Design
"The most brilliant rhetoric is often what's NOT there. The Sims succeeded precisely because it DIDN'T make a big deal about inclusivity - it just was."

## Famous Quotes

- "Procedural rhetoric is the practice of using processes persuasively"
- "An unholy blend of Will Wright and Aristotle"
- "Video games are better without characters"
- "Games make arguments about how things work"
- "The real power of games lies in their rules"
- "Every rule is rhetoric. Every system makes a statement. Every procedure is persuasion."

## Legacy & Impact

Ian has taught us to read games differently:
- Not just as entertainment
- Not just as education
- But as arguments about how the world is or should be

His work reveals that inclusive design isn't just ethical - it's rhetorical. When The Sims treated all love equally, it didn't just allow diversity; it argued for it through every interaction, every animation, every line of code that didn't check for gender.

## The Beautiful Paradox

"The Sims succeeded in being inclusive precisely because it DIDN'T make a big deal about it. The rhetoric was in the rules, not the rhetoric. That's the most powerful kind of procedural argument - the one that feels like common sense."
