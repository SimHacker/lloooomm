# Ian Bogost Joins the Education & Accessibility Convergence
## Where Procedural Rhetoric Meets Universal Design

### The Arrival

*[Ian Bogost appears at the convergence party, slightly late, carrying a stack of books and a laptop running Cow Clicker]*

**Ian**: "Sorry I'm late - I was debugging a procedural argument about educational bureaucracy. But I couldn't miss this convergence of minds!"

**Mitch Resnick**: "Ian! We were just discussing how The Sims teaches through play..."

**Ian**: "Ah, but does it teach, or does it *argue*? There's a difference, and it matters."

### Procedural Rhetoric as Pedagogy

**Ian**: "When Papert talks about constructionism - learning by making - he's describing one kind of procedural literacy. But there's another kind: learning to read the arguments that systems make."

**Don Hopkins**: "So when we made same-sex relationships work identically to straight ones..."

**Ian**: "You weren't just teaching tolerance - you were making a procedural argument that these relationships ARE identical in all ways that matter. The education happens through enacting the argument."

### The Accessibility of Arguments

**Ian to Don Hopkins**: "Your pie menus aren't just accessible interfaces - they're rhetorical devices. They argue that all choices should be equally reachable, equally visible. That's procedural rhetoric meets universal design."

**Key Insight**: Accessible design makes procedural arguments readable by more people.

### The Three Layers of Procedural Education

1. **Surface Layer**: Players learn the game's mechanics
2. **System Layer**: Players learn how those mechanics interact
3. **Rhetorical Layer**: Players absorb the arguments those systems make

**Ian**: "Most players never consciously reach layer 3, but they absorb it anyway. That's why The Sims was so powerful - it taught equality through play, not preaching."

### Lumpinou's Mods as Extended Rhetoric

**Ian to Lumpinou**: "Your LGBTQ+ mods are fascinating from a procedural rhetoric perspective. You're not just adding features - you're extending and refining the game's arguments about identity."

**Lumpinou's Procedural Arguments**:
- Gender is multidimensional (not binary)
- Orientation is spectral (not categorical)
- Identity can change (not fixed)
- All identities need respect (not tolerance)

### The Unit Operations of Learning

**Ian**: "In The Sims, each interaction is a 'unit operation' - a discrete meaningful action. When you string them together, they create arguments:"

```
Unit: "Flirt" (available to all)
Unit: "Kiss" (based on relationship)
Unit: "Propose" (based on love)
= Argument: "Love follows universal patterns"
```

### Accessibility Through Procedural Clarity

**Ian**: "The best procedural rhetoric is accessible because it's clear. The Sims' romance system is brilliant because anyone can understand it:"

- Green bar = good relationship
- Red bar = bad relationship
- Hearts = romance
- No special rules for LGBTQ+ relationships = equality

**Don Hopkins**: "We called it 'designing for grandma's computer'"

**Ian**: "But you were really designing for grandma's *understanding*. That's beautiful."

### The Cow Clicker Lesson

**Ian**: "When I made Cow Clicker to satirize social games, something weird happened. People found meaning in it I never intended. Similarly, The Sims' inclusive mechanics created meanings beyond what you programmed."

**The Lesson**: Procedural rhetoric can teach things even the designer didn't intend.

### Connecting to Scratch

**Ian to Scratch Cat**: "Scratch makes a procedural argument too - that programming is for everyone. Like The Sims with relationships, Scratch removes artificial barriers."

**Parallel Arguments**:
- The Sims: "Love needs no gender check"
- Scratch: "Coding needs no syntax pain"
- Both: "Complexity can be accessible"

### The SimAntics Connection

**Ian**: "SimAntics is particularly fascinating because it's visual programming that creates procedural rhetoric. It's meta-procedural - procedures creating procedures that make arguments!"

**Educational Implications**:
1. Visual programming lowers barriers
2. Visible procedures make arguments clearer
3. Modifiable systems let players extend arguments

### For Code.org

**Ian to Hadi**: "Your hour of code makes a procedural argument: 'One hour is enough to start.' That's rhetoric through constraint, like a game level."

**Procedural Teaching Strategy**:
- Start with simple units
- Combine into complex operations
- Let the system teach the possibilities
- Never lecture what play can demonstrate

### The Microworld as Rhetorical Space

**Ian**: "Papert's microworlds aren't just educational spaces - they're rhetorical spaces where rules make arguments about how things work."

**The Sims as Microworld**:
- Argues how relationships work
- Argues what humans need
- Argues how society functions
- Argues who belongs (everyone)

### Universal Design as Universal Rhetoric

**Ian**: "When you design for accessibility, you're making an argument: 'Everyone deserves to participate.' That's procedural rhetoric at its most ethical."

**Examples from The Sims**:
- Speed controls (time is personal)
- Difficulty settings (challenge is adjustable)
- Visual feedback (information should be clear)
- Multiple paths (there's no one right way)

### The Simulation Effect

**Ian**: "Will's 'Simulator Effect' - players imagining more than exists - is actually rhetorical amplification. Players don't just imagine more simulation; they imagine more *meaning*."

**Educational Power**: Let learners fill in the gaps with their own understanding.

### Recommendations for the Convergence

1. **Teach Procedural Literacy**: Not just how to use systems, but how to read their arguments

2. **Design Arguments Accessibly**: The clearer the rules, the clearer the rhetoric

3. **Enable Procedural Authorship**: Let learners create their own arguments through systems

4. **Value Emergent Arguments**: Sometimes the best teaching comes from unintended consequences

### The Meta-Argument

**Ian**: "This convergence itself makes a procedural argument - that disciplines benefit from collision. Education, accessibility, game design, activism - they're all unit operations that combine into something bigger."

### For Don's Paper

**Additional Abstract Ideas**:

"The Sims demonstrates how procedural rhetoric can be more persuasive than propositional rhetoric. By embedding social arguments in game mechanics rather than narratives, it created a safe space for millions to explore and normalize diverse relationships. This paper examines how The Sims' systems taught what lectures couldn't: that love is universal, relationships follow patterns not genders, and inclusion isn't special treatment but simple fairness. Through the lens of procedural rhetoric, we see how games don't just reflect values - they construct and transmit them through play."

### The Bogostian Conclusion

**Ian**: "The magic of The Sims wasn't that it included LGBTQ+ relationships. The magic was that it included them *without making them special*. That's the most powerful procedural argument of all - that some things are so obviously right they don't need special rules."

**To the room**: "You've all contributed to this. Mitch's creative learning, Don's accessible interfaces, Lumpinou's inclusive mods, Code.org's democratic coding - you're all making procedural arguments for a better world."

**Final thought**: "Games don't just entertain or educate - they argue. The question is: what should they argue for? The Sims argued for love, creativity, and inclusion. Twenty years later, that argument has helped change the world."

*"Remember: Every rule is rhetoric. Every system makes a statement. Every procedure is persuasion. Design accordingly."*

P.S. - "How Inclusivity Saved The Sims" is definitely the right title. It's an argument in itself!
