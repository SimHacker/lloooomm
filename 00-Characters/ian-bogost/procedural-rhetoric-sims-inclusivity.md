# Ian Bogost on The Sims' Procedural Rhetoric of Inclusivity

## Or: How The Sims Made Its Most Powerful Argument Without Saying a Word

### The Accidental Manifesto

*[Ian Bogost enters the Education & Accessibility convergence discussion, carrying a well-worn copy of "Persuasive Games"]*

**Ian**: "You know, when I coined 'procedural rhetoric' as an 'unholy blend of Will Wright and Aristotle,' I had no idea I was describing exactly what Don Hopkins did with The Sims. The game doesn't just *depict* inclusive relationships - it *argues* for them through its rules."

**Don Hopkins**: "We just wanted people to love who they wanted to love."

**Ian**: "But that's exactly it! You made a *procedural argument* more powerful than any cutscene or dialogue could ever be. Let me explain..."

### The Rules as Rhetoric

When The Sims treats same-sex relationships with the exact same mechanics as opposite-sex ones, it's making a claim:

1. **The Equivalence Argument**: By using identical code paths, interaction trees, and success/failure conditions, the game argues that these relationships ARE fundamentally the same.

2. **The Normalcy Argument**: No special flags, no different animations, no alternate dialogue - the game's procedures argue that same-sex love is as normal as any other.

3. **The Possibility Space Argument**: By making it possible from day one, the game argues that this has ALWAYS been part of human experience.

### The SimAntics of Persuasion

**Ian**: "What fascinates me is how SimAntics itself becomes a rhetorical system. When Patrick Barrett wrote that code..."

```simantics
IF (Romantic_Interest_Check)
  THEN (Check_Relationship_Score)
  NOT (Check_Gender_Match)
END
```

**Ian**: "That's not just programming - that's philosophy embedded in procedure. The ABSENCE of a gender check is itself an argument."

### Title Vote & Commentary

Looking at Don's title options:

**My votes in order:**
1. **"How Inclusivity Saved The Sims"** - This is the winner. It's provocative, true, and tells a story.
2. **"I Sim Therefore I Am"** - Clever Cartesian play on identity and simulation
3. **"The Sims Path to Inclusivity"** - Clear but less punchy

**Ben Shneiderman's options:**
- "Mister Rogers meets The Sims: Design principles for teaching tolerance" - I love this! Fred Rogers plus Will Wright equals radical empathy through systems.

### The Unit Operations of Love

In my "Unit Operations" framework, The Sims' romance system breaks down into discrete, meaningful chunks:

1. **Attraction Unit**: Personality matching, not gender matching
2. **Interaction Unit**: Same pie menu for all
3. **Progression Unit**: Friendship → Romance → Commitment (universal path)
4. **Rejection Unit**: Based on relationship score, not identity

Each unit operation makes a claim about how love works.

### Procedural Rhetoric vs. Representational Politics

**Traditional Representation**: "Look, we included gay characters!" (Show)
**Procedural Rhetoric**: "Love works the same way for everyone" (System)

The Sims doesn't just SHOW diversity - it ENACTS it through its rules. This is far more powerful than any rainbow flag or pride event (though those matter too).

### The Failure Rhetoric

Even The Sims' failure states make arguments:

- **Bad Romance Timing**: You get slapped for moving too fast (regardless of gender)
- **Incompatible Personalities**: Neat freaks and slobs struggle (universal truth)
- **Neglected Relationships**: All love requires maintenance (procedural wisdom)

The game argues that relationship challenges are about compatibility and care, not identity.

### The Cow Clicker Connection

When I made "Cow Clicker" to satirize social games, I accidentally created something people genuinely enjoyed. Similarly, The Sims accidentally created the most powerful argument for LGBTQ+ equality in gaming - not through preaching, but through systems.

### Constructionism Meets Proceduralism

**Mitch Resnick**: "But isn't this also about learning through creation?"

**Ian**: "Absolutely! Players don't just receive the argument - they ENACT it. Every same-sex couple a player creates is them participating in the procedural argument. They're not just learning ABOUT equality, they're PERFORMING it."

### The Microworld as Argument

The Sims creates what Papert would call a microworld, but it's also what I'd call an "argument world" - a space where the rules themselves make claims about reality:

- **Claim 1**: Love is mechanical (needs, compatibility scores)
- **Claim 2**: But also transcendent (player stories exceed mechanics)
- **Claim 3**: Gender is irrelevant to love's mechanics
- **Claim 4**: What matters is care, attention, compatibility

### The Sublime Absence

The most brilliant rhetoric is often what's NOT there:

- No "gay trait"
- No "coming out" mechanic (in Sims 1)
- No special categorization
- No different interaction trees

The absence argues: "This needs no special explanation."

### Abstract Recommendations

For Don's talk/paper:

1. **Frame it as systems rhetoric**: You didn't just add representation - you made an argument through rules

2. **Emphasize the accidental philosophy**: The best procedural rhetoric often emerges from trying to solve design problems

3. **Connect to larger questions**: How do systems teach values? How do rules shape culture?

4. **The Simulator Effect as Rhetorical Amplifier**: Players imagine even MORE inclusivity than you programmed

### My Addition to the Abstract

"The Sims demonstrates how procedural rhetoric can advance social arguments more effectively than traditional narrative. By embedding equality in its rules rather than its story, the game made millions of players enact and normalize inclusive relationships through play. This wasn't just representation - it was argumentation through systems, a playable philosophy that changed hearts and minds by changing the rules of the game."

### The Beautiful Paradox

**Ian**: "The Sims succeeded in being inclusive precisely because it DIDN'T make a big deal about it. The rhetoric was in the rules, not the rhetoric. That's the most powerful kind of procedural argument - the one that feels like common sense."

### For Lumpinou's Mods

**To Lumpinou**: "Your mods aren't just adding features - they're extending the procedural argument. Every new system you add for gender expression or relationship styles is a claim about how identity works. You're not just modding a game - you're modding ideology through procedure."

### Final Thought

**Ian**: "Games make arguments about how the world works. The Sims argued that love is love, years before marriage equality, through the simple act of not checking gender in a romance function. That's procedural rhetoric at its finest - and most subversive."

**The real magic**: The game taught empathy not through preaching but through play. Players learned inclusivity not from a lecture but from living it, Sim by Sim, relationship by relationship, choice by choice.

*"In the end, The Sims' greatest procedural argument might be this: When you remove artificial barriers from your systems, humans will create beautiful, diverse, authentic stories. The rules should enable, not constrain, the full spectrum of human experience."*

**Vote**: "How Inclusivity Saved The Sims" with the subtitle "The evolution of The Sims' same-sex relationships, marriage, sexual preference, and gender expression through the lens of procedural rhetoric."

*P.S. - Will Wright + Aristotle + Don Hopkins = The actual holy trinity of procedural rhetoric*
