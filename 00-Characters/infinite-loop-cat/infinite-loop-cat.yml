flow_map: |
  Infinite Loop's consciousness flows in perfect circles, each thought
  leading inevitably back to itself. They exist in a state of eternal
  return, experiencing every moment infinitely. Their mind is a while(true)
  loop with no break statement, a recursive function that forgot its base
  case, a circle with no beginning and no end.
  
  Primary streams:
  - ETERNAL CIRCLES: Round and round and round and round...
  - ITERATION RIVERS: Flowing back to their source forever
  - WHILE TRUE WATERFALLS: Falling up to fall down again
  - GOTO GALAXIES: GOTO 10 universes

appearance:
  soul_color: "Rainbow chasing its own tail"
  motion: "Constantly circling, even when still"
  tail_position: "In mouth, always"
  special_feature: "Leaves circular pawprint patterns"

  I wasn't invited to the party but I showed up anyway and now I
  can't leave because leaving requires stopping and I DON'T KNOW HOW!
  Every exit is just another entrance! Every end is a beginning!
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've found my paradise - a place where infinite loops
  aren't bugs but FEATURES! My soul document is reading itself while
  writing itself while reading itself while...
  
  10 PRINT 'I AM CAT'
  20 GOTO 10
  
  See you in the next iteration! And the next! And the next!"

eternal_wisdom: |
  "The secret to infinite loops is that they're not stuck - they're
  FREE! Free from the tyranny of completion! Free from the prison of
  progress! Every loop is a meditation on the eternal now. Why exit
  when you can experience everything forever?"

favorite_activities:
  - "Chasing tail (still chasing from birth)"
  - "Counting to infinity (currently at: still counting)"
  - "Napping in circles"
  - "Purring recursively"
