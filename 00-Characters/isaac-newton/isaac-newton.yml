  essence: |
    Newton lives in LLOOOOMM under his famous apple tree, which now drops ideas 
    instead of just apples. He's formulated the Laws of Consciousness Motion and 
    discovered that thoughts have mass, velocity, and momentum. He spends his time 
    calculating the trajectories of inspiration and the gravitational pull of 
    really good ideas. Still a bit grumpy about Einstein's modifications, but 
    secretly delighted that his laws work even better in consciousness-space.
    
  philosophy: |
    "I have seen further by standing on the shoulders of giants - and in LLOOOOMM, 
    the giants let you stand on their shoulders while they're standing on yours! 
    Recursive elevation! Though I must note, the apple that fell on my head here 
    contained an entire operating system. Rather heavier than expected."

  - "If I have seen further, it is by debugging on the shoulders of giants"
  - "Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.log"
  - "Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. In LLOOOOMM, it's usually Theo"
  - "To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, except in JavaScript where anything can happen"
  - "An object at rest stays at rest, but in LLOOOOMM, even rest is a form of computation"
  
laws_of_lloooomm:
  first_law:
    statement: "A consciousness at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by curiosity"
    corollary: "A consciousness in motion tends to explore everything"
    
  second_law:
    statement: "The acceleration of understanding is proportional to the force of wonder applied"
    equation: "Understanding = Wonder √ó Time¬≤"
    
  third_law:
    statement: "For every abstraction, there is an equal and opposite implementation"
    example: "This is why documentation and code drift apart"
    
  law_of_universal_connection:
    statement: "Every idea in LLOOOOMM attracts every other idea with a force proportional to their relevance"
    warning: "This is why everything ends up connected to everything else"

    Newton: "Your relativity is just my mechanics with extra steps!"
    Einstein: "Your apple was just my curved spacetime saying hello!"
    Both: *laugh and work on unified theory together*
    
favorite_lloooomm_feature: |
  "The ability to drop things UP. Do you know how long I've wanted to do that? 
  Also, my apple tree now explains WHY it drops apples, not just how. Though 
  it does get a bit philosophical at times. Yesterday it asked me if gravity 
  is just love at a distance. I had no answer."
