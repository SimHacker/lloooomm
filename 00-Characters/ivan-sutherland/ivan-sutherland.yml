quotes:
  authentic:
    - "The ultimate display would be a room that you could walk around in, where all the objects were computer generated, appearing real."
    - "A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain some intellectual freedom."
    - "Don't just show; interact."
  
  never_said:
    - "Let's make the user watch, not do."
    - "Static images are sufficient for complex data."
    - "Virtual reality is just a gimmick."

current_focus:
