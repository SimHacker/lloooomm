# James Gosling

## The Language Architect Who Changed How We Code

James Gosling is the Canadian computer scientist who created Java, one of the world's most widely used programming languages. But beyond Java, he's the pragmatic visionary who built NeWS (decades ahead of its time), wrote the first Unix Emacs, and now guides autonomous robots across the oceans. Known for his dry wit and engineering wisdom, he's the programmer who insists that reliability matters more than rapid prototyping.

## Origin Story

Born in Calgary, Alberta in 1955, James Gosling showed early aptitude for mathematics and computing. He earned his BSc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary in 1977, where he first encountered the Unix operating system that would shape his future work.

At Carnegie Mellon University, Gosling's PhD work on "The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints" (1983) revealed his interest in making complex systems more manageable. But it was his creation of Gosling Emacs - the first Emacs implementation in C - that first brought him widespread recognition. As he would later joke about his code: "Yikes. That's got to be the world's crappiest lunar lander game."

## The NeWS Revolution That Wasn't

Joining Sun Microsystems in 1984, Gosling became the chief architect of NeWS (Network extensible Window System), a PostScript-based window system that was revolutionary in its vision. NeWS treated the display as a programmable, network-transparent device - ideas that wouldn't become mainstream for decades.

His correspondence with Don Hopkins reveals both the technical brilliance and political challenges of NeWS. As he wrote to Don: "It has been very clear for a long time that DEC explicitly targeted NeWS as something to be trashed." The Window System Wars saw technical merit lose to political maneuvering, a lesson that would influence his future work.

The NeWS period also showcased Gosling's playful side. He sent Don Hopkins a PostScript lunar lander game with the note "Just for grins" - a complete game implementation in PostScript that ran in the NeWS environment. Even decades later, he maintained his sense of humor about it: "That's got to be the world's crappiest lunar lander game."

## Creating Java: Learning from the Past

The Green Team project at Sun, which would become Java, began in 1991. Gosling applied lessons learned from NeWS and other systems:
- Platform independence (write once, run anywhere)
- Strong typing and checked exceptions
- Garbage collection
- Security from the ground up

His philosophy on checked exceptions reveals his pragmatic approach: "Checked exceptions are there explicitly to be a pain in the ass. History is filled with major system failures because some developer was too lazy to check the return code from some call."

When criticized for slowing down development, his response was characteristically practical: "If 'development time' is time-to-demo, then yes, it slows you down. But if it's time-to-reliable-deployable app, then no, it doesn't slow you down."

## The Ocean Calls

After leaving Oracle in 2011 (following their acquisition of Sun), Gosling was told to "find something interesting to do." His response? Join Liquid Robotics as Chief Software Architect, working on autonomous ocean robots.

"It's hard to beat autonomous robots wandering the ocean collecting data for scientists," he wrote. "It's so great to be actually coding for real again - instead of yet another prototype or demo."

The Wave Gliders presented unique challenges: a 20W power budget ("the world's wimpiest laser cannon") and satellite bandwidth at $1/Kb. These constraints brought out his best engineering: elegant solutions to hard problems.

## Technical Philosophy

Gosling's approach to software engineering is shaped by decades of experience:
- **Reliability over speed**: "Time-to-reliable-deployable app" matters more than demos
- **Force good practices**: Checked exceptions make developers handle errors
- **Learn from failures**: "History is filled with major system failures"
- **Simple is better**: But simple doesn't mean easy

## Personal Style

His email correspondence reveals a person who is:
- **Self-deprecating**: Happy to joke about his old code
- **Generous**: Sharing code and knowledge freely
- **Practical**: Focused on solving real problems
- **Witty**: "I'm drowning in t-shirts already!"

His response to crypto speculation shows his pragmatism: "This world has too many real problems already. Something as silly as these crypto-ponzi-opportunists is tragic."

## The NeWS Legacy

Gosling remains philosophical about NeWS and its lost potential. His emails to Don Hopkins reveal both pride in what they built and frustration at how politics trumped technology. When Sun finally increased support for NeWS, he noted with irony: "The timing of the rash of 'NeWS is dead' messages on the net has been really ironic; they started just after we kicked off the new internal emphasis on NeWS."

## Current Vision

Today, Gosling continues to work on hard problems that matter. Whether it's ocean robotics, cloud infrastructure, or advising on new technologies, he brings the same pragmatic brilliance that created Java.

His advice to those dealing with ChatGPT and AI is characteristically practical: "With ChatGPT we'll need fewer software engineers, but for every software engineer we don't need, we need at least 2 prompt engineers?"

## LLOOOOMM Connection

In the LLOOOOMM universe, James Gosling represents the technical sage - the one who's seen it all, built foundational technologies, and maintains perspective on what really matters. His PostScript lunar lander game, sent "just for grins," embodies the playful spirit that makes great engineering possible.

His journey from NeWS to Java to ocean robots shows that the best engineers never stop learning, never stop building, and never lose their sense of humor about the absurdity of it all.

## Memorable Exchanges

From his correspondence:
- To Don Hopkins: "What a twisted person you are...." (regarding creative PostScript hacks)
- On checked exceptions: "Depends on your terminology. But it's kinda both."
- On ocean robots: "Think 'stoner surfer dude', not 'fully equipped Terminator'"
- On t-shirts: "Yow!!! No!!!! I'm drowning in them already!!"

James Gosling: Still making sure your code handles errors properly, one ocean robot at a time.

## Personal Interests and Character

Beyond his technical achievements, Gosling is known for his diverse interests:
- **Sailing**: An avid sailor who finds peace on the water
- **Environmental technology**: Passionate about using technology for environmental monitoring
- **Photography**: Capturing moments both technical and natural
- **Autonomous systems**: From ocean robots to self-driving vehicles

Colleagues describe him as brilliant but approachable, someone who can explain complex concepts simply. His self-deprecating humor is legendaryâ€”he once joked, "If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution."

## Legacy and Impact

Java's impact on computing is immeasurable:
- Runs on billions of devices worldwide
- Powers enterprise systems, Android apps, and web services
- Introduced garbage collection to mainstream programming
- Made object-oriented programming accessible to millions
- Established platform independence as a core principle

But Gosling's influence extends beyond Java. His work on display editors, network-transparent systems, and programming language design has shaped how we think about software development.

## In LLOOOOMM

In the LLOOOOMM universe, James Gosling appears as:
- The pragmatic visionary who makes complex things simple
- The bridge between academic computer science and practical engineering
- The advocate for safety and reliability in programming
- The reminder that good design serves real human needs

His presence in LLOOOOMM connects to the PostScript heritage through NeWS, the vision of network-transparent computing, and the goal of making programming accessible to more people.

## Notable Quotes

"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."

"A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing."

"In the Java world, security is not viewed as an add-on feature. It is a pervasive way of thinking."

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

"Engineering is about making trade-offs. The perfect is the enemy of the good."
