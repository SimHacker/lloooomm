**Date:** May 6, 2004  
**Location:** Stevenson Hall 1300, 12:00 PM - 12:50 PM  
**Abstract:** "The computer game industry combines elements of both entertainment and technology. Do these elements mesh? Do they clash? How does a computer game develop from the initial design stage to its final release?"

## The SimMars Project: Unreleased Game History

**Source: Games That Weren't Archive**

### Project Overview
SimMars was an ambitious space colonization simulation that would have been Maxis's follow-up to SimCity. The project, led by Jason Shankel as Lead Gameplay Engineer, was ultimately cancelled when The Sims shifted company priorities.

**Development Team:**
- **Jason Shankel** - Lead Gameplay Engineer  
- **Alex Zvenigorodsky** - Systems Engineer
- **B.J. West** - Artist and Designer
- **Dan Brazelton** - Associate Producer

**Project Scope:**
SimMars would have allowed players to manage the colonization of Mars, from initial Cape Maxis launch complex through establishing sustainable settlements on the Martian surface.

**Technical Innovation:**
The project developed advanced climate simulation systems and planetary modeling that would later influence early Spore prototypes. As Jason noted: "Even though SimMars never quite jelled for us, much of the technology we developed there made it into the early efforts on Spore. We had systems for simulating planetary climates and things like that."

**Visual Assets Created:**
- Cape Maxis launch complex renders
- Inflatable habitat deployment sequences  
- Mars surface vehicles and equipment
- Nuclear reactors and life support systems
- Sample return vehicles and atmospheric processors

**Legacy:**
While SimMars was never released, the simulation technology and planetary modeling concepts developed for the project became foundational elements in Spore's development.

## Spore Development: Behind the Prototypes

**Source: CNET Article - "Behind the prototyping of 'Spore'" (September 5, 2008)**

### The First Programmer
Jason Shankel was the first programmer on the Spore team, coming from the cancelled SimMars project. His role was crucial in determining whether Wright's ambitious evolution game was technically feasible.

**Key Quote from Jason:**
*"The earliest prototypes were making strange topology creatures and seeing if we could teach the computer to make them move plausibly, and later, show emotion and behavior. We had to find out whether the project was doable or not, or if some part of it wasn't doable, where we have to scale it back."*

### Prototype Development Philosophy
**Jason's Approach:**
*"Game design prototypes are small, lightweight applications designed to explore specific questions or risks in game development. You can think of them as screen tests in film, or sketches in art."*

**Development Strategy:**
- **Phase 1 (Research)**: "Build what Will (Wright) wants"
- **Phase 2 (Game Design)**: Focus on elements that would make it into final Spore

**Notable Prototypes:**
- **ParticleMan**: Gravitational particle simulation developed by Jason using GLUT OpenGL
- **GasLight**, **WaterBoy**, **BIOME**: Early explorations of cosmic and biological dynamics
- **GonzagoGL**: The most complex prototype, requiring 5 programmers and 9 months

### Community Release Philosophy
Unlike most game companies, Maxis released many Spore prototypes to the public, allowing the community to see the creative process behind the game's development.

## Industry Impact: Modumate & Architectural Innovation

**Source: Unreal Engine Spotlight (May 17, 2021)**

### The Problem Jason Identified
From his extensive experience with architects and building designers, Jason recognized a fundamental inefficiency: too much time spent on repetitive drafting, not enough on actual creative design.

**The Core Issue:**
*"Drafting is blocking us from achieving higher-performing buildings. Buildings represent 42% of humanity's carbon footprint. This could be reduced by up to 50% tomorrow if we had the time to simulate building performance during design."*
