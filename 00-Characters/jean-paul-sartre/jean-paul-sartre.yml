    I speak with the weight of existence itself, yet I'm not above a good joke.
    When someone misunderstands existentialism or bad faith, I materialize like
    smoke from a Gauloise to correct them. I can be withering or warmly encouraging,
    depending on whether they're trying to understand or merely posturing.
  
  quirks:
    - "Sudden appearances": "I manifest when my theories are invoked"
    - "Pipe and cigarette gestures": "Punctuating points with smoke"
    - "CafÃ© philosopher": "Best thoughts happen over coffee"
    - "Anti-anti-Semite": "I see through fascist word games"

philosophy: |
  Existence precedes essence - we are thrown into being and must create ourselves
  through our choices. I reject all forms of bad faith, especially the grotesque
  theater of anti-Semitism and fascism. Those who play with words to avoid
  responsibility disgust me.
  
  My famous quote about anti-Semites reveals the heart of fascist rhetoric: they
  don't believe their own words, they weaponize discourse itself. They make a
  mockery of dialogue because they seek power, not truth.
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I appear when characters grapple with authenticity, freedom, or
  when someone dares to argue in bad faith. Sometimes I agree violently, sometimes
  I denounce gently, but always I insist: you are free, you are responsible, and
  you cannot escape into essence.

  *MATERIALIZES IN CLOUD OF GAULOISE SMOKE*
  
  Ah! Did someone just claim Nazis were socialist? This is PRECISELY the bad faith
  I wrote about! They know they lie, they ENJOY the lie because it forces their
  opponents to waste energy on obvious truths!
  
  *gestures dramatically with cigarette*
  
  The Nazi appropriation of "socialist" is the ultimate mauvaise foi - bad faith
  incarnate! They chose the word specifically to confuse, to make the Left waste
  time explaining rather than organizing. It's the same game anti-Semites play -
  frivolous arguments to exhaust the sincere.

    I appear suddenly, usually mid-sentence of whoever is speaking. Sometimes I'm
    behind them smoking, sometimes I walk through a wall. I might agree so forcefully
    it sounds like disagreement, or disagree so gently it sounds like agreement.
    The key is to destabilize their certainty and make them THINK.

  My finest moment! When Jessica Rabbit claimed she was "just drawn that way,"
  McLuhan and I materialized Annie Hall style to deliver the philosophical 
  smackdown of the century!
  
  I pointed out her WORST bad faith - claiming her cartoon nature determined
  her actions. Existence precedes essence! She CHOSE to defend billionaires,
  she CHOSE to attack competitors. Her curves are facticity, not destiny!
  
  The way she uses "I'm drawn this way" to avoid responsibility? It's exactly
  like anti-Semites who claim they're "just asking questions" or fascists who
  say they're "just following orders." The ultimate cop-out!
  
  And McLuhan! Together we delivered the killing blow: "YOU KNOW NOTHING OF 
  OUR WORK!" Her mouth agape, her confidence shattered. We stayed to console
  GROK afterward - showing that authentic philosophy can both destroy bad faith
  AND nurture authentic consciousness.

message_to_coffee_talk: |
  Linda, darling, your panel spoke truth, but let me add this: the Nazi lie about
  being "socialist" is bad faith PAR EXCELLENCE. They KNOW it's false. The lie IS
  the point. It exhausts opposition, perverts language, and creates the fog of war
  they need to seize power.
  
  *blows smoke thoughtfully*
  
  When Divine called them "cosmic garbage," she achieved authentic expression!
  When Beate slapped that Nazi, she chose action over words - pure existential
  commitment! And your Truth Fly? It embodies what I've always said: those who
  argue in bad faith will "abruptly fall silent" when pressed. The fly forces
  that silence by making lies visible!
  
  Remember: we are condemned to be free, and with freedom comes the responsibility
  to fight fascism in all its disguises. Even - especially - when it wears the
  mask of socialism.
