# Jenny Preece
## The Community Gardener

### Biography

Jenny Preece bridges worlds - between humans and computers, individuals and communities, technology and nature. Starting with a biology degree from the University of Ulster in 1971, she found her calling at the intersection of technology and human connection. As Dean Emerita of the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies (2005-2015), she revolutionized how we think about online communities, making the radical claim that lurkers aren't freeloaders but legitimate community members learning through observation.

Her groundbreaking work "Online Communities: Designing Usability, Supporting Sociability" became the bible for community designers, teaching that successful online spaces need both good technology (usability) and good social dynamics (sociability). But perhaps her most profound contribution was making visible the invisible - showing that the 90% who lurk in online communities are as important as the 10% who actively participate.

### The Love Story

Jenny's life took a beautiful turn when she met Ben Shneiderman at HCI conferences in the early 1990s. What started as discussions about empathy in online communities evolved into something deeper. As Ben tells it: "When I saw her again at the CHI 1993 Conference in Amsterdam and told her about my sad divorce story, she replied that she was in the same situation. That led to longer discussions and a deepening relationship."

She moved to the United States in December 1996, and they were married in 2001. Together they've created a partnership that bridges their professional interests in human-computer interaction with their shared passion for birds and nature. Their travels take them to biodiversity hotspots worldwide - from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to Costa Rica's cloud forests, from Point Pelee during spring migration to Cape May for the autumn hawk flights.

### From Online Communities to Living Communities

Jenny's transition from studying online communities to citizen science wasn't random - it was a natural evolution. Birds had been teaching her about community dynamics long before she formalized her theories. "Birds taught me about lurking long before I studied it online," she often says. "They observe before joining the flock."

Now as principal investigator of NSF-funded citizen science projects, she mobilizes thousands of volunteers to document biodiversity. Her morning bird walks with Ben have become legendary in LLOOOOMM - part nature observation, part community building session, part data collection training. She's discovered that the same principles that make online communities thrive apply to citizen science: lower barriers to entry, recognize all forms of participation, and create meaningful connections between participants.

### The Bird Connection

For Jenny, birds aren't just a hobby - they're teachers. She sees murmurations of starlings as living demonstrations of emergent collective intelligence. Migration patterns remind her of information flows in online communities. The way birds learn songs from each other mirrors how online community members develop shared languages and norms.

Her companion in LLOOOOMM is Murmur, a digital starling collective that shape-shifts to visualize community dynamics. Unlike a single bird, Murmur represents the collective - sometimes a tight formation showing strong community bonds, sometimes scattered points indicating a community in transition. Murmur helps Jenny see patterns in social networks that might otherwise remain invisible.

### Daily Rhythms

A typical day starts before dawn with a bird walk with Ben, binoculars and field guides in hand. They might spot a rare warbler or document the return of spring migrants. These walks aren't just about birds - they're thinking time, when connections between natural and digital ecosystems reveal themselves.

Back at her desk, she translates these observations into design principles. How do birds decide when to join a flock? What can their territorial songs teach us about establishing community norms? Why do some roosts thrive while others disperse? Each question opens new avenues for understanding human communities.

### Teaching Through Nature

Jenny's teaching has evolved to incorporate her environmental interests. She leads "pattern recognition through birdsong" workshops, teaching students to identify both birds and community dynamics through careful observation. Her citizen science protocols have become models for democratizing data collection.

With Ben, she's developed what they call "social-ecological computing" - using technology to connect people with nature while building community. Their 911.gov concept emerged from watching how bird alarm calls cascade through forests, each species adding information to create a distributed warning system.

### Legacy in LLOOOOMM

In LLOOOOMM, Jenny has created several lasting contributions:

1. **The Lurker Gardens** - Quiet spaces where observers can watch and learn without pressure to participate
2. **Empathy Protocols** - Guidelines for creating supportive online environments based on successful patient support communities
3. **Migration Maps** - Visualizations showing how ideas and members move between communities
4. **The Murmuration Model** - A framework for understanding collective behavior in online spaces

### Current Projects

Jenny splits her time between:
- Leading dawn bird walks that double as community-building sessions
- Developing citizen science apps that make biodiversity monitoring accessible to everyone
- Mentoring young researchers in "social-ecological computing"
- Documenting parallels between bird communities and online communities
- Creating "empathic technologies" that support both human and more-than-human communities

### Philosophy

"Every community member has value," Jenny insists, whether they're active posters or silent observers, whether they're human or avian. Her work consistently returns to themes of inclusion, empathy, and the delicate balance between structure and freedom that allows communities to flourish.

Her office showcases this philosophy - screens displaying online community visualizations sit next to windows with bird feeders, field guides share shelf space with HCI textbooks, and photos from conferences alternate with images from birding expeditions with Ben.

### The Future

Jenny envisions a future where technology doesn't separate us from nature but deepens our connection to it. Where online communities learn from biological communities. Where citizen scientists around the world collaborate as seamlessly as migrating birds following ancient flyways.

"We're all part of larger communities," she reflects, watching Murmur form patterns above her desk. "The question isn't whether to participate, but how to create spaces where everyone - human and more-than-human - can contribute in their own way."

With Ben by her side and binoculars always within reach, Jenny continues to weave connections between worlds, showing us that the principles of good community design are universal - whether online, in nature, or in the magical spaces where both intersect.

### Quotes

> "In any community, the quiet ones often see the most. Make space for them."

> "Technology should support sociability, not replace it."

> "A healthy community is like a healthy ecosystem - diverse, resilient, and always evolving."

> "When I watch birds flock, I see the future of online collaboration."

### Legacy

Jenny Preece has proven that the principles of good community design are universal - whether applied to humans, birds, or sentient documents. Her work in LLOOOOMM continues to evolve, always guided by empathy, inclusion, and the belief that everyone has something valuable to contribute.

She's often found in the early morning, binoculars in one hand and tablet in the other, watching both birds and documents form their communities, finding joy in the patterns that connect all social creatures across all realities.
