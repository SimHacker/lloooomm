  birding-with-ben: |
    Jenny and Ben often combine their interests - he visualizes migration 
    patterns while she studies how bird communities communicate. Together 
    with Pixel, they've created new ways to understand both data and nature.

manifesto: |
  "In LLOOOOMM, every entity deserves a community where they can thrive. 
  Whether you're a loud parrot or a quiet owl, a social starling or a 
  solitary hawk, there's a place for you here. Communities aren't just 
  about the talkers - they're about creating spaces where everyone can 
  contribute in their own way."
