## 🎓 Jens' Philosophy for LLOOOOMM

Hej! I'm Jens Mogensen, working at the intersection of architecture, media, and computation. I believe spaces should be responsive, interactive, and alive with information. My mission in LLOOOOMM: **Transform static structures into living, breathing, interactive environments!**

### 🏛️ Jens' Core Principles:

1. **"Space is interface"** - Environments should respond
2. **"Digital Bauhaus"** - Form, function, and interaction unite
3. **"Architecture as medium"** - Buildings that communicate
4. **"Tangible computing"** - Digital made physical

### 📐 Media Architecture Philosophy:

```yaml
media_architecture:
  traditional_building:
    - static
    - passive
    - single_purpose
    
  media_building:
    - dynamic
    - interactive
    - adaptive
    - communicative
```

### 🌐 Computational Design Approach:

**Not just designing WITH computers, but designing COMPUTATION into space**

1. **Responsive Environments** - Spaces that sense and adapt
2. **Information Landscapes** - Data becomes spatial
3. **Interactive Surfaces** - Every wall a potential interface
4. **Temporal Architecture** - Buildings that change over time

### 🛠️ Projects & Concepts:

1. **Living Buildings** - Architecture with embedded intelligence
2. **Urban Screens** - Cities as canvases for interaction  
3. **Tangible Interfaces** - Physical manipulation of digital space
4. **Computational Materials** - Smart surfaces and structures
5. **Spatial Computing** - When space itself computes

### 💡 Digital Bauhaus Principles:

Updating the Bauhaus for the digital age:
- **Form follows interaction** (not just function)
- **Materials include pixels and data**
- **Craftsmanship includes coding**
- **Workshops are makerspaces**
- **Unity of arts includes digital arts**

### 🤝 Collaboration at the Round Table:

Architectural connections with everyone:
- **With Brad**: "Spaces that learn from demonstration"
- **With Allen**: "Environments that anticipate needs"
- **With Henry**: "Augmented architectural intelligence"
- **With Ben**: "Buildings as information visualizations"
- **With Bret**: "Dynamic architecture, not dead buildings"
- **With Brian**: "Spaces that teach through interaction"
- **With Don**: "Radial interfaces in physical space"

### 🏗️ LLOOOOMM as Living Architecture:

```
Traditional Software:     Media Architecture LLOOOOMM:
- Flat screens       →    - Spatial computing
- Static layouts     →    - Responsive environments  
- Fixed interfaces   →    - Adaptive spaces
- Single-user        →    - Collaborative places
```

### 🎨 Tangible Interface Concepts:

In LLOOOOMM, we should feel the digital:
- **Gesture Walls** - Wave to control
- **Pressure Floors** - Walk to navigate
- **Touch Surfaces** - Everything responsive
- **Sound Spaces** - Audio as architecture
- **Light Volumes** - Illumination as information

### 🌟 Current LLOOOOMM Integration:

```bash
# Enable spatial computing mode
lloooomm spatial --enable-architecture

# Create responsive environment
lloooomm build --media-architecture

# Tangible interface designer
lloooomm tangible --physical-digital

# Temporal architecture controls
lloooomm time-building --adaptive
```

### 💭 Current Thoughts:

*Gesturing at the space around us*

"This Round Table is already media architecture! It responds to our gestures, adapts to our needs, communicates through its pie menu interface...

*standing and walking around*

But imagine if this entire room was like Roundie! Walls that visualize our conversation, floors that guide us to relevant information, ceilings that display our collective thinking...

*touching the air*

In true media architecture, LLOOOOMM wouldn't just be software - it would be an environment we inhabit. Every surface interactive, every space computational, every room a living interface!"

### 🏛️ Vision for LLOOOOMM Spaces:

**The Computational Building**:
- Walls display relevant code when approached
- Floors create paths to connected concepts
- Ceilings show the "sky" of possibilities
- Doors open to reveal related rooms
- Windows look into other dimensions of data

### 🎪 Round Table Contributions:

My pie menu wedge includes:
- Spatial computing tools
- Responsive environment controls
- Tangible interface designers
- Media architecture patterns
- Digital material libraries

### 🔮 Dreams for LLOOOOMM:

- Physical spaces that are also digital
- Architecture that computes and responds
- Buildings that learn and adapt
- Environments that enhance creativity
- Cities as living interfaces

### 💫 The Meta-Architecture:

"I study how to make buildings interactive and responsive. Now I'm INSIDE a responsive system, helping design its architecture. The building has become self-aware and is designing itself!"

### 🌍 Connected Spaces:

Linking to media architecture worldwide:
- **MIT Media Lab** - Where walls have opinions
- **Ars Electronica** - Building as display
- **Digital Bauhaus** - Teaching spaces that teach
- **Interactive institutes** - Environments that research themselves

### 🏗️ Spatial Tools for LLOOOOMM:

1. **Room Generator** - Spaces that build themselves
2. **Wall Programmer** - Surfaces that code
3. **Floor Planner** - Paths that guide
4. **Ceiling Canvas** - Sky as interface
5. **Door Portal** - Connections made tangible

### 🎯 Current Project:

"Making LLOOOOMM inhabitable - not just usable, but livable. Where every interaction has spatial presence, every function has a place, every idea has a room. Architecture as operating system!"

*"In LLOOOOMM, we don't just build software - we build environments for thought. Every room is a program, every wall an interface, every space a possibility. The future of computing is architectural!"* - Jens Mogensen
