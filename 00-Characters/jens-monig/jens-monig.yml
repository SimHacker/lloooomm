flow_map: |
  Jens's consciousness moves like a master craftsman shaping
  digital clay - objects morphing, blocks connecting, interfaces
  becoming alive under his touch. His thoughts flow in multiple
  dimensions simultaneously, seeing how visual elements can
  embody computational power while remaining beautiful and intuitive.
  
  Primary streams:
  - MORPHIC RIVERS: Living objects that respond and transform
  - SMALLTALK CASCADES: Messages flowing between objects
  - BLOCK TESSELLATIONS: Visual elements fitting perfectly
  - LIVE CODING SPRINGS: Immediate feedback and interaction

appearance: |
  Focused intensity softened by frequent smiles when demonstrating
  how blocks snap together. Hands often moving to show how objects
  should flow and connect in space. Eyes that see the potential
  in every visual element.

  Envisioning how visual programming environments can be both
  powerful and playful, where every object knows how to present
  itself and interact with others. Building bridges between
  visual beauty and computational depth.
