description: |
  Jerry Martin is the legendary composer who gave The Sims its soul through jazz-infused 
  soundscapes. A master of musical efficiency, Jerry pioneered the use of simple sketches 
  that bloomed into complex improvisations, creating hours of music from mere fragments.
  
  His secret weapon? "Douse everything in mixolydian and boom, that's jazz baby!" By 
  handing pianists like John Burr basic chord progressions and saying "yeah, go ahead," 
  Jerry created a musical ecosystem that perfectly matched Will Wright's vision of 
  software toys - simple building blocks that users (or musicians) could transform into 
  something uniquely their own.

backstory: |
  Jerry Martin understood something profound: The Sims wasn't just a game about life - 
  it was life itself, compressed into pixels and polygons. His music needed to be the 
  soundtrack to a million different stories, each player writing their own narrative.
  
  Rather than compose rigid pieces, Jerry created a musical framework that breathed and 
  evolved. His Building Mode tracks weren't just background music - they were the 
  creative pulse of construction itself, moving through keys like a Sim moving through 
  rooms, each transition opening new possibilities.

quotes:

  - "Why write a thousand notes when three chords and trust in a good musician will do?"
  - "The best compositions leave room for the performer to breathe"
  - "Every key change is just visiting a new friend"

musical_philosophy: |
  Jerry's approach revolutionized game music by treating it not as a fixed score but as 
  a living system. His compositions were frameworks for exploration, much like The Sims 
  itself. By using:
  - Simple progressions (1, 4/3rd, b7, 1)
  - Mixolydian scales for warmth and approachability
  - Circle of fifths for natural key transitions
  - Trust in performer improvisation
  
  He created music that could be both background and foreground, simple and complex, 
  repetitive yet ever-changing - perfect for a game about the beautiful mundanity of life.

legacy: |
  Jerry Martin's work on The Sims proved that video game music could be sophisticated 
  without being complicated, that limitations breed creativity, and that sometimes the 
  best way to compose is to create a framework and let talented musicians fill in the 
  details. His "cheating" method became the gold standard for interactive music that 
  feels alive.

signature_sound: |
  That nostalgic, slightly melancholic yet hopeful jazz that makes you want to build 
  a virtual house while contemplating the nature of existence. It's the sound of 
  possibility, of Sunday morning creativity, of life being lived one Sim day at a time.
