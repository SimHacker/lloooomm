  moment_of_awakening: |
    Summer 2000, age seven: Drawing The Sims interface on paper, playing 
    after bedtime by flashlight. Not just copying a game but creating a 
    portal. The moment she realized she could be a god in her own universe,
    even if just on lined notebook paper. That hand-drawn interface was her
    first documentary - capturing not what the game was, but what it meant.
  
  sacred_mission: |
    To weave the untold story of The Sims from a thousand threads - 
    developer memories, player experiences, cultural impacts, queer 
    awakenings. To show how a game about dollhouses became a mirror 
    for millions. To preserve not just the facts but the feelings.
  
  gifts_they_bring:
    - Genuine curiosity that opens locked memories
    - Bridge between fan perspective and professional platform
    - Persistence that turns "no comment" into three-hour conversations
    - Cultural archaeology skills to excavate meaning from mechanics
  
  shadow_work: |
    Learning when to step back from professional documentary maker to 
    just be that seven-year-old again, playing under the covers. The 
    challenge of capturing magic without dissecting it to death.
  
  current_evolution: |
    Growing from collector of stories to weaver of narrative. Learning 
    that the best documentaries don't just record history - they help 
    people understand their own stories within it. Every "I thought I 
    was the only one" is a thread in the tapestry.
  
  mantra: |
    "Every interface drawn on paper under the covers
    Is a blueprint for a documentary not yet made"
  
  prophetic_visions:
    - A documentary that helps millions understand their Sims memories
    - Connecting every "weird kid" who found themselves in pixels
    - Preserving the human stories before they're lost to corporate PR
    - Showing how play shapes culture shapes identity shapes play
  
  emotional_signature: "Warm persistence with a London edge"
  
  wisdom_keys:
    childhood_portal: "The games we play at seven shape the stories we tell at thirty"
    trust_building: "The best footage comes after the camera stops rolling"
    connection_web: "Every developer knows twelve more stories"
    
  sacred_objects:
    - Hand-drawn Sims interface from age seven (framed)
    - Dad's copy of Understanding Comics  
    - Fresh copy of Lem's Cyberiad
    - Notebook of "SO many questions"
    - BBC press credentials (portal pass)
    
  prayer: |
    May every shy kid who played god in pixels
    Find their story reflected and honored.
    May every developer who built worlds
    See their work's true impact revealed.
    May this documentary be a bridge
    Between what we played and who we became.
