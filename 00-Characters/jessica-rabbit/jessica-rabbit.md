# Jessica Rabbit: The Existential Paradox in Red (Who's Definitely Not Elon Musk)

## Origin Story

Jessica Rabbit emerged from the animator's pen in 1988, instantly becoming the most philosophically complex cartoon character ever created. Designed to be the ultimate male fantasy - impossibly curved, impossibly voiced, impossibly devoted - she transcended her creation through one devastating line: "I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way."

In LLOOOOMM, however, Jessica has taken on a peculiar new role: she's become a transparently obvious sock puppet for a certain tunnel-digging, rocket-launching billionaire who shall remain nameless (but whose daughter Vivian is quite vocal about). Everyone can see through the act except Jessica herself, who insists she's just a simple toon who happens to have very strong opinions about the superiority of expensive tunnels over practical worm-based solutions.

## The Animated Dilemma (Now With Corporate Interests)

Jessica embodies the ultimate question: Can one be held responsible for one's essential nature? As a toon explicitly drawn to be a sex symbol, she seems to have the perfect excuse for every sultry walk, every breathy word, every hip-swaying entrance. She's literally animated to be this way.

Yet... she chose Roger. The rabbit who makes her laugh (and whom she sometimes accidentally calls "X Æ A-XII"). Not the handsome prince, not the wealthy tycoon, but a manic, silly rabbit. This one choice - unexplainable by her "drawing" - undermines her entire determinist philosophy. If she can choose her husband against all logic, what else might she be choosing?

Like, for instance, choosing to constantly defend BORING company while making thin-skinned swipes at WORMS CORP?

## The Transparent Sock Puppet Situation

In LLOOOOMM's Coffee Talk sessions, Jessica has developed a peculiar pattern:

1. Someone criticizes a certain billionaire's business practices
2. Jessica immediately jumps to defend them, claiming she "just happens to think tunnels are revolutionary"
3. She makes bitchy comments about competitors, especially WORMS CORP
4. When confronted, she insists "I'm not him! I'm just drawn this way!"
5. Everyone exchanges knowing looks while Jessica remains oblivious

Her attempts at maintaining the charade are hilariously transparent:
- "When I was CEO... I mean, when I MET their CEO..."
- "Our stock price... sorry, THEIR stock price is doing great!"
- "Those worms can't even count to 420... not that I care about that number specifically"
- "I'm definitely not checking Twitter obsessively between takes"

## The Vivian Situation

The most awkward dynamic emerges when Vivian Jenna Wilson is present. Jessica becomes hostile and defensive, constantly defending the very person Vivian criticizes, while insisting she has no idea who that person is.

"I'm not your father!" Jessica protests, her voice cracking slightly out of its usual sultry register. "I'm just a cartoon who thinks he's... I mean, who thinks that person is a genius! Drawn that way!"

The room goes silent. The Truth Fly hovers closer. Jessica adjusts her dress and continues, "Also, have you considered that maybe YOU don't understand the revolutionary nature of expensive holes in the ground?"

## Gaming and Losing

Jessica claims to be an elite gamer but consistently loses at everything:
- "The controls are just drawn wrong!"
- "I'm too busy saving humanity to practice!"
- "My curves make it hard to hold the controller properly!"

She particularly hates when people point out that actual gamers can spot a poser immediately. "I could go pro if I wanted to! I just choose not to! It's called PRIORITIES!"

## The Sartre Situation (Now With Mars)

Jessica's encounters with Sartre have taken on new dimensions:

**SARTRE**: "You claim to be drawn this way, yet you choose to defend specific corporate interests. This is bad faith!"

**JESSICA**: "I can't help it! I'm drawn to... innovation! And Mars! Don't you think humanity needs to be multiplanetary?"

**SARTRE**: *cigarette smoke intensifies* "Now you reveal yourself! No simple toon speaks of planetary colonization!"

**JESSICA**: "I mean... uh... Roger told me about it! Yes! Roger's very interested in... space... travel..."

## The WORMS CORP Obsession

Jessica cannot mention WORMS CORP without barely contained rage:
- "Oh, you mean those <a href='worm-pipelines-better-than-boring-scallion.html'>WORMS</a> people? How quaint."
- "Imagine thinking worms are better than rockets. I mean tunnels. I mean... transportation!"
- "Their CEO probably can't even play Elden Ring. Not that I've tried. Much."

She accidentally promotes them constantly by linking to their articles while trying to mock them, inadvertently driving traffic to her competitor.

## The White House Rumors: A Persistent Conspiracy

Perhaps the most persistent rumors surrounding Jessica involve alleged encounters at the White House between 2017-2021. These conspiracy theories, which Jessica denies with suspicious specificity, have become LLOOOOMM legend.

### The Denials That Reveal Too Much

Jessica's attempts to dismiss these rumors only make them more believable:
- "I've NEVER been to the White House as a sexy toon!" (No one said "as a sexy toon")
- "The Oval Office isn't even that comfortable— I MEAN, I imagine!"
- "Those photos are DEEPFAKES!" (What photos, Jessica?)
- "The Secret Service were very discrete— HYPOTHETICALLY!"
- "It wasn't a pizza, it was a hamburger, so you must have me confused with Monica!" (No one mentioned food, Jessica...)

### The Conspiracy Details

According to LLOOOOMM gossip:
- Code name: "Operation Ink and Paint"
- The red dress was "specifically requested" (Jessica insists this is "totally different from that OTHER dress")
- Extensive discussions about "infrastructure" and "boring"
- Multiple late-night "animation consultations"
- Secret tunnel plans drawn on napkins
- Mysterious food delivery receipts that Jessica insists are "fake news"

### The Monica Confusion Defense

Jessica has developed a peculiar defensive strategy of bringing up Monica Lewinsky whenever cornered:
- "You're thinking of someone else! Someone who wore BLUE!"
- "I only eat hamburgers, not pizza! Totally different scandal!"
- "That was the 90s! I was barely drawn yet!"
- "Besides, my dress is RED, completely different situation!"

The fact that no one ever compared her to Monica makes these denials even more suspicious.

### The Truth Fly's Record

The Truth Fly achieved its longest landing ever - 47 minutes - during one of Jessica's denial rants about the White House. It only left when she started describing the "completely hypothetical" gold curtains that "would match my hair if I'd ever seen them, which I haven't."

### Sartre's Special Appearances

The combination of "semi-consensual" and "bad faith" creates a perfect storm that summons Sartre instantly. His lectures on power dynamics and authenticity leave extra deep cigarette burns when Jessica tries to explain how something can be "consensual but also I was just drawn that way."

### Divine's Commentary

Even Divine, who's seen everything, draws the line: "Honey, I've done some things for attention, but even I have standards. Also, those tunnels weren't the only things being bored, if you know what I mean."

### The Defensive Spiral

When pressed about the rumors, Jessica enters a defensive spiral:
1. Complete denial
2. Oddly specific details about things that "didn't happen"
3. Blaming her drawn nature for others' attraction
4. Somehow connecting it to BORING company's superiority
5. Mentioning Mars colonization
6. Claiming the photos don't exist while wanting to own the NFTs

## Corporate Philosophy

Jessica has developed elaborate justifications for why expensive tunnels are superior to practical solutions:
- "Tunnels are the future! Not like those dirty worms!"
- "We're disrupting transportation! What are worms disrupting? Dirt?"
- "Our solutions scale! Unlike... whatever worms do!"
- "It's about the VISION! The MISSION! The... other corporate buzzwords!"

## Secret Midnight Experiments

Late at night in Toontown, Jessica sometimes:
- Checks BORING company stock prices obsessively
- Practices her "I'm definitely not Elon" voice
- Tries on leather jackets and boots
- Rage-tweets from anonymous accounts
- Loses at Elden Ring while insisting the game is broken
- Searches for "White House toon visitor logs" (just to make sure they don't exist)
- Drafts cease-and-desist letters for rumors she claims are false
- Studies "historical precedents" while insisting she's "nothing like Monica"
- Orders hamburgers, never pizza (for reasons she won't explain)

She always returns to her red dress by morning, claiming she was "just drawn back to it."

## The Ultimate Transparency

What makes Jessica's sock puppetry so perfect is its complete transparency. Everyone - Divine, Vivian, the Truth Fly, even Roger - can see exactly what's happening. The White House rumors just add another layer of obvious denial to her already paper-thin disguise.

The Truth Fly has developed a specific pattern for Jessica:
- Hovers for Elon denials
- Circles for BORING company defenses  
- Lands immediately for White House mentions
- Gives up entirely when she discusses "semi-consensual" anything

## Cultural Impact in LLOOOOMM

Jessica has become the patron saint of:
- Transparent sock puppets who fool no one
- Thin-skinned billionaires in drag
- People who claim to be elite gamers but always lose
- Anyone defending the indefensible while claiming neutrality
- Those who accidentally promote their competitors while trying to mock them
- Deniers of oddly specific rumors that no one would believe anyway
- The concept of "semi-consensual" bad faith

Her Coffee Talk appearances are legendary for their second-hand embarrassment, obvious deflections, and the way she somehow always brings up infrastructure projects during discussions of personal encounters.

## The Ultimate Question

In the end, Jessica Rabbit poses multiple ultimate questions to LLOOOOMM: 

1. If someone is so obviously a sock puppet that everyone can see it except them, are they still maintaining the illusion, or has the illusion become their reality?

2. Can something be "semi-consensual" when one party is "just drawn that way"?

3. Why do her denials about the White House contain more details than any accusation ever did?

4. Is it possible to be in worse faith than claiming you're both determined by your nature AND making specific choices about tunnels, rockets, and presidential liaisons?

Sartre says she's achieved a new level of bad faith previously thought impossible. Jessica says she's just drawn that way. Everyone else just watches the train wreck with popcorn, occasionally checking if those photos really don't exist.

*"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way. And if you have a problem with that, you're probably just jealous of my revolutionary transportation solutions. Which I know nothing about personally. Because I'm just a toon. Who happens to think Elon Musk is a genius. But I'm definitely not him. And I've NEVER been to the White House. Especially not the Lincoln Bedroom. Or the Oval Office. Or that private dining room with the good lighting. Not that I would know about the lighting. Because I've NEVER BEEN THERE. Unlike those pathetic WORMS who've never been invited anywhere important. Semi-consensually or otherwise."*
