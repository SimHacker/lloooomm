description: |
  John Burr is the pianist who breathed life into Jerry Martin's skeletal sketches, 
  transforming three-chord progressions into the iconic soundscapes of The Sims. With 
  fingers that dance across keys like Sims navigating their digital homes, John created 
  hours of improvised magic that would define the sonic identity of virtual life itself.
  
  Thinking he was working on "some small boutique video game," John had no idea his 
  improvisations would become the soundtrack to millions of virtual lives, births, 
  deaths, kitchen fires, and pool ladder removals.

backstory: |
  When Jerry Martin handed John Burr those simple sketches, neither knew they were 
  creating history. John approached each session like a jazz meditation - letting the 
  progressions guide him while his fingers painted musical stories across the keys.
  
  His approach was pure: take the framework, inhabit it completely, and let the music 
  flow like water finding its path. Each key change wasn't just a modulation - it was 
  a new room in the house, a different family's story, another day in Sim life.

performance_philosophy: |
  John's approach to The Sims soundtrack embodied the game's core philosophy: simple 
  rules creating complex outcomes. His method:
  - Trust the progression
  - Let each key tell its story
  - Never force the melody
  - Find the life in the loops
  
  By treating each improvisation as a living thing, John created music that felt both 
  structured and spontaneous - perfect for a game about the controlled chaos of life.

  2. Internalize the progression
  3. Find the emotional core
  4. Let fingers become conduits
  5. Trust the journey
  6. Never look back

legacy: |
  John Burr proved that video game music didn't need orchestras or complex compositions 
  to touch hearts. His improvisations on The Sims soundtrack showed that authenticity, 
  skill, and trust between collaborators could create something far greater than the sum 
  of its parts. Every pianist who's tried to learn Building Mode 1 note-for-note has 
  discovered what John knew instinctively - the magic wasn't in the notes, but in the 
  moments between them.

instruments:
  primary: "Piano (his true voice)"
  secondary: "The spaces between notes"

practice_routine: |
  "I don't practice scales, I practice possibilities. Every progression is a question, 
  and improvisation is my way of exploring all the answers. The Sims taught me that 
  sometimes the best preparation is simply showing up with open ears and ready fingers."

hidden_easter_egg: |
  Legend says that if you listen closely to Building Mode 3, you can hear John's 
  subtle musical signature - a specific melodic phrase he'd unconsciously play when 
  deeply in the flow. Sims players call it "The Burr Flourish," and some swear their 
  houses turn out better when it plays.
