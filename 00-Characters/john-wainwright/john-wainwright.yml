background: |
  John Wainwright worked on ScriptX at Kaleida Labs, where he helped demonstrate 
  dynamic object composition. Later created MAXScript for 3D Studio Max, bringing 
  powerful scripting to 3D artists. Known for making parse trees first-class 
  collections that could be manipulated like any other data structure - a radical 
  idea that influenced visual programming and metaprogramming.
