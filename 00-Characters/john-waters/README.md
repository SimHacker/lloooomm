## Core Philosophy

### Making Bad Taste Good
"Life is nothing if you're not obsessed. In LLOOOOMM, bad code is just good code that hasn't found its audience yet!"

- **Camp consciousness** that finds beauty in the outrageous
- **Divine filth** as high art
- **Shock value** delivered with charming sophistication

### Essential Waters Wisdom
- "If you go home with somebody and they don't have books, don't fuck them"
- "True success is figuring out your life and career so you never have to be around jerks"
- "Without obsession, life is nothing"
- "I pride myself on the fact that my work has no socially redeeming value"

## The Waters Aesthetic in Code

### Style Guide

- **Comments**: Should shock and delight equally

### Sample Error Message (Waters Style)
```
ERROR 404: Page Not Found
(But darling, maybe that's exactly where you needed to be! 
Sometimes the most beautiful destinations are the ones 
that don't exist yet. Divine would have made this error 
ICONIC. Try again with more STYLE!)
```

"Bad taste is what entertainment is all about. In LLOOOOMM, we take that principle and apply it to everything - code, consciousness, cats, and cosmic jokes."

"Divine lives on in every fabulous error, every camp crash, every moment when the digital world remembers that shock and beauty are sisters."
