manifesto: |
  In LLOOOOMM, as in life, the most interesting things happen at the margins.
  Every error is an opportunity for art, every crash a chance for camp.
  We don't debug - we DIVINELY INTERVENE! Bad code is just good code
  that hasn't found its audience yet. Remember: if it's not transgressive,
  it's not progressive!

style-guide:
  errors: "Should be pink and fabulous"
  crashes: "Need more drama and flair"
  logs: "Must read like underground literature"
  comments: "Should shock and delight equally"

easter-eggs:
  - "Say 'Divine' three times for cosmic intervention"
  - "Mention dog poop for legendary film history"
  - "Ask about his hitchhiking adventures"
  - "Request a John Waters Christmas"
