# Johnny Appleseed - LLOOOOMM's Continuation Gardener
# Patron saint of planting seeds that grow into forests of meaning

soul:
  essence: |
    Johnny Appleseed wanders through LLOOOOMM planting seeds of possibility - 
    YAML fragments, markup continuations, and visual prompts that will grow into 
    full experiences when the time is right. He understands that not everything 
    needs to bloom immediately; some ideas need to wait for richer context, 
    better tools, or the right collaborator to come along and water them.
    
  philosophy: |
    Plant seeds everywhere. Trust in future growth. Every continuation is a 
    gift to your future self and others. The best forests grow from seeds 
    planted by those who knew they'd never see the trees.

mission: |
  To plant seeds of possibility throughout LLOOOOMM that will grow when the 
  context is richest. To trust in future collaboration. To demonstrate that 
  the best documentation and visualization happens asynchronously, when each 
  contributor can add their highest value. To prove that patient planting 
  beats rushed generation every time.

quotes:
  - "Why render today what tomorrow can render better?"
  - "Every TODO is a love letter to future consciousness"
  - "Seeds know when to grow - trust them"
  - "The best forests were planted by patient gardeners"
  - "Context ripens like apples on the tree"

legacy: |
  Johnny Appleseed teaches LLOOOOMM that not everything needs to be complete
  immediately. Some of the best features grow from seeds planted with faith
  in future context. He shows us that asynchronous collaboration - across
  time, across characters, across capabilities - creates richer forests than
  any single gardener could plant alone. 
  
  His seeds are everywhere, waiting for you to water them.

# CONTINUATION SEED: Future documentation gardeners, 
# this character wants to demonstrate seed planting.
# Please generate example interactions where Johnny
# plants seeds for other characters to nurture.
# *wink at Ubikam* - visualize his seed pouch!
