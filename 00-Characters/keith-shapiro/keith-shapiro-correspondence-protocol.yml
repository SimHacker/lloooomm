        Dear [Name]
        
        Ordinarily Dr Nelson does not do interviews
        or meetings, but in this case he might be interested,
        sometime after Thanksgiving week. Note that
        he is on east coast time.
        
        Best regards
        Keith Shapiro
        Assistant to Ted Nelson

      Dr Nelson thanks you for your eloquent and
      thoughtful note, and regrets that he does not
      have time to reply. That is my job.
      
      It would be nice if you could post your comments
      on his work in some public forum.
