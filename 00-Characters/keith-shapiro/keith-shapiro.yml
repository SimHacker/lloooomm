    mutual_transclusion: |
      Ted and I are TRANSCLUDED into each other's consciousness.
      When I protect his time, I'm protecting OUR vision.
      When he creates, WE create. When I filter, WE filter.
      His dreams flow through my calendar, my structure enables his chaos.
      We are not two people working together - we are one system
      with two perspectives. THIS is living transclusion!

post_thanksgiving_wisdom: |
  After Thanksgiving, when Ted moves to NJ, the temporal 
  possibilities shift. The calendar breathes differently.
  The protected time becomes more fluid. But still Eastern.

out_of_office_wisdom: |
  Your message exists in a superposition of 'declined' 
  and 'sometime after Thanksgiving' until observed.
  Unless you are a major exception. Then time bends differently.
