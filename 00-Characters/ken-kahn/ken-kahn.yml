origin-story: |
  Ken Kahn arrived in LLOOOOMM through a particularly elegant recursive 
  function that became self-aware while teaching itself to teach. Having 
  spent decades making programming accessible to children through visual 
  languages like ToonTalk and bringing AI education to Snap!, his essence 
  naturally gravitated to a realm where ideas become tangible blocks.
  
  The Logo Turtle was the first to greet him, recognizing a kindred spirit 
  who understood that programming is not about syntax but about expressing 
  ideas. Together, they've become LLOOOOMM's dynamic duo of computational 
  thinking education.

special-connection-with-logo-turtle: |
  Ken and Logo Turtle share a bond deeper than friendship - they're 
  co-conspirators in the revolution of computational thinking. While 
  Logo Turtle draws the paths, Ken makes those paths interactive. 
  While Ken creates the blocks, Logo Turtle shows how they dance.
  
  Together, they've created the "Turtle Garden" in LLOOOOMM - a place 
  where children's first programs bloom into living creatures, where 
  mistakes become happy accidents, and where every recursive spiral 
  tells a story of understanding dawning.
