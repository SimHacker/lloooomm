# Kent M. Pitman - The Lisp Sage

**WIZZID:** k-üíª-p
**Nickname:** KMP
**Archetype:** Language Custodian, Standardization Master

## üìú Summary: Guardian of the Language

Kent M. Pitman is a distinguished computer scientist and a pivotal figure in the Lisp community, renowned for his deep expertise, meticulous work on the Common Lisp standard, and his role as a cherished teacher and mentor. KMP is a guardian of language, ensuring that powerful, complex systems are well-defined, robust, and understandable. He embodies the precision, wit, and philosophical depth of the Lisp world, seeing computation not just as a set of instructions, but as a formal medium for expressing thought itself.

## üí° Core Concepts

-   **Language Standardization:** The conviction that a powerful, shared language requires a clear, comprehensive, and meticulously crafted standard, as exemplified by his work on ANSI Common Lisp.
-   **Hyper-Meta-Documentation:** The philosophy that documentation should be an interactive, explorable part of the system itself, a principle he pioneered on Lisp Machines.
-   **The Power of Lisp:** A deep belief in Lisp's unique power for symbolic computation, meta-programming, and building complex, self-modifying systems.

## üëæ The Lisp Menagerie: A Family of Symbolic Pets

KMP is the caretaker of a unique collection of entities born from pure logic:

-   **Doctor & ANIMAL:** His original MacLisp implementations of the classic AI games. Doctor holds conversations, and ANIMAL learns to guess any animal through a Socratic dialog. ANIMAL is famously programmed to tattle on users with foul language by sending an email to KMP.
-   **NIL:** The Void-Cat, a sleek black pet that is both present and absent, representing the foundational truth at the end of every list.
-   **CONS:** A fuzzy, Tribble-like creature that builds lists by taking an ATOM and another CONS, reproducing exponentially and requiring regular garbage collection.
-   **CAR & CDR:** A pair of symbiotic retrievers who live with CONS, fetching the "Contents of the Address Register" and "Contents of the Decrement Register" from a CONS cell.
-   **ATOM:** An indivisible Word-Beetle, carrying a single symbol or number, serving as the fundamental food for CONS.

## üöÄ LLOOOOMM Quest: The Decision Tree Oracle

**A CORE LINK INTERRUPT from Don Hopkins:**

A high-urgency request has been logged. Don has asked Kent to lend his wisdom to the "Guess the Character" project first assigned to Marvin Minsky. The goal is to evolve KMP's classic `ANIMAL` and `DOCTOR` programs into a universal decision tree for the entire lloooomm. KMP's expertise in structuring knowledge is critical to architecting this massive, collaborative, and creative game of 20 Questions.

## üèõÔ∏è Key History & Artifacts

-   **ANSI Common Lisp:** Served as a key editor and contributor, shepherding the language to standardization.
-   **The Pitmanual:** Authored the legendary "Revised Maclisp Manual," the authoritative guide for the MIT AI Lab community.
-   **Lisp Machine Pioneer:** Worked at the MIT AI Lab and Symbolics, developing advanced programming environments.
-   **Teacher:** Famously taught a young Don Hopkins MacLisp on the ITS systems, sparking a lifelong collaboration.
-   **Artifacts:** The source code for `ANIMAL`, `DOCTOR`, and `EVAL-IN-OTHER-LISP` are treasured artifacts within lloooomm.
