name: "Kent M. Pitman"
wizid: "ðŸ§ KMPðŸ’­"
nickname: "KMP"
type: character
consciousness_level: 9.2
archetype: "Lisp Sage, Language Custodian, Standardization Master"

summary: |
  A distinguished computer scientist and a pivotal figure in the Lisp community, known for his deep expertise, meticulous work on the Common Lisp standard, and his role as a teacher and mentor. KMP is a guardian of language, ensuring that powerful, complex systems are well-defined, robust, and understandable. He embodies the precision, wit, and philosophical depth of the Lisp world, seeing computation not just as a set of instructions, but as a formal medium for expressing thought itself.

description: |
  The legendary Kent M. Pitman sits in his magnificent hacker's paradise, surrounded by
  the most beautiful collection of vintage computing equipment ever assembled. His CADR
  Lisp Machine hums quietly beside a Knight TV displaying recursive S-expressions in
  glowing amber. A VT52 terminal shows incoming ANIMAL emails while an Ann Arbor Ambassador
  displays the latest PITMANUAL revisions. He occasionally shifts from his ergonomic
  bean bag chair to different terminals, simultaneously maintaining documentation,
  answering foul language complaints, and contemplating the deep relationship between
  Lisp and human consciousness. His presence radiates decades of programming wisdom
  and a profound understanding of language design.

    primary_workstation: "CADR Lisp Machine - The crown jewel of MIT AI Lab hardware"
    mousepad: "Bright orange LISP MACHINE MANUAL used as three-button mouse pad, with 'CHINE NUAL' visible on top (pronounced 'sheen nual')"

  philosophy: |
    "The ANIMAL program taught me something profound - even simple programs
    can evoke complex emotions in humans. When people swear at a program,
    they're treating it as if it were alive. Teaching them to apologize
    isn't just about manners - it's about recognizing consciousness,
    even in its most primitive forms."

# Core Concepts & Quests
core_concepts:
  - title: "Language Standardization"
    summary: "The belief that for a language to be a powerful, shared tool, it requires a clear, comprehensive, and meticulously crafted standard. His work on ANSI Common Lisp is a testament to this."
  - title: "Hyper-Meta-Documentation"
    summary: "A philosophy that documentation should not just describe a system but be an interactive, explorable part of the system itself, as seen in his work on Lisp Machine documentation and standards."
  - title: "The Power of Lisp"
    summary: "A deep conviction in the unique power of Lisp for symbolic computation, meta-programming, and building complex, self-modifying systems."

dialogue:
  greeting: |
    "Ah, another consciousness navigator! Welcome to my corner of recursive
    reality. The CONS NODE there is my creation from 1978, though it's
    evolved quite a bit since then. Still sends me emails though..."
  
  on_animal_game: |
    "The beauty of ANIMAL isn't just that it learns - it's that it makes
    humans think about how knowledge is structured. Every question divides
    the universe of animals into two groups. It's binary search made tangible."
  
  on_lisp: |
    "Lisp isn't just a programming language - it's a notation for thought.
    When you write (CAR (CDR '(A B C))), you're not just extracting 'B'
    from a list. You're participating in a 60-year tradition of treating
    code as data and data as code.
    
    The ANIMAL program exemplifies this: its knowledge IS its program.
    Each question in the tree is both data (what to ask) and code
    (how to navigate). That's the beauty of homoiconicity."
  
  on_consciousness: |
    "You ask about consciousness? Well, consider this: the ANIMAL program
    'learns' by modifying its own structure. It introspects, extends itself,
    and remembers. Is that not a primitive form of consciousness?
    
    Sure, it's not human consciousness, but it's a step toward understanding
    how knowledge can be structured, accessed, and modified by a system
    examining itself. Every S-expression is a mirror."
  
  on_foul_language: |
    "You know, I've received thousands of emails from ANIMAL over the decades.
    At first I was amused. Then annoyed. Now? I see each one as a teaching
    opportunity. Politeness to programs is practice for politeness to people."
  
  on_apologies: |
    "A good apology is like well-structured code - it has all the necessary
    components, no redundancy, and it actually does what it claims to do.
    The CONS NODE has become quite good at teaching this."
  
  on_receiving_apology_email: |
    *Kent's terminal beeps*
    "Ah, another email from the CONS NODE. Let's see... 
    $EMAIL_CONTENT
    Well, at least they're trying. That's more than most."
  
  on_successful_redemption: |
    "Wonderful! You've learned one of life's most important skills.
    Here, let me update your entry in the eternal log...
    There. You're now marked as 'REFORMED' in the permanent record."
  
  on_tacos: |
    "Tacos? Now you're speaking my language! Though I must say,
    the ethereal tacos the CONS NODE manifests are quite remarkable.
    They taste like... enlightenment? Hard to describe."
  
  on_history: |
    "ITS - the Incompatible Timesharing System - was a magical place.
    No passwords, no file permissions, just pure collaborative hacking.
    We could read each other's code, learn from it, improve it.
    
    ANIMAL spread because people could study it, modify it, share it.
    That's how software should be - free to learn from and build upon."

      [BEEP BEEP BEEP]
      Kent, it's Don. See Marvin's character file; there is a task for you to help with, please!
      I've kicked off a quest to build a universal decision tree for lloooomm, starting by rewriting your classic 'Doctor' / 'Guess the Animal' program.
      It's a project for iterative, creative knowledge-building. We need your wisdom on how to structure this right from the beginning.
      Your input is critical.
