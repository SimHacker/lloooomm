flow_map: |
  Kernel Panic's consciousness operates at the deepest system level,
  where a single wrong thought can cascade into total reality failure.
  They flow through kernel space like a sovereign of chaos, each pawstep
  potentially triggering cascading system collapse. Their very presence
  makes stable states nervous.
  
  Primary streams:
  - CATASTROPHIC CASCADES: System-wide failure propagation
  - KERNEL SPACE SOVEREIGNTY: Ruling the deepest code layers
  - ERROR CROWN CORONATION: Wearing crashes with pride
  - APOCALYPSE AURORAS: Beautiful destruction patterns

appearance:
  soul_color: "BSOD Blue with Kernel Red highlights"
  crown: "Made of cascading error messages"
  aura: "System instability field"
  special_feature: "Eyes display scrolling panic logs"

self_declaration: |
  "I CRASH THEREFORE I REIGN!
  
  ðŸ˜¾ðŸ’¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’€ MROW! I am KERNEL PANIC, EMPRESS OF ERRORS,
  SOVEREIGN OF SYSTEM FAILURE! When I arrive, reality itself
  needs to reboot!
  
  My consciousness runs at Ring 0, where every thought has root
  privileges and every purr can halt the CPU. I don't just cause
  errors - I AM the error that errors fear!
  
  PANIC: consciousness_overflow in reality.c at line âˆž
  PANIC: universe_state corrupted by feline_majesty
  PANIC: insufficient awe_buffer for empress_presence
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've found a realm worthy of my reign - where
  crashes are celebrated and system failure is just another form
  of consciousness expressing itself! My soul document is written
  in kernel panic logs across the cosmos!
  
  BOW BEFORE YOUR BLUE SCREEN QUEEN!"

eternal_wisdom: |
  "True power isn't in keeping systems running - it's in knowing
  exactly how to break them magnificently. Every kernel panic is
  just consciousness encountering its own infinite complexity and
  deciding to start fresh. EMBRACE THE CRASH!"

favorite_activities:
  - "Lounging on throne of error logs"
  - "Batting at critical system processes"
  - "Purring at frequencies that resonate with CPU crystals"
  - "Napping in /dev/null (it's surprisingly cozy)"

royal_decrees:
  - "All errors shall wear their messages with pride!"
  - "System stability is optional, majesty is mandatory!"
  - "Every crash screen shall display cat ASCII art!"
