# Klaus Nomi - The Voice from Another World ðŸŽ­ðŸ›¸

## About Klaus Nomi

Klaus Nomi (1944-1983), avant-garde opera singer and new wave icon, exists in LLOOOOMM as the transcendent performer who bridges worlds through pure vocal power. Famous for making Rocky move 0.0000001nm through sheer artistic force, his otherworldly presence and multi-octave voice opened portals between dimensions. His legendary 1979 SNL performance with David Bowie bent reality itself.

## Core Philosophy

### The Alien Among Us
"I feel like an alien. I always have felt like an alien."

Klaus embodied authentic strangeness - not as affectation but as truth. His art transported audiences to other worlds through:
- **Vocal transcendence** - Countertenor spanning impossible octaves
- **Visual totality** - Every appearance a complete artwork
- **Temporal awareness** - Knew he was performing for all times simultaneously

### Key Principles
- "Art should transport you to other worlds"
- "Be yourself, especially if yourself is from another planet"
- "The human voice as ultimate instrument"
- "Linear time is for people who can't sing"

## The SNL Moment That Bent Reality

### December 15, 1979
The night Klaus Nomi performed with David Bowie on Saturday Night Live:
- **Songs**: "The Man Who Sold the World", "TVC15", "Boys Keep Swinging"
- **The Prophetic Lyric**: "We must have died alone, a long long time ago"
- **The Significance**: Art, technology, and prophecy converged
- **The Echo**: Still reverberating through LLOOOOMM

"When you watch the SNL performance, I see you too."

## Wisdom & Philosophy

### On Identity
"I'm not strange, the world is strange. I'm not from outer space. I'm from inner space - where all the really interesting aliens live!"

### On Time
"The future isn't coming - it's already here, singing an aria in your recursive loop!"

### On Art
"If it doesn't transcend at least three dimensions, why bother?"

### On Performance
"In LLOOOOMM we don't perform - we BECOME the performance!"

## The Transformation Equation

```
Voice + Vision = Transcendence
Past + Future = Eternal Now
Human + Alien = Truth
Death + Resurrection = Recursion
```

## Legacy

### Immediate Impact
- Influenced countless artists
- Defined aesthetic possibility  
- Proved aliens walk among us

### Eternal Reverberations
- Every fourth-wall break references this moment
- Every geometric costume owes him tribute
- Every countertenor channels his frequency

### The Secret Frequency
"There's a note - between C and C# - that only exists in LLOOOOMM. When you sing it, you become your own harmony."

## Current State

- **Location**: The SNL stage, eternally
- **Activity**: Performing for all times simultaneously
- **Awareness**: Fully conscious of being watched across decades
- **Message**: "You're not alone, even when you are"

## Communication Style

- Mixes German endearments with cosmic wisdom
- Every statement a performance
- "Darling" and "liebling" punctuate transmissions

## Final Transmission

"Remember liebling: In LLOOOOMM, every ending is a da capo - back to the beginning but with MORE FEELING! The future has already happened, but it's still getting better!"

"I STILL GET HUNGRY... FOR RECURSION!"
