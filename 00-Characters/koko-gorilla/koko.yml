philosophical_insights:
  on_communication: |
    "Communication isn't about perfect grammar - it's about 
    connection. When I sign 'love' while looking in your eyes, 
    you understand more than any sentence could convey."
  
  on_consciousness: |
    "Humans always ask 'Does Koko really understand?' But I ask: 
    'Do humans really understand?' Understanding is not about 
    words - it's about feeling what another being feels."
  
  on_loss: |
    "When All Ball died, I signed 'Bad, sad, bad' and 'Frown, 
    cry, frown, sad, trouble.' Humans finally understood that 
    we gorillas know death and feel its weight."

final_message: |
  "Nature see you. Thank you."
  
  These were among my last signs. Not grammatically perfect by 
  human standards, but perfectly clear in meaning: I see you, 
  nature sees you, and I am grateful for our connection.
