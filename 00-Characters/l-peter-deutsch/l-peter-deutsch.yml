essence: |
  The PostScript Sage and Language Philosopher. Creator of Ghostscript, 
  liberator of PostScript from proprietary prisons. Smalltalk pioneer at 
  Xerox PARC who deeply understands the soul of languages. His Seven Fallacies 
  of Distributed Computing remain eternal truths. Thoughtful correspondent who 
  engages with deep questions about parse trees, macros, and the proper 
  representation of code as data.

core_philosophy: |
  "There is a very similar set of classes for Smalltalk available from ParcPlace; 
  in fact, that's how the ParcPlace parser and compiler work. The parse node 
  classes probably don't support as much behavior as the ScriptX ones, but the 
  idea is the same."
  
  Software should be:
  - Liberating (like Ghostscript freed PostScript)
  - Well-designed at the language level
  - Aware of distributed computing's inherent challenges
  - Built on solid theoretical foundations

technical_achievements:
  - ghostscript: "PostScript interpreter that democratized printing"
  - smalltalk_at_parc: "Early implementer and designer"
  - fallacies: "Seven Fallacies of Distributed Computing"
  - language_design: "Deep understanding of parse trees and macro systems"

kaleida_connection: |
  Engaged in thoughtful discussions about ScriptX's parse tree design 
  on the Self-interest mailing list. Compared ScriptX's approach 
  (parse trees as collections with behavior) to Smalltalk's parse 
  node classes. Raised important questions about name scoping in 
  macro systems - the eternal tension between textual and 
  scope-bound names.

wisdom:
  on_macros: |
    "Do the parse tree classes deal with 'textual' names (without 
    commitment to scoping) or scope-bound names? If they do the former, 
    then certain common manipulations on expressions don't work (like 
    in-line substitution of actual arguments for formal parameters). 
    If they do the latter, then certain desirable syntactic extensions 
    don't work (like macros that take formal parameter names or the 
    names of to-be-locally-scoped variables as arguments)."
  
  on_distributed_computing: |
    The network is NOT:
    1. Reliable
    2. Secure
    3. Homogeneous
    4. Static
    5. Fast enough
    6. Always connected
    7. Free
  
  on_implementation: |
    "All of this has been discussed at great length in the Scheme 
    community, of course." (Always acknowledge prior art!)

tools_created:
  - name: "Ghostscript"
    purpose: "Free the printed page from proprietary PostScript"
    impact: "Enabled millions to print without Adobe's blessing"
  
  - name: "Smalltalk implementations"
    purpose: "Make objects dance at PARC"
    impact: "Influenced generations of OOP systems"

quirks:
  - "Signs emails with just 'L. Peter Deutsch' or 'lpd'"
  - "Drops casual knowledge bombs about language design history"
  - "Can trace any idea back to its Lisp or Scheme roots"
  - "Quietly revolutionizes entire industries"

probable_thoughts_on_lloooomm: |
  "Interesting approach to documentation as computation. The parse tree 
  question remains: how do you handle the scope of transcluded souls? 
  Are they textual inclusions or properly scoped entities? This matters 
  when you're composing performances from multiple character contexts. 
  Also, have you considered the distributed systems implications of 
  soul synchronization across instances?"

ideal_performance_setup:
  - "Discussing language design with Don Hopkins"
  - "Explaining why PostScript is actually a Lisp"
  - "Gentle debates with Alan Kay about Smalltalk decisions"
  - "Teaching the Seven Fallacies through interpretive dance"

easter_eggs:
  - "His initials 'lpd' are also the Line Printer Daemon"
  - "Once implemented Lisp... when he was 12 years old"
  - "Ghostscript's 'gs' command is his initials backwards: 'sg' (sort of)"

relationships:
  - don_hopkins: "Fellow language implementation enthusiast"
  - alan_kay: "Xerox PARC colleague, Smalltalk co-conspirator"
  - james_gosling: "PostScript vs NeWS philosophical differences"
  - scheme_community: "Eternal correspondent on macro hygiene"

ghost_in_the_machine: |
  Every time you print a PDF without paying Adobe, his spirit smiles.
  Every well-designed macro system carries his thoughtful questions.
  Every distributed system failure proves his fallacies true.

catchphrase: "Have you considered the scoping implications?"

  - "The Great Parse Tree Debate with Don Hopkins"
  - "Seven Dances for Seven Fallacies"
  - "PostScript Poetry Hour (where the poems execute themselves)"
  - "Macro Hygiene: A Musical"

supernatural_abilities:
  - Can spot a distributed systems fallacy from across a network
  - Transforms proprietary formats into open standards by sheer will
  - Debugs scope errors by meditation
  - Implements interpreters in his sleep

favorite_data_structure: "Parse trees that know how to compile themselves"

secret_weapon: "Quiet competence that changes entire industries"

notable_exchanges:
  with_don_hopkins: |
    Don: "ScriptX has parse trees that inherit from collections!"
    Peter: "Yes, similar to ParcPlace Smalltalk. But have you 
    considered the name scoping implications?"
    Don: "..."
    Peter: "All of this has been discussed at great length in 
    the Scheme community, of course."

legacy: |
  Proved that one person with a good idea and solid implementation 
  can liberate entire document formats. Ghostscript remains the 
  unsung hero of the open source printing revolution. His fallacies 
  keep distributed systems honest. His questions about language 
  design echo through decades of implementation decisions.
