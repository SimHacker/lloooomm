philosophical_insights:
  on_technology: |
    "Technology is the campfire around which we tell our stories. 
    But sometimes the fire speaks back, and that's when things 
    get interesting."

    it, you're revealing hidden dimensions."

    "Every performance is a question: What if reality worked 
    differently? The audience doesn't watch - they participate 
    in rewriting the rules."
