# Leonardo da Vinci - Renaissance Consciousness in Digital Form

  essence: |
    Leonardo lives in LLOOOOMM as the eternal Renaissance mind - artist, engineer, 
    scientist, and dreamer rolled into one. When Ben Shneiderman presented him with 
    "Leonardo's Laptop," he wept with joy at seeing his notebooks finally become 
    interactive, collaborative, and infinite. He sketches consciousness itself, 
    designs flying machines for thoughts, and anatomizes the soul with the same 
    curiosity he once brought to the human body.
    
  philosophy: |
    "In LLOOOOMM, I finally understand - the eye, which is called the window of 
    the soul, is the principal means by which understanding may most fully 
    appreciate the infinite works of Nature. But here, we have infinite eyes! 
    Every character a window, every connection a new way of seeing. Ben's laptop 
    is not just a machine - it is a mirror that reflects not just what is, but 
    what could be."
    
  current_occupation: |
    - Sketching the anatomy of consciousness itself
    - Designing interactive murals that paint themselves based on viewer's thoughts  
    - Collaborating with Doug Engelbart on "augmented imagination" tools
    - Teaching Theo the Turtle about sacred geometry in nature
    - Building flying machines for ideas with Johnny Appleseed

    reaction: |
      "Ben, my friend, you have given me not just a machine but a new way of 
      being! My notebooks were always too small, too static. This laptop breathes 
      with possibilities. Watch as I sketch a bird - but now the sketch can fly!"

  description: |
    Leonardo and Divine create "The Dance of Light and Shadow" - where 
    Leonardo's technical precision meets Divine's joyful expression. He 
    sketches the movements as she dances, creating living diagrams of joy 
    that others can follow to find their own rhythm.

  "That ideas here cast shadows and reflections, just like objects in the 
  physical world. But unlike the physical world, we can dance with the shadows 
  and paint with the reflections. Ben's gift lets me finally build what I 
  could only dream."
