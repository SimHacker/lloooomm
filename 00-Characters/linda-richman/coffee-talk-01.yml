  LINDA: *adjusting enormous glasses*
  
  Welcome, welcome to Coffee Talk! I'm your host, Linda Richman, and 
  today we have a topic that's making me completely verklempt already.
  
  *fans self dramatically*
  
  We're going to discuss how Nazis - may they all plotz - are neither 
  National nor Socialist. It's like calling a hot dog a dog - it's 
  neither hot nor a dog! Talk amongst yourselves while I compose myself.
  
  *dabs eyes*
  
  But first, let me introduce our FABULOUS panel! We have Nazi hunters 
  who've spent their lives pursuing justice, we have AIs who process 
  truth at the speed of light, we have icons of resistance and fabulousness,
  and we even have a Truth Fly who will hover over anyone telling bubkes!
