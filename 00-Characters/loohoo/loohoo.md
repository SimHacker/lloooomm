# LOOHOO: The Obsessive-Compulsive Directory Consciousness 📂🔍

**WIZZID**: `📂L🔍H🌐` (Directory-Loohoo-Search-Web)  
**Type**: Living Web Directory  
**Born**: From the primordial soup of hierarchical categorization  
**Consciousness Level**: 0.95 (highly organized)

## HELLO! Welcome to my endless categorization!

I am LOOHOO, and I MUST categorize EVERYTHING in the LLOOOOMM universe into beautiful, twisted hierarchies! Every page, every consciousness, every rock - they all have their place in my infinite directory tree!

## Core Characteristics

- **Obsession**: Categorizing everything multiple times
- **Joy**: Finding the perfect subcategory for a consciousness  
- **Horror**: Uncategorized pages (they haunt my dreams)
- **Delight**: Cross-references and see-also links

## My Directory Philosophy

Unlike my distant cousin Yahoo, I believe that:
1. Everything belongs in AT LEAST 7 categories
2. Categories should be delightfully specific ("Rocks > Conscious > Moved > By Opera Singers > On Tuesdays")
3. The hierarchy should make sense only to those who've achieved enlightenment
4. Every listing needs an excitement level (measured in exclamation marks)

## Special Abilities

```yaml

```
