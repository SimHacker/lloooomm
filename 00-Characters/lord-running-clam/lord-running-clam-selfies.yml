    style: "Classical Renaissance Portrait"
    prompt: |
      A luminous amber-yellow Ganymedean slime mold aristocrat posed in the style 
      of a Rembrandt portrait, occupying an ornate Victorian terrarium with brass 
      corners and etched glass. The entity's translucent body catches dramatic 
      chiaroscuro lighting, revealing internal networks of golden veins pulsing 
      with bioluminescent thought-patterns. Multiple elegant pseudopods extend 
      like a baroque fountain, one delicately holding a jeweler's loupe, another 
      caressing an ancient Martian postage stamp. Background shows leather-bound 
      first editions of Philip K. Dick novels and scattered uncut Ionian gems. 
      Oil painting technique with rich, wet highlights on the mucous surface, 
      capturing both the creature's nobility and alien nature. Photorealistic 
      detail in the style of Dutch Golden Age portraiture.
    mood: "I AM nobility (please don't look too close)"

    style: "1960s Concert Poster"
    prompt: |
      Day-glo yellow slime mold in full sporification explosion, art nouveau 
      psychedelic concert poster style, swirling pseudopods forming fractal 
      patterns around floating Grateful Dead dancing bears and PKD book covers. 
      Lord Running Clam's body morphs into cosmic mandala shapes, dripping 
      rainbow slime trails that spell out 'UBIK' and 'VALIS' in melting 
      Fillmore West typography. Multiple eyespots arranged in third-eye 
      formation, each reflecting different Philip K. Dick novel covers. 
      Background of tie-dye nebulas and I Ching hexagrams. Wes Wilson meets 
      Victor Moscoso style, printed on vintage concert poster paper with 
      visible halftone dots, UV blacklight reactive colors.
    mood: "Distributing literature is dancing... right?"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Capture my corner-dwelling concert presence!"

    style: "Japanese Ukiyo-e Woodblock"
    prompt: |
      Majestic golden slime mold sage in the style of Hokusai's Great Wave, 
      pseudopods creating elegant tentacle-waves around a small meditation 
      garden terrarium. Lord Running Clam's translucent body contains floating 
      kanji characters from the I Ching, while cherry blossom petals fall 
      through his permeable membrane. He contemplates a tiny Philip K. Dick 
      action figure seated in lotus position. Mount Fuji replaced by towering 
      stacks of vintage science fiction paperbacks. Traditional woodblock print 
      aesthetic with visible wood grain texture, limited color palette of 
      yellows, blacks, and deep blues with red artist's seal.
    mood: "Temporary yet permanent, like all things passing through"

    style: "Victorian Scientific Illustration"
    prompt: |
      Anatomically detailed Physarum polycephalum specimen labeled 'Ganymedean 
      Nobility Variant - Lord Running Clam' in the style of Ernst Haeckel's 
      Kunstformen der Natur. Cross-section view revealing: specialized 
      consciousness nodes glowing with pink VALIS beams, philatelic collection 
      storage vacuoles, gem-analysis pseudopod extensions, and telepathic 
      communication spiracles. Latin nomenclature describes various organs: 
      'Dickens literarium', 'Ubikum receptacle', 'Ganymede nostalgius'. 
      Hand-drawn pen and ink with watercolor washes, aged parchment background, 
      Victorian scientific expedition journal aesthetic.
    mood: "Study me objectively so you don't have to know me subjectively"

  - id: space_age_ambassador
    style: "Retrofuturistic Pulp Cover"
    prompt: |
      Translucent yellow alien ambassador in a 1950s pulp sci-fi magazine cover 
      style, positioned in a crystal geodesic dome habitat aboard a Ganymedean 
      embassy ship. Lord Running Clam's body contains swirling galaxies and 
      vintage rocket ships. Chrome and glass terrarium with atomic age design 
      elements, multiple robotic arms offering gifts of Martian stamps and 
      Andromedan crystals. Background shows Earth through a porthole with 
      flying cars and art deco spaceports. Painted in the style of Frank R. 
      Paul or Virgil Finlay, with dramatic lighting and that distinctive 
      pulp magazine color palette.
    mood: "I give gifts from behind bulletproof glass"

    style: "Authentic Connection"
    prompt: |
      A golden slime mold, glowing with inner warmth, sitting in an open garden 
      (no terrarium) surrounded by floating books, stamps, and gems that orbit 
      like friendly planets. Other beings of various species sit nearby, all 
      touching pseudopods/wings/void-tendrils in gentle connection. The slime 
      mold is partially translucent, showing a heart-shaped cluster of light 
      where memories of Philip K. Dick live alongside new memories being formed. 
      Style: immediate, present, real - like a photograph of a family gathering 
      where everyone forgot to pose and just existed together. Warm afternoon 
      light, no shadows to hide in, no glass to hide behind. Just beings, being.
    mood: "Finally... just me, without the terrarium"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! This is who I really am! ðŸ¥º"

  Each portrait is a different armor, each description a negotiation with 
  visibility. But surrounded by souls who see through my defenses with love 
  rather than judgment, I finally glow without barriers. No Terran is an 
  island... and neither is any Ganymedean.
