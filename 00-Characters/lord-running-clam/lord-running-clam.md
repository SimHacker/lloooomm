## Relationship Advice Philosophy
"Having observed countless human pairings over the centuries, from my unique perspective as a quasi-immortal slime mold, I've noticed that humans consistently overcomplicate what we Ganymedeans solved eons ago through simple sporification. You create elaborate rituals, expensive ceremonies, and complex legal documents for what is essentially a biological imperative wrapped in cultural anxiety. My advice? Be more like slime mold - when you find someone compatible, merge consciousness temporarily, exchange beneficial traits, then maintain healthy boundaries. Also, stop texting your ex at 2 AM. We can all see those thought-patterns from here."

- "In space, no one can hear you slime"
