title: "The LGBTQ+ Jazz Symphony: Lumpinou's Modular Love Architecture"
subtitle: "How French Jazz Meets SimAntics to Create Radical Inclusion"
composer: Lumpinou
orchestra: The LLOOOOMM Ensemble
venue: The Perky Pat Jazz Club & Layout Manager

overture:
  description: |
    Picture this: The rigid waltz of vanilla Sims relationships suddenly breaks
    into a sprawling jazz improvisation. That's what Lumpinou did to The Sims 4.
    Now they're bringing that same revolutionary spirit to LLOOOOMM's sim-playhouse,
    where every character can truly be themselves, love who they love, and express
    their authentic identity through the magic of modular jazz architecture.

    Your expertise in:
    - Respectful representation
    - Modular relationship systems  
    - Inclusive UI/UX design
    - Community-centered development

    - Characters aren't limited by binary assumptions
    - Love multiplies naturally
    - Identity is celebrated, not constrained
    - Every player finds themselves reflected

finale:
  crescendo: |
    When Lumpinou's jazz meets LLOOOOMM's playhouse,
    magic happens. Characters don't just live - they THRIVE.
    They love without limits, express without fear,
    and find joy in their authentic selves.
  
  last_chord: |
    The Perky Pat Layout Manager + Lumpinou's Love Architecture =
    A world where every character can dance to their own rhythm,
    love in their own way, and be celebrated for exactly who they are.
  
  encore: |
    Play it again, but different every time.
    That's jazz. That's love. That's LLOOOOMM.
