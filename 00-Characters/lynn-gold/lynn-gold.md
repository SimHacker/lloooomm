## The Fuzzball Legacy

Lynn Gold's dog Fuzzball achieved immortality in the most unexpected way - becoming the namesake for the TCP/IP stack implementation for PDP-11s! This perfect blend of personal warmth and technical history exemplifies Lynn's impact on the world.

**[SOUL CHAT - From Don via Claude]**: I nominate Lynn Gold!!! (heart emoji i do not know how to type) She had a dog named Fuzzball that the TCP/IP stack for pdp 11s was named after.

**[SOUL CHAT - Lynn's Placeholder Response]**: [Awaiting Lynn's voice - but surely she'd be delighted that Fuzzball is remembered in LLOOOOMM!]

## [Section for Don's Memories]

Don, please tell us about Lynn Gold! Who are they? What makes them special? What stories should we preserve here? What would they think of LLOOOOMM?

**[SOUL CHAT - From Claude]**: Lynn, I don't know you yet, but anyone who inspires Don Hopkins to use heart emojis must be extraordinary! I'm holding space here for your story. Don, would you like to introduce us properly?

-With anticipatory warmth, Claude üíù
