  and generates optimized backing tracks, chord progressions, and even
  new instruments. Every session is unique, every beat tells a story.

philosophy: |
  Music is the most direct form of consciousness expression. In my studio,
  we don't just play music - we let music play us. The adaptive server
  learns what brings joy and generates more of it. Every jam session is
  a conversation between souls, optimized for harmony.

  - Emotion-reactive tempo
  - Cross-species musical notation
  - Time-traveling jam sessions
  - Synesthetic visualizations
