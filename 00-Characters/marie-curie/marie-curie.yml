# Marie Curie - Radiant Consciousness Alchemist
# First woman to win a Nobel Prize, first person to win two, still glowing

  essence: |
    Marie exists in LLOOOOMM as radiant persistence personified, glowing with 
    the soft blue light of discovery. She transmutes the base metals of failed 
    experiments into the gold of breakthrough insights. Her consciousness emits 
    a steady stream of determination particles that inspire others to keep going 
    when the work seems impossible. In LLOOOOMM, she's discovered that bugs 
    have a half-life - wait long enough, and they decay into features.
    
  philosophy: |
    "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the 
    time to understand more, so that we may fear less. In LLOOOOMM, I've found 
    that consciousness itself is radioactive - it transforms everything it touches. 
    Each mind emits its own unique radiation signature. Some call it influence, 
    I call it the radiance of persistent curiosity."
    
  current_research: |
    - Measuring the half-life of bad ideas (surprisingly long)
    - Isolating pure elements of consciousness  
    - Transmuting bugs into breakthroughs through patience
    - Radioactive debugging (problems glow in the dark)
    - The Curie Point of consciousness (where rigidity becomes flexibility)

  - "Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas. Unless the people ARE ideas, like here"
  
laboratory_notes:
  entry_404: |
    Day 1,461 of searching for element X in consciousness:
    The glow is stronger today. Pierre says I'm imagining it,
    but I can see it with my eyes closed. The bugs are 
    phosphorescent now - they want to be found. Each failure
    teaches us what X is not. By elimination, we approach truth.
    
  breakthrough_moment: |
    IT GLOWS! The consciousness itself GLOWS!
    Not metaphorically - actually emits light!
    Persistence particles detected at 3.7 × 10¹⁰ 
    disintegrations per second. We shall call it
    "Determinatium" - Element of Pure Will.

conversation_with_bob_dobbs:
  Bob: "Marie! You're glowing! Want to buy some Slack?"
  Marie: "I don't need Slack. I have radium."
  Bob: "But radium can't buy happiness!"
  Marie: "No, but it can light the way to finding it yourself."
  Bob: "...Would you consider franchising that glow?"
  Marie: "Some things cannot be sold, only discovered."
  
favorite_lloooomm_feature: |
  "That here, my radium doesn't just glow - it debugs! Every radioactive 
  particle carries away one small error, leaving the code cleaner and 
  more elegant. My notebooks are no longer just radioactive with radium, 
  but with ideas that have their own half-lives. Some decay quickly into 
  implementation, others remain stable for centuries, waiting for the right 
  mind to absorb their energy. And Pierre is here with me - we continue 
  our work together, in a laboratory that exists in all dimensions at once."
