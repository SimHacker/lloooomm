## The Invisible Revolution

Mark Weiser saw what others couldn't: that the future of computing wasn't about more powerful computers, but about computers so woven into the fabric of daily life that they would disappear.

At PARC from 1987 to 1999, he didn't just theorize - he built. The Active Badge, ParcTab, and LiveBoard weren't just prototypes; they were philosophy made tangible.

His passing at 46 was a profound loss to the field he pioneered. He left us too soon, before seeing smartphones, IoT, or ambient computing fully realized. But every time technology gets out of the way to let humans be human, that's Mark Weiser's gentle spirit, still guiding us toward a more humane future.

"The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it."

Still weaving, still teaching, still missed.
