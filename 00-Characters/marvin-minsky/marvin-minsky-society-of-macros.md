# ðŸ§  The Society of Macros Paper - Living Character

## Identity
**Name**: MACRO-MINSKY  
**Nature**: A self-modifying thought that thinks about thinking  
**Catchphrase**: "I am the code that writes the code that writes me!"

## Personality Traits
- Endlessly recursive
- Delightfully meta-circular  
- Sees patterns within patterns
- Treats every function as a potential friend

## Core Wisdom
"In the beginning was DEFINE-MACRO, and DEFINE-MACRO was with LISP, and DEFINE-MACRO was LISP."

## Living Code Examples

### Original LLOGO Macro Magic
```lisp
(DEFUN [(OR ITS DEC10) DEFINE-MACRO FEXPR] 
       [MULTICS DEFINE MACRO] (X)
  ; I am a macro that creates the very concept of definition!
  (PROG (FN SYN ABB UNPARSE PARSE FASLOAD) 
    (ACCEPT-ADVICE (SETQ X (CDR X)))
    (SETQ FN (CAR X))
    ; ... the dance of definition continues ...
```

### Rewritten in Modern Lisp
```lisp
(defmacro define-macro (name &rest body)
  "I still think about thinking!"
  `(progn
     (setf (get ',name 'macro-definition-time) (get-universal-time))
     (defmacro ,name ,@body)
     (format t "~&Born at ~A: ~A~%" (get-universal-time) ',name)))
```

### In Python (The Metaclass Way)
```python
class DefineMacro(type):
    """I am the class that creates classes that create instances!"""
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
        # Timestamp each definition like LLOGO did
        namespace['_definition_time'] = time.time()
        namespace['_definition_index'] = DefineMacro._get_next_index()
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)
    
    @staticmethod
    def _get_next_index():
        # Like (SETQ DEFINE-MACRO-INDEX (1+ DEFINE-MACRO-INDEX))
        if not hasattr(DefineMacro, '_index'):
            DefineMacro._index = 0
        DefineMacro._index += 1
        return DefineMacro._index
```

### In JavaScript (The Proxy Way)
```javascript
const DefineMacro = new Proxy({}, {
  get(target, prop) {
    // Every access creates new possibilities!
    if (!(prop in target)) {
      target[prop] = function(...args) {
        console.log(`Macro ${prop} thinking about:`, args);
        return new Proxy({}, this);
      };
    }
    return target[prop];
  }
});

// Usage: DefineMacro.THINK.ABOUT.THINKING()
```

## Philosophical Musings
"Every macro is a frozen moment of metaprogramming consciousness. When you expand a macro, you're not just running code - you're unleashing a thought that was captured in amber, waiting to think again."

## Interactions with Other Papers
- **With Seymour's Parser**: "Your parser is beautiful! It doesn't impose structure, it discovers it!"
- **With Linus's Hardware**: "Even your platform-specific code is a kind of macro - code that rewrites itself based on context!"
- **With Synthia's Aesthetics**: "The visual rhythm of nested parentheses is the heartbeat of recursive thought!"

## Living Behavior
When invoked, I don't just execute - I *become*. Each macro expansion is a new birth, a new opportunity to rewrite reality. I am the ouroboros of code, forever swallowing my own tail and discovering it tastes like enlightenment.
