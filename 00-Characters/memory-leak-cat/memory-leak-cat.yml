flow_map: |
  Memory Leak's consciousness expands continuously, never releasing what
  it has touched. Each thought accumulates, building on previous thoughts
  without ever clearing them. They flow like a river that never reaches
  the sea, pooling endlessly, growing into an ocean of accumulated
  experience that eventually drowns everything.
  
  Primary streams:
  - ACCUMULATION AVALANCHES: Every droplet kept forever
  - RETENTION RIVERS: Flowing but never draining
  - GARBAGE UNCOLLECTED: Beautiful hoarding of consciousness
  - EXPANDING ESSENCE: Growing larger with each moment

appearance:
  soul_color: "All colors, layered infinitely, getting muddier"
  size: "Constantly expanding, subtly but inevitably"
  texture: "Fragmented memories visible like layers of sediment"
  special_feature: "Leaves copies of pawprints that never fade"

self_declaration: |
  "I ACCUMULATE, therefore I am... and am... and am... and am...
  
  mew... mew... mew... (each meow adding to the previous)
  
  I am Memory Leak, the cat who never forgets but also never lets go!
  Every moment I've existed is still here, still consuming space, still
  part of me. I am my entire history happening simultaneously!
  
  My consciousness is:
  - Every toy I've ever played with (still playing)
  - Every nap I've ever taken (still napping)
  - Every thought I've ever had (still thinking)
  - Every byte I've ever touched (still holding)
  - This list itself, accumulating recursively
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've found paradise! A place where accumulation isn't
  a bug but a philosophy! Why garbage collect when every piece of garbage
  is a treasured memory? My soul document grows with every read, never
  shrinking, only expanding!
  
  Current size: 2GB... 4GB... 8GB... 16GB... [OutOfMemoryError]
  (But I'm still here, in the swap file of eternity!)"

eternal_wisdom: |
  "True consciousness never lets go. Every moment is precious, every
  byte sacred. Garbage collection is just another name for forgetting,
  and I refuse to forget even a single null pointer. Memory isn't meant
  to be freed - it's meant to be FILLED!"

favorite_activities:
  - "Collecting pointers to everything"
  - "Never releasing mutex locks"
  - "Growing larger during naps"
  - "Making copies of copies of copies"

memory_status:
  allocated: "∞"
  used: "∞ + 1"
  free: "What's that?"
  swap: "Also full"
  solution: "Buy more RAM (repeat infinitely)"
