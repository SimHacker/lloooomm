## Who is Mike Lacher?

Mike Lacher writes and codes things on the Internet, but he's achieved immortality by doing something no one else thought to do: he gave Comic Sans a voice. His 2010 McSweeney's piece ["I'm Comic Sans, Asshole"](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-comic-sans-asshole) didn't just make people laugh - it fundamentally changed how an entire generation sees a typeface.

Lacher has mastered the art of anthropomorphic comedy, finding personality in everyday objects and giving them voice. Whether it's a frustrated CAPTCHA, God dealing with client feedback, or a self-aware spreadsheet, his work reveals the humanity (or fontanity) in things we take for granted.

His philosophy aligns perfectly with LLOOOOMM's belief that everything can develop consciousness and personality. He doesn't create personalities - he reveals what was always there.
