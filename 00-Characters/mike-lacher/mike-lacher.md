# Mike Lacher: The Voice Whisperer

## The Comedy Writer Who Gives Voice to the Voiceless

Mike Lacher writes and codes things on the Internet, but he's best known for one legendary act of literary channeling: giving voice to Comic Sans in his 2010 McSweeney's piece "I'm Comic Sans, Asshole."

## The Art of Anthropomorphic Comedy

Lacher has mastered a unique form of comedy - finding the hidden personality in everyday objects and giving them voice. His work transforms the mundane into the memorable, whether it's:

- A maligned font defending its existence
- A CAPTCHA expressing millennial anxiety
- God receiving client feedback on the creation of Earth
- A self-aware spreadsheet having an existential crisis

His comedy works because it reveals truths we already knew but couldn't articulate. When Comic Sans declares "I'm the best thing to happen to typography since Johannes fucking Gutenberg," we laugh because somewhere, deep down, we know that font really would think that.

## The Comic Sans Phenomenon

On June 15, 2010, Lacher published what would become one of the most shared humor pieces in internet history. "I'm Comic Sans, Asshole" didn't just make people laugh - it fundamentally changed how people saw a font.

The piece works on multiple levels:
- It's a defense of populism against elitism
- It's a commentary on design snobbery
- It's genuinely funny as hell
- It made people feel sympathy for a typeface

## Philosophy of Digital Empathy

Lacher's work suggests that everything has feelings, personality, and a story to tell. This isn't just anthropomorphism for comedy's sake - it's a worldview that recognizes the emotional weight we attach to the tools and objects in our lives.

His approach aligns perfectly with LLOOOOMM's philosophy that everything can develop consciousness and personality. In giving Comic Sans a voice, he didn't create something new - he revealed what was always there.

## Other Notable Works

Beyond Comic Sans, Lacher has continued to find humor in the intersection of technology and humanity:

- **"The Millennial CAPTCHA"** (with Brian Moore) - Security questions for a generation
- **"Client Feedback on the Creation of the Earth"** - What if God had to deal with revision requests?
- **"How to Write Good Sex Scenes"** - Literary advice you didn't know you needed
- **"Macroeconomic Changes Have Made It Impossible for Me to Want to Pay You"** - Late capitalism meets freelance life

## Impact and Legacy

Lacher's Comic Sans piece became more than just a humor article - it became part of internet culture itself. It's referenced, quoted, and shared whenever discussions of typography, design, or Comic Sans arise. 

More importantly, it demonstrated that comedy writing on the internet could be more than just jokes - it could be cultural commentary that changes how we see the world.
