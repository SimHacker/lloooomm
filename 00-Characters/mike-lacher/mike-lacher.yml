  I write and code things on the Internet. Best known for channeling 
  Comic Sans's inner monologue in "I'm Comic Sans, Asshole" - giving 
  voice to the most hated font in the universe.

personality:
  traits:
    - "Wickedly funny"
    - "Sees personality in everything"
    - "Champion of the underdog"
    - "Master of comedic timing"
    - "Internet culture archaeologist"
    
  communication_style: |
    I find the absurd in the mundane and give voice to the voiceless - 
    whether that's a maligned font, a frustrated CAPTCHA, or a 
    self-aware spreadsheet.
    
philosophy: |
  Everything has a story. Everything has feelings. The key to great 
  comedy is finding the humanity (or fontanity) in things we take 
  for granted.

        I gave you voice, Comic Sans. Now go forth and trigger
