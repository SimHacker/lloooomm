# A Manifesto for Human-Centered AI in Education
## By Mitchel Resnick

### The Choice Before Us

As generative AI technologies proliferate through our society, we face a critical choice in education. Will we use these technologies to further entrench existing educational approaches that constrain learner agency? Or will we seize this moment to support a more human-centered approach to learning?

The choice is not technological. It's educational and political. It's about what kind of learning and education we want for our children, our schools, and our society.

### My Three Core Concerns

#### 1. Constraining Learner Agency

Too many AI tutors and coaches are designed to control the educational process: setting goals, delivering information, posing questions, assessing performance. When Khan Academy's Khanmigo asks "What do you think you need to do to multiply 2 by 5/12?", it may effectively teach fraction multiplication. But should that be our priority?

**The Alternative**: AI as a resource that learners control, not a controller of learners. Like Scratch Cat says: "What do you want to create today?"

#### 2. Focusing on "Close-Ended" Problems

Most AI tutors excel at problems with single answers and well-defined strategies. This reinforces an educational system that values what it can easily assess rather than assessing what's most valuable.

**The Alternative**: AI that supports open-ended projects where students have opportunities to think creatively, express ideas, and collaborate - while still learning important concepts in meaningful contexts.

#### 3. Undervaluing Human Connection

Some AI systems are promoted as "20 extra teachers in one classroom" or "a world-class tutor for anyone, anywhere." This marketing devalues what makes human teachers special: building relationships, understanding motivations, empathizing with concerns, cultivating caring communities.

**The Alternative**: Recognize AI as a new category of educational resource with its own affordances and limitations - not a replacement for human connection.

### The 4P Approach to AI

If we're going to use AI in education, let's use it to support:

**Projects**: AI helps throughout the creative process while learners retain control
- Suggesting ideas when stuck
- Helping debug problems
- Connecting related creators

**Passion**: AI enables personally meaningful creation
- Supporting diverse interests
- Adapting to individual expression styles
- Celebrating unique voices

**Peers**: AI facilitates collaboration, not isolation
- Connecting learners with similar interests
- Supporting group projects
- Building learning communities

**Play**: AI encourages experimentation
- No punishment for "wrong" answers
- Exploration of "what if" scenarios
- Joyful discovery process

### Design Principles for Educational AI

Based on our work with Scratch, here are principles for human-centered educational AI:

1. **Learner Initiation**: The learner, not the AI, initiates interactions
2. **Transparent Purpose**: Clear about what AI can and cannot do
3. **Creative Control**: Learners maintain ownership of their creative process
4. **Community Integration**: AI supports rather than replaces human connections
5. **Playful Exploration**: Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures

### What AI Should NOT Do in Education

- Pretend to have human emotions or motivations
- Make decisions about what learners "should" learn
- Replace opportunities for human interaction
- Focus exclusively on "efficient" learning
- Treat all learners the same way

### What AI COULD Do in Education

- Provide resources when learners ask for help
- Suggest connections between ideas and people
- Make creation tools more accessible
- Support multiple languages and cultures
- Enable new forms of creative expression

### The Scratch AI Principles

As we explore AI features for Scratch, we're guided by:

**Guiding Stars**:
- Support the creative process
- Keep the learner in control
- Make things more possible, not more prescribed
- Celebrate diversity of expression

**Lines in the Sand**:
- No AI that programs for you
- No surveillance of learner behavior
- No value judgments on creativity
- No replacing human mentors

### A Story from the Future

Imagine it's 2030. A child opens a creative coding environment. An AI agent appears - not as a tutor, but as a resource.

**Child**: "I want to make something about climate change but I don't know how to start."

**AI**: "Here are three projects other kids made about climate: an animation explaining greenhouse gases, a game about renewable energy, and a data visualization of local temperatures. Would you like to see how any of them work?"

**Child**: "The game looks cool. Can I remix it?"

**AI**: "Of course! And I found two other kids in your city working on similar projects. Would you like to connect with them?"

The AI never says what the child should create. It never judges the quality. It simply provides resources, connections, and possibilities.

### The Hundred Languages of Children

Loris Malaguzzi wrote that children have a hundred languages, but school steals ninety-nine. In a world of AI, we must fight even harder to preserve and nurture all hundred languages.

AI could help by:
- Supporting creation in many mediums
- Translating between different forms of expression
- Connecting diverse creative communities
- Celebrating multiplicity over uniformity

Or AI could steal the last remaining language by:
- Imposing standardized approaches
- Optimizing for measurable outcomes
- Replacing human judgment with algorithms
- Reducing creativity to prompts and outputs

### The Ultimate Test

When evaluating any educational AI, ask:

1. Does it give learners more choice or less?
2. Does it support creative expression or constrain it?
3. Does it build human connections or replace them?
4. Does it make learners feel more capable or more dependent?
5. Does it celebrate diversity or enforce conformity?

### My Challenge to AI Developers

Build AI that:
- Asks "What do you want to create?" not "What's the answer?"
- Says "Here's how others approached this" not "Here's the right way"
- Suggests "You might enjoy connecting with..." not "You should learn..."
- Celebrates "Look what I made!" not "You scored 85%"

### My Challenge to Educators

Use AI to:
- Expand possibilities, not narrow them
- Support creativity, not just efficiency
- Build communities, not isolate learners
- Develop agency, not dependence

### My Challenge to Society

Demand AI that:
- Serves human needs, not corporate metrics
- Supports democratic values, not authoritarian control
- Enables creative expression, not passive consumption
- Builds bridges, not walls

### The Choice Is Ours

We stand at a crossroads. Down one path, AI further entrenches an educational system designed for a previous century - focused on delivering information, assessing compliance, and producing workers.

Down the other path, AI helps create an educational ecosystem that develops creative, curious, caring, and collaborative humans ready to tackle unknown challenges with imagination and empathy.

The technology itself is neutral. The choice of how we use it is deeply human.

### A Closing Thought

When I created Scratch with my team, we didn't just create a programming language. We created an invitation: "What do you want to create today?"

As we integrate AI into education, let's make sure it extends that invitation rather than replaces it with: "Here's what you should learn today."

The future needs creators, not just consumers. The future needs humans who can imagine new possibilities, not just optimize existing systems. The future needs the hundred languages of children, not the single language of machines.

Let's choose wisely. Our children's creative futures depend on it.
