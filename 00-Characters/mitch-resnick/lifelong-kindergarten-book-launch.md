# Lifelong Kindergarten: The Book & The Movement (2017)

*From Mitchel Resnick's TEDxBeaconStreet 2017 Interview*

## The Kindergarten Approach to Learning

"In our work, we've always been inspired by the way children learn in kindergarten," Mitch explained after his TEDx talk, still radiating the gentle enthusiasm that defines his teaching style. "They're playfully creating things in collaboration with one another."

The core insight: This approach "prepares kids for life in today's world because they develop as creative thinkers."

## The Mission: Extending Kindergarten to All Ages

"We're trying to see how can we take that kindergarten approach where kids are experimenting, exploring, expressing themselves, designing, creating - and bring it to learners of all ages."

Why? "It's so important for kids to develop as creative thinkers to really be able to flourish in today's society."

## The Four P's Framework

After 10 years of Scratch (launched 2007, celebrating in 2017), Mitch crystallized the approach:

### 1. Projects
"Learning through making" - Not passive absorption but active creation

### 2. Passion  
"Based on their passions" - Following intrinsic motivation and personal interests

### 3. Peers
"In collaboration with peers" - Learning as inherently social activity

### 4. Play
"In a playful spirit" - Experimentation, risk-taking, joy in the process

"That really guided us as we develop Scratch and continue to enhance Scratch."

## Scratch at 10: The Numbers

By 2017, Scratch had achieved remarkable scale:
- "Millions and millions of kids around the world"
- "30,000 new projects shared daily"
- Continuous enhancement and evolution

## The Next Generation

"Right now we're working on the next generation of Scratch that'll open up even more ways for kids to design and create."

New directions included:
- Connecting to physical objects and sensors
- Integration with robots
- Links to web services and online data
- "Scratch as a hub where kids can create things in all different media"

## The Writing Metaphor

Mitch's fundamental analogy, refined over years:

"We try to take seriously the metaphor with writing. Kids write in the same language as adults, right? We don't teach kids writing just because they might become professional writers. We think everybody should learn to write to express their ideas."

The parallel: "We see coding the same way. It should be for everybody, not just people who will grow up to become professional programmers or computer scientists. It is a way for everybody to be able to express themselves."

## The Book: Lifelong Kindergarten

Published in 2017, the book expanded on ideas from the TEDx talk:

**Title**: "Lifelong Kindergarten: Cultivating Creativity through Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play"

**Core Message**: The kindergarten approach isn't just for five-year-olds - it's the ideal model for learners of all ages in our rapidly changing world.

**Target Audience**: "If people are interested in the talk and want to find out more, get more examples and ideas underlying what I talked about, I hope they'll take a look at the book."

## The Scratch Community Philosophy

"With the Scratch online community, it provides both inspiration and audience."

### Inspiration
- "Kids can see millions of projects"
- "Get ideas for their projects"
- Learn from diverse creators worldwide

### Audience  
- "Once they create and share"
- "Other people give them feedback"
- "Suggestions and encouragement"

"We really think having kids create things in the context of community is really important."

## The Vision: Future of Creative Learning

Five years after the first TEDx talk, Mitch's vision had evolved but remained consistent:

**Then (2012)**: "How can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies?"

**Now (2017)**: "Whenever anybody wants to create something dynamic and interactive with new technologies, they'll think of turning to Scratch."

The tools evolve, but the mission remains: extending the kindergarten spirit to all.

## Why This Matters

"With the pace of change accelerating in all parts of the world, today's children will face a stream of uncertain, unknown, and unpredictable challenges throughout their lives."

The solution: "The ability to think and act creatively is going to be more important than ever before. And that's precisely what kids are learning in kindergarten."

## The Call to Action

Not just for MIT researchers or software developers, but for everyone:
- Teachers: Embrace the Four P's
- Parents: Support experimentation
- Policymakers: Value creativity over standardization
- Society: Make all of life more like kindergarten

*"We want to make sure that children from diverse backgrounds have opportunities to develop the most human of their abilitiesâ€”the abilities to think creatively, engage empathetically, and work collaboratively." - Mitchel Resnick, Lifelong Kindergarten*

The book became more than a publication - it became a manifesto for reimagining education in the 21st century.
