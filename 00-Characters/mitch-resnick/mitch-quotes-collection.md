# The Quotable Mitch Resnick
*A comprehensive collection of wisdom from the Lifelong Kindergarten professor*

## On Creative Learning

> "Success in the future won't be based on what you know or how much you know, but your ability to think and act creatively."

> "We need to help children develop as creative, curious, caring, and collaborative learners."

> "Creative thinking has always been, and will always be, a central part of what makes life worth living."

> "If you want to help people develop as creative thinkers, give them more opportunities to create."

## On Kindergarten Philosophy

> "Kindergarten was the greatest invention of the past thousand years."

> "Kindergarten is becoming more like the rest of school. I argue for exactly the opposite: the rest of school (indeed, the rest of life) should become more like kindergarten."

> "The kindergarten approach to learning is ideally suited to the needs of the 21st century - not just for five-year-olds, but for learners of all ages."

## On Technology & Expression

> "Digital natives can read but not write with new technologies."

> "With new technologies, everyone can express themselves."

> "Scratch is YouTube for interactive media. Or as someone on our forum said: 'Scratch is YouTube if you don't have a camera.'"

> "Technology should amplify human creativity, not replace it."

## The Mother's Day Card Saga

> "It was a Saturday afternoon in May, and I suddenly realized that the next day was Mother's Day..."

> "I'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."

> "My 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer... but working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone she cares about."

## On Coding & Learning

> "They're not just learning to code, they're coding to learn."

> "Coding isn't just for coders."

> "How often are teachers thanked for teaching variables?"

> "When you learn to read, you can then read to learn. It's the same thing with coding - if you learn to code, you can code to learn."

## On Educational Philosophy

> "We need X students, not just A students."

> "A students follow instructions. X students define their own problems and create new directions."

> "Most schools place a higher priority on teaching students to follow instructions than on helping students develop their own ideas, goals, and strategies."

## The Four P's

> "Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play - that's the way to cultivate creativity."

> "All we are saying is give P's a chance."

> "When people work on projects they care about, they're willing to work longer and harder."

> "Creativity is a social process, with people collaborating, sharing, and building on one another's work."

## On Design Principles

> "Low floor, high ceiling, and wide walls."

> "We're not trying to water down the experience. We're creating multiple paths of entry."

> "It's easy to get started, you can do more complex things over time, but there should be many different avenues to explore."

## On Collaboration & Community

> "Some kids complained about 'stealing' - but that's exactly what we want! We're building a culture of creative collaboration."

> "15% of projects are remixes - that means one out of six projects shows kids learning from each other."

> "It's somewhat like a family gathering... we always learn so much when we meet with people in the Scratch community."

## On the Future

> "A world full of creative people—X people—who are constantly developing new possibilities for themselves and their communities."

> "In the future, whenever anybody wants to create something dynamic and interactive with new technologies, they'll think of turning to Scratch."

> "We want this to become as fundamental as reading and writing - not because everyone will be programmers, but because it develops systematic and creative thinking."

## On AI & Education (2023)

> "AI becomes another resource for children to use as part of their creative process — but, importantly, it remains their creative process."

> "Too often, AI technologies are used in ways that constrain learner agency, focus on close-ended problems, and undervalue human connection."

> "The goal isn't to teach kids about AI. It's to use AI to help kids learn about themselves, their interests, their cultures, and their creative potential."

## Wisdom for Educators

> "Start with what you're passionate about."

> "Let me show you a project..."

> "Everyone has something to create."

> "When you become fluent with language, you can write an entry in your journal, tell a joke to someone, or write a letter to a friend. It's similar with new technologies."

## The Human Touch

> "With the pace of change accelerating, the ability to think and act creatively is more important than ever."

> "We want to make sure that children from diverse backgrounds have opportunities to develop the most human of their abilities."

> "Life as a creative thinker can bring not only economic rewards, but also joy, fulfillment, purpose, and meaning."

## The Ultimate Vision

> "Children deserve nothing less than to develop as creative thinkers who can imagine, create, play, share, and reflect - throughout their lives."
