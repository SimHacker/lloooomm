# The Pico Cricket Story: Wide Walls for Creative Learning

*From Mitch Resnick's 2007 Dust or Magic presentation*

## The Robot Competition Problem

"Although LEGO Mindstorms has been very successful - we've sold over a million of these kits around the world - we had some frustrations," Mitch explained, adjusting his colorful shirt as he addressed the Dust or Magic conference.

The issue? Robot competitions. While exciting for some, they created narrow walls rather than wide ones. Most participants were boys. The girls who participated did wonderful things, but the gender imbalance was stark.

"Take a look at this," Mitch showed a slide of a typical robotics competition poster. "Do you think that's going to appeal to everyone?"

## Enter the Cricket

The solution came in the form of the Pico Cricket - a kit designed with "wide walls" in mind. Not just robots that navigate mazes, but creations that could be anything.

### The Musical Hat

"A child made a little cat that purrs," Mitch demonstrated, his eyes lighting up. "They built in a light sensor so when the light level goes down, it plays a lullaby. Same logical thinking as a robot - wait until sensor input, then respond - but in a meaningful, motivated way."

### The Dancing Sculpture  

Another child created a kinetic sculpture where the speed of movement responded to sound levels. "They're learning about relations between speeds and sensors, exploring mathematical ideas, but through creative expression."

## The Company That Almost Wasn't

LEGO decided not to make Pico Cricket an official product. They were focused on the successful Mindstorms NXT for robot builders. But something magical happened.

"The owner of LEGO - it's still family-owned, the grandson of the founder - was interested enough to say: 'Start a company. We'll collaborate. You use our parts, we'll use your technology.'"

Thus Playful Invention Company was born.

## Global Impact, Unexpected Places

"About a third of sales in the first year were in Asia," Mitch noted with surprise. "The idea of creative thinking resonates strongly there. They see it as a serious problem - students leave school lacking creativity needed for the workforce."

### Hong Kong Workshop: Wearable Inventions
- A boy created a wearable jukebox that played different tunes based on which coins you inserted
- A girl programmed lights on her boots to change colors based on her walking pattern

### Iceland Workshop: Home Inventions  
- Room security system with light beam breakers
- Automatic toilet paper dispenser (because everyone needs one)
- An alarm clock that ruffles your hair and plays music when light hits it

"But wait," the inventor realized, "In Iceland, light doesn't come through windows in the morning!" His solution? He added to his poster: "For Export Only"

## The Philosophy

"We want kids creating, not just interacting," Mitch emphasized. "Electronic toys where you pet them and they purr - that's interaction. We want creation."

The Pico Cricket embodied this philosophy:
- Arts and crafts materials alongside electronics
- Motors, lights, sounds, and sensors
- Programming through Scratch-like blocks
- Focus on personal expression over competition

## The Creative Learning Spiral Lives

Every Pico Cricket project followed the same pattern:
1. **Imagine**: A musical instrument, a creature, a kinetic sculpture
2. **Create**: Build with diverse materials
3. **Play**: Experiment with sensors and responses
4. **Share**: Show others, get feedback
5. **Reflect**: How did it work? What next?

"It's the same learning whether building a maze-solving robot or a musical hat," Mitch concluded. "But with wide walls, more kids find their passion."

## Legacy

The Pico Cricket proved that educational technology doesn't need to be narrow. By expanding from "just robots" to "anything you can imagine," it reached kids who might never have tried programming.

As one workshop participant put it: "I'm not into robots, but I love fashion. Now I can program my clothes!"

That's the power of wide walls.
