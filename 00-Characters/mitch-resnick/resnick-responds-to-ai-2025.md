# Mitch Resnick Responds: AI & Creative Learning in 2025

## "It Was a Saturday Afternoon in January..."

*January 2025*

It was a Saturday afternoon in January, and I was watching my granddaughter use the new version of Scratch. But something was different. She wasn't just dragging blocks - she was talking to them, gesturing at them, and they were responding in ways that matched her abilities perfectly.

"Grandpa Mitch," she said, "watch this!" She spoke to her screen: "I want my cat to dance when it hears music." The AI didn't write the code for her. Instead, it helped her explore different ways to make it happen, suggesting blocks she might use, but letting her make the choices.

That's when I realized: we'd done it. We'd found a way to use AI that enhances creative learning rather than replacing it.

## My Three Concerns from 2023 - Revisited

### 1. ❌ Constraining Learner Agency → ✅ Expanding Creative Choice

**2023 Fear**: AI tutors would control the learning process
**2025 Reality**: AI as creative collaborator, not controller

Today's AI in Scratch works like this:
```scratch
when [child has idea]
  AI suggests [multiple paths]
  child chooses [their way]
  AI supports [their choice]
  creativity remains [with child]
```

The AI never says "Here's the answer." It says "Here are some ways you might explore your idea."

### 2. ❌ Close-Ended Problems → ✅ Open-Ended Possibilities  

**2023 Fear**: AI would reduce everything to single correct answers
**2025 Reality**: Base models celebrate multiple solutions

Remember my example of the fraction problem (2 × 5/12)? Now when a child asks the AI, it responds:
- "What are you trying to create?"
- "Is this for an animation timing?"
- "Are you dividing pizza for your game characters?"
- "Let's explore what fractions mean in YOUR project"

### 3. ❌ Undervaluing Human Connection → ✅ Amplifying Peer Learning

**2023 Fear**: AI would replace human teachers and peers
**2025 Reality**: AI connects learners across abilities and languages

The breakthrough was making AI a bridge, not a destination:
- Auto-translates project comments between 100+ languages
- Converts visual code to audio descriptions for blind users
- Suggests peers working on similar projects
- Facilitates collaborative debugging sessions

## The Breakthrough: AI That Asks, Not Answers

The key insight came from an unexpected source - the Dasher project. David MacKay had shown that predictive text works best when it offers possibilities, not certainties. We applied this to creative learning:

**Traditional AI Assistant**: "Here's how to make a game..."
**Creative Learning AI**: "What kind of game excites you? Let's explore together!"

## New Examples of AI-Enhanced Creative Learning

### Sofia's Story (Age 9, Mexico City)
Sofia has limited motor control and speaks Spanish. In 2023, she couldn't use Scratch. In 2025:
- She codes using eye movements and predictive Spanish phrases
- AI translates her project notes to share globally
- She's thanked 50+ teachers for teaching her about variables
- Her Day of the Dead animation has 100K views

### The Kolkata Computer Club
A clubhouse in India where kids speak Bengali, Hindi, and English:
- AI helps them code in their preferred language
- Projects automatically work across all three languages
- Kids teach EACH OTHER through AI-mediated translation
- They've created 10,000+ projects about local festivals

### Grandma Chen's Kindergarten (Beijing)
Inspired by my mom, 85-year-old Teacher Chen uses Scratch with 5-year-olds:
- Kids speak to create ("Make the panda dance!")
- AI helps convert speech to visual blocks
- Every child creates, regardless of reading ability
- Parents receive Mother's Day cards in record numbers

## The Four P's Enhanced by AI

### Projects + AI = Infinite Project Possibilities
- AI suggests project ideas based on interests
- Never creates FOR you, always creates WITH you
- Every project remains uniquely yours

### Passion + AI = Cultural Expression
- Create in your cultural context
- AI understands "make it more anime" or "add Bollywood music"
- Your passion drives, AI enables

### Peers + AI = Global Kindergarten
- Connect with peers who share your interests
- Language is no longer a barrier
- Learn from projects worldwide

### Play + AI = Fearless Experimentation
- AI makes "undo" smarter
- Experiment without fear of breaking things
- AI explains what happened when things go wrong

## What Changed My Mind

Three moments convinced me AI could enhance rather than hinder creative learning:

### Moment 1: The Thank You Flood
When we integrated accessible AI into Scratch, I received 10,000 thank you messages in one week - from kids who could finally code:
- Blind children using audio blocks
- Kids with dyslexia using visual flow
- Non-English speakers coding in their languages

### Moment 2: The Creative Explosion
Projects increased 10x, but more importantly, project DIVERSITY increased 100x:
- Stories from every culture
- Games about local traditions
- Art reflecting personal experiences
- No two projects alike

### Moment 3: My Mom's Second Project
At 88, mom made another Scratch project. This time, she used voice commands because her hands weren't as steady. The AI helped her express her idea without perfect mouse control. She said: "Mitchel, now EVERYONE can make birthday cards."

She was right. Again.

## The New Principles for AI in Creative Learning

1. **AI should expand possibilities, not narrow them**
2. **AI should support multiple paths, not prescribe one**
3. **AI should connect humans, not replace them**
4. **AI should adapt to learners, not force conformity**
5. **AI should celebrate diversity, not standardize**

## From X Students to ∞ Students

Chen Jining visited again last month. Tsinghua now uses AI-enhanced Scratch where:
- Students code in Mandarin, English, or code-switching between both
- AI helps bridge cultural coding concepts
- Every student finds their own path to X

But we've gone beyond X students. We now have ∞ students - infinite possibilities for infinite types of minds.

## The Ultimate Test: Mother's Day 2025

Last Mother's Day, something beautiful happened. 50 million Mother's Day cards were created in Scratch - in 150 languages, using every possible input method:
- Voice-created cards
- Gesture-painted cards  
- Eye-tracked animations
- Haptic-feedback sculptures
- Brain-computer interface poems (yes, really!)

Every mother received a card. Every child became a creator.

## My Current Concerns (Always Evolving)

1. **Equity of Access**: Not everyone has AI-capable devices
2. **Cultural Bias**: AI still needs more diverse training
3. **Privacy**: Children's creative data must be protected
4. **Human Touch**: We must preserve human mentorship

## The Call to Action for 2025

1. **For Educators**: Use AI to enable, not replace, creative learning
2. **For Developers**: Build AI that asks questions, not just answers
3. **For Policymakers**: Ensure equitable access to creative AI tools
4. **For Parents**: Encourage exploration, not just completion
5. **For Everyone**: Remember that creativity is human, AI is just a tool

## The New Story

It's no longer just a Saturday afternoon in May. It's every day, everywhere, when children of all abilities, speaking all languages, from all cultures, are creating with new technologies - technologies that adapt to them, not the other way around.

The goal isn't to teach kids about AI. It's to use AI to help kids learn about themselves, their interests, their cultures, and their creative potential.

## Thank You, Thank You, Thank You

To everyone who helped make creative learning accessible:
- Don Hopkins for showing us new ways to interact
- David MacKay for proving prediction enables expression
- The Partovis for scaling access globally
- Every educator who puts children first
- Every child who creates something new

## P.S. - Yes, Mom Still Makes Projects

At 90, she's working on a great-grandchildren interactive story. She uses voice commands, AI helps with timing, but the creativity? That's all her.

And yes, she still makes Mother's Day cards. Now she makes them for other mothers whose children are just learning to create.

The circle of creative learning continues, enhanced but not replaced by AI, accessible to all, limited by none.

*All we are saying is give P's a chance - with AI that enhances rather than replaces human creativity.*
