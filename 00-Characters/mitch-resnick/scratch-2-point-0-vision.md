# Scratch 2.0: Bringing Creation and Sharing Together
*From Mitchel Resnick's 2013 Scratch Conference Interview at Citilab*

## The Vision: Everyone Can Create

"With Scratch, it's possible for everyone - literally everyone - to create their own interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations," Mitch explained, his gentle enthusiasm evident even in the conference hallway.

"Computer programming has been seen as something only for people with lots of background in mathematics and technology. Scratch opens the door for everyone to express their ideas with computers."

## The Big Change: Two Worlds Become One

### Scratch 1.0 (2007-2013)
- Programming environment on your local machine
- Online community as separate website
- Upload projects after creating them
- "People had to go back and forth between two worlds"

### Scratch 2.0 (2013)
- Create directly in the web browser
- See and modify others' code instantly
- "The two worlds come together"

## The Power of Instant Remixing

"If you see someone else's project online, you can see the scripts right there and start experimenting with their programming blocks, making changes and trying new things."

This wasn't just a technical upgrade - it was philosophical:
- Lower barriers to collaboration
- Immediate experimentation
- Learning through remixing becomes seamless

## Examples of Creative Expression

Mitch's eyes lit up describing the diversity:
- "Interactive birthday cards for friends"
- "Public service announcements for communities"  
- "Games for younger siblings"
- "Whatever's in their imagination"

## The Extension Revolution

"We want Scratch to meet the interests and passions of everyone."

The community was already stretching Scratch beyond the screen:
- **Microsoft Kinect**: Control projects with body movement
- **LEGO Robotics**: Program physical robots
- **Arduino**: Connect to electronics and sensors

"We've been following the Scratch for Arduino effort because it opens up new possibilities for people to join the online world with the physical world."

## Looking Forward: HTML5 and Beyond

"We're starting to work on a version implemented in HTML5 and JavaScript, which is becoming a standard."

The goals:
1. Run Scratch everywhere (phones, tablets, anything with a browser)
2. Make extensions easier for developers
3. Let communities add their own blocks
4. "Groups like Scratch for Arduino could make extensions"

## The Family Gathering

At the 2013 conference, Mitch described the feeling:

"It's somewhat like a family gathering for us. It's great to see people doing exciting things with Scratch. We always learn so much when we meet with people in the Scratch community."

The Citilab facility impressed him: "A beautiful facility... a great venue for bringing together the imaginative, creative members of the Scratch community."

## The Deeper Purpose

Beyond the technology, Mitch emphasized the human element:

"People can use computers now to create whatever's in their imagination... have their voice be heard through their creations and share them with others."

Whether creating for:
- Personal expression
- Community connection
- Educational purposes
- Pure joy of creation

The tool adapts to the creator's needs.

## The Ultimate Goal

"In the future, I hope that whenever anybody wants to create something dynamic and interactive with new technologies, they'll think of turning to Scratch."

Not limited to:
- Desktop computers
- Specific age groups
- Particular subjects
- One type of project

But available for:
- "Whatever they want"
- "Wherever they want"
- "Whenever they want"
- "With new technologies"

## Six Years Later: The Results

By 2013, Scratch had evolved from an experiment to a movement:
- Millions of users worldwide
- Conferences bringing together global community
- Extensions connecting digital and physical
- A new generation thinking creatively with technology

As Mitch noted: "We first introduced Scratch six years ago... now people can create their Scratch projects directly in the web browser."

The journey from desktop software to global creative platform was complete. But for Mitch, this was just the beginning.
