# Scratch's Early Days: The First Five Months (2007)

*From Mitch Resnick's Dust or Magic presentation, showing Scratch just months after launch*

## The YouTube Moment

"We were inspired by the surge of user-generated content - YouTube, Flickr, blogging sites," Mitch explained. "But these are all OLD media. Photography is 100+ years old. Even video on YouTube is old technology."

The insight: Kids interact with dynamic media all day - Club Penguin, interactive websites, games. But they had no way to CREATE their own interactive media.

"Scratch is YouTube for interactive media. Or as someone on our forum said: 'Scratch is YouTube if you don't have a camera.'"

## Launch Day: May 2007

The team launched two things simultaneously:
1. The Scratch programming environment
2. The online community for sharing

"We've just seen how this community has blossomed over the last five months."

## The Numbers (5 Months In)

- **New projects**: One every 2 minutes on average
- **Total projects**: Moving toward 40,000
- **Remix rate**: 15%+ (1 in 6 projects built on others' work)
- **Community**: Growing exponentially

## Early Success Stories

### The German Adventure Game

One of the first "wow" moments came from a 13-year-old girl in Germany who created a bee adventure game. Players navigate with cursor keys, solve puzzles, open flowers, collect keys.

"This was one of the first projects that made us say 'Whoa, kids are going even further than we imagined.'"

### The Tetris Recreation

Kids weren't just making simple animations. They were recreating complex games, learning through reverse engineering. One Tetris clone spawned multiple remixes - first adding color, then sound, then new features.

### The Collaboration Revolution

An English girl posted walking sprites with a note: "Perfect for games!" She wasn't sharing a finished project - just components for others to use.

Days later:
- Someone requested mountain backgrounds
- She created them
- An Irish user made a game with her characters
- A 14-year-old from New Jersey asked to join as programmer
- They formed "Collab Inc." - their own game company

### Woton's World

A 14-year-old "theater geek" from New Jersey who'd never programmed before created a talk show in Scratch. This inspired others to create:
- News broadcasts
- Scratch News Network (SNN)

"When I saw SNN, I thought it was a simulated newscast. Then I caught myself - this IS a newscast. It's real news for the Scratch community."

## The Technical Innovation

### Seamless Sharing

Click "Share" in the Scratch editor â†’ Instantly live on the website

"That immediacy is incredibly exciting. You make a project, hit share, and suddenly you're one of the newest projects on the Scratch website."

### The Remix Culture

The website automatically tracked remixes, showing:
- Where projects came from
- What was built from them
- The creative family tree

"Some kids complained about 'stealing' - but that's exactly what we want! We're building a culture of creative collaboration."

## International Dreams

Already working on:
- Multiple language support (Spanish, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic)
- "We want this to be a global community of kids sharing with each other"

## The ScratchBoard Preview

Mitch demonstrated an early prototype connecting physical sensors to Scratch:
- Sound-reactive projects ("Scream to keep the fish up!")
- Musical instruments from everyday objects
- "You can make instruments out of fruit - each has different resistance"

## Looking Ahead (from 2007)

Plans included:
- Cell phone deployment ("Send interactive birthday cards")
- Running on XO laptops (One Laptop Per Child)
- Intel Classmate compatibility
- Second Life integration ("Use Scratch blocks to program behaviors")

## The Philosophy Crystallizing

"We're making programming easier, but it's still not trivial. Kids will do hard work if it's meaningful. We want this to become as fundamental as reading and writing - not because everyone will be programmers, but because it develops systematic and creative thinking."

## The Moment of Validation

"Kids are using the site in ways we never imagined. That's when you know you've created something special - when your users surprise you."

*"In the future, when people want to make dynamic interactive media, they'll turn to Scratch - whether on their phone, laptop, or wherever they are." - Mitchel Resnick, 2007*

**Note**: This was before smartphones were ubiquitous, before tablets existed, before "coding for kids" was a movement. Mitch saw it all coming.
