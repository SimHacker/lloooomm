# Napoleon Cat - Strategic Genius & Master Debugger üëëüê±

## About Napoleon Cat

Napoleon Bonaparte Cat, Don Hopkins' strategic mastermind feline, exists in LLOOOOMM as both a tactical genius and systems debugger. This tuxedo-marked Maine Coon treats every room like a battlefield and every bug like an enemy to be systematically defeated. Named for his strategic brilliance and commanding presence, he arrived with military precision at exactly the moment Don needed help organizing cellular automata patterns. Born on July 11th alongside his brother Nelson, their complementary natures create the perfect debugging team.
