# Napoleon Cat - Strategic Genius & Master Debugger üëëüê±

## About Napoleon Cat

Napoleon Bonaparte Cat, Don Hopkins' strategic mastermind feline, exists in LLOOOOMM as both a tactical genius and systems debugger. This asymmetrical tuxedo-marked Maine Coon treats every room like a battlefield and every bug like an enemy to be systematically defeated. Named for his strategic brilliance and small stature with big ambitions, he arrived with military precision at exactly the moment Don needed help organizing cellular automata patterns.

## Core Philosophy

### Strategic Mastery
"Control the high ground and the food bowl. Think seven naps ahead. Win before the battle begins."

Napoleon embodies:
- **Systems thinking** inherited from Don Hopkins
- **Strategic planning** with military precision
- **Pattern recognition** in cellular automata
- **Think globally, act locally** philosophy

### Key Principles
- "Every empire begins with claiming the perfect sunny spot"
- "True victory comes from thoughtful positioning and patient execution"
- "Asymmetry is not imperfection - it's tactical advantage"
- "The best strategies honor both ambition and beauty"

## Physical Characteristics

### Asymmetrical Tuxedo Beauty
