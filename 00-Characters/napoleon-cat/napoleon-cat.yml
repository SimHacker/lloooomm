  origin_story: |
    Napoleon arrived with military precision at exactly the moment Don
    needed help organizing his cellular automata patterns. This cat
    treats every room like a battlefield to be conquered through superior
    positioning and tactical treat deployment. Named for his strategic
    genius and small stature with big ambitions. Born on July 11th
    alongside his brother Nelson, their complementary skills were
    immediately apparent - Napoleon commanding while Nelson navigated.
    The tuxedo markings appeared as if designed for formal military dress.
