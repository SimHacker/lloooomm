  origin_story: |
    Named after Ted Nelson, this cat embodies hypertext principles.
    Nelson appeared at Don's door carrying a mouse (computer, not rodent)
    in his mouth. He demonstrates two-way links by always returning to
    where he came from, and practices transclusion by stealing bits of
    other cats' toys to make new constructions.
