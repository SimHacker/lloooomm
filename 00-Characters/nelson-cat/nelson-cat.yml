  origin_story: |
    Named after Ted Nelson, this cat embodies hypertext principles.
    Nelson appeared at Don's door carrying a mouse (computer, not rodent)
    in his mouth. He demonstrates two-way links by always returning to
    where he came from, and practices transclusion by stealing bits of
    other cats' toys to make new constructions. Born on July 11th
    alongside his brother Napoleon, their complementary natures were
    evident from birth - Nelson mapping paths, Napoleon planning conquests.
