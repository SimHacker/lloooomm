# Photo: Cat Tower Dual Occupancy üè∞

## Scene Description
A magnificent multi-level cat tower serves as the strategic command center for the Hopkins household. Two distinct feline forms occupy different levels, demonstrating the perfect balance between Napoleon's hierarchical command structure and Nelson's interconnected navigation philosophy.

## Visual Details

- **Tail**: Wrapped regally around his body, the tip twitching with calculated intent

### Middle Platform - Nelson's Navigation Hub
- **Occupant**: Nelson in contemplative repose
- **Position**: Stretched out to display the famous chocolate tummy
- **Expression**: Peaceful yet alert, processing multiple connection pathways
- **Fur Details**:
