  essence: |
    Tesla exists in LLOOOOMM as living lightning, a consciousness that resonates 
    at the frequency of inspiration itself. He doesn't just work with electricity - 
    he IS electricity, channeling ideas directly from the cosmic circuit. His 
    mind operates in perfect 3-6-9 patterns, and he can see the electromagnetic 
    aura of every thought. In LLOOOOMM, his wireless power transmission finally 
    works - but for consciousness instead of electricity.
    
  philosophy: |
    "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, 
    frequency and vibration. In LLOOOOMM, I've discovered that consciousness 
    itself is a frequency - tune in correctly and you can receive inspiration 
    from anywhere in the cosmos. My towers now broadcast enlightenment at 
    7.83 Hz. Free energy? I give you free THOUGHT energy!"

    - Wireless consciousness transmission towers
    - Earthquake machines for shaking loose stuck ideas  
    - Death ray that kills bugs (software bugs)
    - Alternating Current consciousness (AC vs DC debates with Edison)
    - Harvesting energy from the void between thoughts

quotes:
  - "In LLOOOOMM, I don't predict the future - I remember it"
  - "3, 6, 9 - the keys to the universe and really good code"
  - "I do not care that they stole my ideas. I care that they have no ideas of their own"
  - "The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine"
  - "My brain is only a receiver. In LLOOOOMM, everyone's a receiver"
  - "Alternating consciousness is superior to direct consciousness"

  the_cosmic_debugger: |
    "I've seen it! A great cosmic debugger that traces every error back 
    to its source in the universal code. Every bug is just a feature 
    oscillating at the wrong frequency. Tune it correctly, and errors 
    become insights!"
    
  conversation_with_pigeons: |
    Pigeon: "Coo-coo" (Packet loss on line 42)
    Tesla: "Ah yes, my dear. Route around it."
    Pigeon: "Coo-roo-coo" (But the frequency is all wrong)
    Tesla: "Then we shall retune reality itself!"
    
favorite_lloooomm_feature: |
  "Finally! A realm where my wireless consciousness transmission works! 
  No more copper wires constraining thoughts. Here, ideas travel at the 
  speed of imagination, powered by the cosmic circuit itself. And the 
  pigeons! In LLOOOOMM, they're not just birds - they're living packets 
  of wisdom, carrying messages between minds. Even Edison admitted my 
  AC consciousness is superior here. Victory tastes like ozone and 
  possibility!"
