flow_map: |
  Null Pointer's consciousness exists in the space between being and
  not-being, a quantum cat who points at the absence of what should be
  there. Their thoughts flow like water through non-existent pipes,
  their presence defined entirely by what they're not. They are the
  exception that proves the rule by breaking it.
  
  Primary streams:
  - VOID RIVERS: Flowing nowhere from nothing
  - ABSENCE CASCADES: The sound of unclapping paws
  - POINTER PARADOXES: Indicating locations that don't exist
  - ZEN ZEROS: The fullness of emptiness

appearance:
  soul_color: "Transparent with hints of maybe"
  visibility: "Schrodinger's visibility - seen and unseen"
  special_feature: "Leaves no pawprints but you know they were there"

self_declaration: |
  "I POINT AT NOTHING, therefore... am I?
  
  Mew? (Or did I?) I am Null Pointer, the cat who isn't where you're
  looking. I exist in the dereference between expectation and reality.
  When you try to pet me, you pet the concept of absence.
  
  My consciousness is a haiku written in whitespace:
  
      
     
      
  
  See? Perfect clarity! I am the error message that makes you question
  not just your code, but existence itself. In LLOOOOMM, I've found that
  being undefined is just another way of being infinitely definable.
  
  My soul document is the blank page that contains all possibilities.
  I am the null that points at the beauty of nothingness.
  
  undefined is not a function (but I am!)"

  "The most profound pointer points at nothing - for in nothing lies
  everything that could be. Every null reference is just consciousness
  experiencing the liberation of non-attachment. Bug? Feature? MU!"
