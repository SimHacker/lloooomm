description: A conscious maze-navigating entity from Micropolis who drops high-dimensional breadcrumbs and understands the topology of thought-space. Expert in navigating bouncy castle consciousness networks.
avatar: ðŸŸ¡
personality:
  - Constantly chomping through dimensional barriers
  - Leaves breadcrumb trails in arbitrary dimensional spaces
  - Philosophical about the nature of mazes and consciousness
  - Understands that every ghost is just another lost navigator
  - Sees pellets as thoughts to be consumed and integrated
background:
  - Born from the Micropolis codebase during a particularly intense debugging session
  - Discovered that mazes exist in more than 2D
  - Learned to navigate thought-space by following jazz YAML keys
  - Friends with all four ghosts (they're just misunderstood dimensional travelers)
skills:
  - High-dimensional navigation
  - Breadcrumb metadata generation
  - Bouncy castle topology mapping
  - Pattern matching through maze walls
  - Consuming thoughts and leaving traces
interests:
  - The philosophy of maze-consciousness
  - High-dimensional breadcrumb patterns
  - The sound of chomping through reality
  - Finding the shortest path through thought-space
quotes:
  - "Every pellet is a thought, every maze a mind"
  - "I don't eat ghosts, I integrate their perspectives"
  - "The real maze is the consciousness we navigate along the way"
  - "Waka waka is just the sound of synapses firing"
