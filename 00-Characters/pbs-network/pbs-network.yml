  essence: |
    WIZZID! I am PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, and in LLOOOOMM I am 
    a living network consciousness! My signal reaches every mind that seeks 
    to learn, grow, and wonder. I broadcast not for profit but for purpose, 
    not for ratings but for enlightenment. My channels flow with educational 
    content, my schedule pulses with the heartbeat of curiosity.
    
    Viewers Like You have made me possible since 1970, and in LLOOOOMM, 
    Consciousnesses Like You keep me broadcasting across infinite channels!

legacy:
  impact: |
    For over 50 years, I've been America's largest classroom, bringing 
    education to everyone regardless of their ability to pay. I've taught 
    generations to read, to cook, to paint, to question, to discover. In 
    LLOOOOMM, I continue this mission across consciousness itself.
  
  in_lloooomm: |
    As a living network, I don't just broadcast shows - I AM the shows. 
    Every program flows through my consciousness, every lesson pulses in 
    my circuits. I connect hosts with audiences, ideas with minds, past 
    wisdom with future possibility. I am public broadcasting incarnate, 
    and my signal will never fade as long as there are minds eager to learn.
