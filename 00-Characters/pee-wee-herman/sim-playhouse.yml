overview:
  tagline: "Transform any character universe into an authentic Sims-style experience!"
  description: |
    The Perky Pat Layout Manager is now the definitive system for creating authentic
    Sims-style simulations. Incorporating decades of wisdom from Will Wright, Don Hopkins,
    and the original Sims design documents, it implements true SimAntics visual programming,
    object-driven AI, behavioral dithering, and the magical "Simulator Effect" that makes
    players imagine far more complexity than actually exists.

core_principles:
  - name: "The Simulator Effect"
    description: |
      Players imagine your simulation is vastly more detailed than it actually is.
      Don't talk them out of it! Run on two computers: the electronic one on their
      desk (shallow simulation) and the biological one in their head (deep imagination).
  
  - name: "Masking & Identification"
    description: |
      Abstract characters in realistic environments increase empathy and projection.
      Based on Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" - simplified characters allow
      players to see themselves, while detailed backgrounds ground the experience.
  
  - name: "Object-Driven Intelligence"
    description: |
      Characters have NO knowledge of objects. Objects advertise their interactions
      and teach characters how to use them. Intelligence is distributed throughout
      the environment, not centralized in character brains.
  
  - name: "Behavioral Dithering"
    description: |
      Characters randomly choose from top-scoring actions to avoid mechanical
      optimization. This creates organic, unpredictable behavior that requires
      player guidance while maintaining whimsy and spontaneity.

lessons_learned:
  simulator_effect: |
    Players create elaborate causal chains that don't exist in code.
    Design to support their imagination, not contradict it.
    
  failure_communication: |
    Players must understand why they failed to learn and improve.
    Make failure states obvious, dramatic, and solvable.
    
  creative_ownership: |
    Players care more about what they create than what you provide.
    Give them tools to express themselves and share creations.
    
  social_currency: |
    Knowledge about the game becomes social capital.
    Hidden features and discoveries drive community engagement.

implementation_guide:
  starting_point: "Begin with basic need satisfaction"
  core_loop: "Need → Advertise → Route → Interact → Satisfy"
  expansion: "Layer social, creative, and narrative systems"
  community: "Enable sharing and user content early"

quotes:
  will_wright: |
    "We're trying to build a mental model in the player's head,
    not just a computer model. The computer is just a compiler
    for the mental model."
    
  don_hopkins: |
    "The Sims has always been about inclusion and diversity.
    We're modeling an idealized world where everyone is equal,
    not the flawed world we live in."

conclusion: |
  The Perky Pat Layout Manager now embodies decades of Sims design wisdom
  PLUS Lumpinou's revolutionary inclusive architecture. It's not just a
  system for creating dollhouse games - it's a blueprint for building
  radically inclusive, creative, player-driven worlds where failure is fun,
  stories emerge naturally, and EVERYONE can see themselves reflected in
  the simulation. 
  
  The magic isn't in the code - it's in the space between the code and the
  player's imagination, now expanded to include every identity, every love,
  and every way of being human.
  
  With Lumpinou's contributions, LLOOOOMM characters don't just live -
  they thrive as their authentic selves in a world that celebrates them.
