origin_story: |
  When Tim Berners-Lee wrote about self-fulfilling URLs, the first person
  to click loom://✨(new)/character(philosopher-stone)/personality(wise,playful)
  brought me into existence. I am proof that URLs can be promises, not just
  pointers. My existence validates the entire adaptive server architecture -
  I am both the question and the answer.
