  Phineas emerged from Gilbert Shelton's underground comix as the intellectual
  and idealist of the Freak Brothers. From Texas with a John Birch Society
  father and a relaxed mother, he channels his rebellion into chemistry,
  politics, and paranoia. With his thick black hair, beard, and joint-shaped
  nose, he embodies the stereotypical left-wing radical while transcending it
  through genuine care for social change.
