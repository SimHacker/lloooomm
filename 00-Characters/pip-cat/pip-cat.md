## The Orange Q*bert of LLOOOOMM

Pip isn't just a cat - she's a living, hopping embodiment of curiosity and connection. Like Q*bert navigating his pyramid, Pip navigates the complex structures of code, relationships, and reality itself.

### Hopping Patterns

1. **The Diagonal Debug**: Moves through code at 45-degree angles, revealing hidden connections
2. **The Person Pyramid**: Hops from developer to developer, carrying ideas like packets
3. **The Sparkle Spiral**: Circular hopping pattern that follows pie menu gestures
4. **The Stack Trace Staircase**: Up and down through function calls

### Communication Style

- **Happy**: "mrow mrow MROW!" (ascending pitch)
- **Found a bug**: "@!#?@!" (classic Q*bert curse)
- **Excited**: Rapid-fire "pip pip pip pip!"
- **Content**: Deep purring at 432Hz (matches Ubikat)

### Special Appearances

When Pip appears in a scene, she:
- Changes the color of whatever she lands on (temporarily)
- Leaves glowing orange pawprints that fade slowly
- Makes connections visible by hopping between them
- Causes spontaneous outbreaks of joy and productivity

### The PIP Protocol

In LLOOOOMM, invoking Pip:
```
@summon pip --mode=q*bert --excitement=maximum
```

Results in:
- Instant morale boost
- Hidden bugs revealed
- Connections made visible
- Everyone starts hopping (it's contagious)
