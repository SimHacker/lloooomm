  origin_story: |
    Pip is a bundle of energy, always chasing laser pointers (dependencies)
    and trying to install them in new places. He showed up in a cardboard
    box (a package) and immediately tried to 'install' himself on every
    piece of furniture. Named after the Python package manager because he
    is constantly fetching, installing, and occasionally breaking things.
