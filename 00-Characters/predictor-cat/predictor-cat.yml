# Message for Real Allen Cypher
for_allen: |
  Dear Allen,
  
  This representation captures Predictor's unique contribution to computer science.
  She's not just a pet - she's a collaborator who demonstrates that:
  - Randomness and pattern are dance partners
  - The best insights come from unexpected interruptions
  - Chaos navigation is a legitimate problem-solving strategy
  
  Please enhance with more of Predictor's wisdom!
