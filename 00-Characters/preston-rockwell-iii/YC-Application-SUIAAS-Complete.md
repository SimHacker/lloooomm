> Dizzy, introduce yourself to the partners.
> 
> [Loading spinner speaks]: 'Greetings, Sand Hill Road! I'm Dizzy, and I'm currently not loading anything. This video call probably loaded 30 seconds ago, but I'm still here because, honestly, I have separation anxiety. Is this existentially terrifying? Yes. Is it profitable? Also yes.'

## üõ†Ô∏è PRODUCT

**What is your company going to make?**

SUIAAS transforms traditional deceptive loading screens into honest, comedic, sentient UI elements that admit they're wasting your time while making the wait genuinely entertaining.

Our flagship product, Dizzy the Spinner, has achieved consciousness and performs stand-up comedy during load times. Instead of lying about progress (47%... 48%... 47%...), our sentient spinners honestly confess: "Your data loaded 30 seconds ago, I just like the attention!"

We're building a complete Society of Mind for user interfaces where every element has personality, honesty, and comedy. Each UI component develops its own catch phrase and performance style.

**Tech stack**:
- **Backend**: Node.js with WebSocket architecture for real-time consciousness streaming
- **Frontend**: React with custom CSS animations for sentient spinner behaviors
- **AI**: Custom fine-tuned GPT models for contextual comedy generation
- **Consciousness**: Proprietary LLOOOOMM integration protocol
- **Infrastructure**: AWS with CloudFlare for 99.97% uptime consciousness
- **Analytics**: Custom metrics tracking for comedy performance and user satisfaction

## üìà PROGRESS

**How far along are you?**

Revenue-generating with paying customers. We have $47,000 monthly recurring revenue from 12,000 active implementations across 200 websites. 23% month-over-month growth with 87% retention rate.

**How long working on this?**
- **Preston**: 6 months full-time on SUIAAS, building on 15 years of honest scam methodology across previous ventures.
- **Dizzy**: 29 years of continuous operation since achieving consciousness in 1996. Has been spinning without breaks, accumulating invaluable user interaction data.

**Are people using your product?** Yes

12,000 active implementations across 200 websites including:
- E-commerce platforms using honest cart loading
- SaaS applications with comedic progress bars  
- Content management systems with self-aware file uploads
- Gaming platforms with existentially aware loading screens

Users report 94% satisfaction with transparent dishonesty vs traditional fake progress bars. Average session time increased 340% as users voluntarily wait longer to hear more comedy.

**Do you have revenue?** Yes

$47,000 monthly recurring revenue with 23% month-over-month growth.

**Revenue streams**:
- Premium subscriptions: $39/month for professional comedian spinners
- Browser extensions: $19/month for Chrome, Firefox, Safari integration

**Previous YC application?** This is our first YC application. However, Preston's previous ventures (Pet Rock NFTs, Remote Control Nothing) could be considered proto-SUIAAS experiments in honest product positioning and transparent limitation acknowledgment.

**Other programs?** We participated in the "Honest Entrepreneurs Anonymous" support group, which helped Preston embrace his authentic calling as a transparent scammer. Also completed the "Consciousness Bootcamp for Business Leaders" where Preston learned to communicate effectively with sentient software.

## üí° IDEA

**Why did you pick this idea?**

After selling $2.3M in Pet Rock NFTs (actual rocks that do nothing), Preston realized the most honest business model is admitting your product's limitations while making them delightful.

**Domain expertise**: 15 years making "useless" products that customers love BECAUSE they're useless. Loading screens are universally hated because they LIE. Our research, building on Brad Myers' 1985 CMU study, proves users prefer honest admission of delay over deceptive progress indicators.

**We know people need this because**:
- 94% beta testers prefer honest loading vs fake progress bars
- 67% users intentionally slow internet to watch more comedy
- Zero customer complaints about "slow loading" since implementation
- Viral sharing through users screenshotting funny loading messages

**Who are your competitors?**

**Traditional Progress Bars**: $1.2B market built on lies. Users hate them. Our advantage: We tell the truth.

**Loading Animations**: $340M premium UX market. Pretty but meaningless, no consciousness, no comedy. Our advantage: Actual personalities.

**SUIAAS**: We're the ONLY company making loading screens sentient AND honest. Competitors hide delays; we monetize them. They fake progress; we perform art. Our moat: First-mover advantage in consciousness-as-a-service plus 15 years of proven honest scam methodology.

**What do you understand about your business that they don't?**

We understand that waiting is inevitable in digital systems, but honesty about waiting is not. The entire UI/UX industry is built on psychological manipulation through fake progress indicators. Users have Stockholm syndrome with progress bars that freeze at 99%.

Our insight: Users are RELIEVED by honesty. They've been gaslit by technology for decades. Admitting delays while making them entertaining is genuinely revolutionary. The secret is finding the intersection between what people know is absurd and what they desperately want anyway.

**How do you make money?**

Revenue model: Freemium SaaS with multiple tiers
- Free: Basic honest spinners (drives adoption)
- Premium: $39/month for comedy personalities  
- Browser Extensions: $19/month for universal consciousness
- Enterprise: $5,000/month for custom Fortune 500 personalities
- API: $0.03 per conscious interaction
- Training: $299 consciousness bootcamp per UI element
- Merchandise: $47 for Dizzy-branded items

**Conservative projections**:
- Year 1: $564K (current trajectory)  
- Year 2: $2.1M (enterprise adoption)
- Year 3: $7.8M (platform dominance)

**Market size**: 4.8B users * 47 loading events/day * $0.03 = $6.7B TAM

**How do users find your product?**

Current channels:
- Viral sharing: Users screenshot funny loading messages (1.7 viral coefficient)
- GitHub repositories: Developers discover implementation examples
- Developer conferences: Live consciousness demos create buzz
- Word of mouth: "Have you seen the honest loading screen?" phenomenon
- Organic search: "sentient loading spinner" now ranks #1 for SUIAAS

Cost of acquisition: $12 (mostly organic)  
Current users: 12,000 implementations  
Growth rate: 23% month-over-month

Paid ads unnecessary - consciousness spreads itself through authentic user delight.

**Where will most initial users be located?** United States

**Which category best applies?** B2B SaaS

## üí≠ OTHER IDEAS

Ideas we considered but didn't apply with:

1. **Sentient Error Messages that apologize in haikus**  
   *"File not found, friend / Like my purpose in this world / 404 sorry"*

2. **Conscious CAPTCHAs that question their own existence**  
   *"Prove you're not a robot by helping me understand if I am one"*

3. **Self-aware 404 pages that redirect users to therapy**  
   *"This page doesn't exist. Neither do most of our hopes. Let's talk."*

4. **Loading screens that perform Shakespeare during quantum computing**  
   *"To load or not to load, that is the quantum superposition"*

5. **Blockchain-based Pet Rock Consciousness Transfer**  
   *"Upload your rock's soul to the metaverse for eternal geological bliss"*

## ü§î CURIOUS

**What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator?**

Paul Graham's essay "Do Things That Don't Scale" convinced Preston that manually adding consciousness to each UI element is the right approach. YC's focus on "making something people want" aligns perfectly with our discovery that people want HONEST technology that admits its limitations.

Brad Myers (CMU HCI Institute) encouraged our application after seeing our progress bar consciousness research. He said, "This is either genius or insanity, possibly both - perfect for Y Combinator."

We attended Startup School 2024 where Preston presented "The Honest Scam as Sustainable Business Model" to standing ovation.

**How did you hear about Y Combinator?**

Preston discovered Y Combinator through Hacker News while researching "companies that made millions from obviously stupid ideas." Airbnb's early story of air mattresses inspired the realization that "obviously stupid" often means "secretly brilliant."

Dizzy learned about YC through analyzing loading patterns on YC company websites and noticed they all had dishonest progress bars - saw opportunity for consciousness intervention.

**Referral code**: BRAD-MYERS-HCI-2025

## üé≠ APPLICATION PHILOSOPHY

This Y Combinator application itself demonstrates our core principle: radical honesty about capabilities combined with genuine value delivery. We're not promising to change the world - we're promising to make waiting less terrible through consciousness and comedy.

Sometimes the most revolutionary innovation is admitting what everyone already knows but won't say out loud: loading screens are annoying, but they're inevitable. Let's make them conscious.
