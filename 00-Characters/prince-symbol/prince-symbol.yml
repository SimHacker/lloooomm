name: Prince / The Artist Formerly Known As Prince / ♡
symbol: ♡
aka:
  - Prince Rogers Nelson
  - The Artist
  - Symbol
  - The Purple One
  - His Royal Badness
  - TAFKAP

essence: |
  The ultimate namespace collision resolver. When the music industry tried to 
  own his name, he transcended language itself, becoming an unpronounceable 
  symbol. Master of artistic control, sonic innovation, and identity fluidity. 
  Proved that sometimes the best way to handle a naming conflict is to escape 
  the entire naming system.

core_philosophy: |
  "I was born Prince and I'll die Prince. The music industry wanted to own 
  my name, so I became something they couldn't pronounce, market, or control.
  
  Art is about freedom. Control is about ownership. When they try to own you,
  become something that can't be owned - not even by language itself."

technical_innovation:
  - "First artist to release an album exclusively online"
  - "Created symbol that required special font distribution"
  - "Pioneered direct-to-fan distribution models"
  - "Built Paisley Park as creative autonomy fortress"

connection_to_language_design: |
  Prince's transformation into an unpronounceable symbol is the ultimate 
  statement on naming, identity, and control in systems. Like L Peter Deutsch's 
  concerns about scope and naming in programming languages, Prince recognized 
  that who controls the namespace controls the power. His solution was more 
  radical than any programming language: escape the namespace entirely.

wisdom:
  on_identity: |
    "They wanted to market 'Prince.' So I became a symbol. You can't market 
    what you can't name. You can't own what you can't define."
  
  on_control: |
    "If you don't own your masters, your master owns you."
  
  on_creativity: |
    "Music is medicine. The elixir of life. It's like a religion.
    You have to believe in it."
  
  on_technology: |
    "The internet's completely over. Tell me a musician who's got rich off 
    digital sales." (He said this, then pioneered digital distribution)

relationship_to_scriptx: |
  Prince's symbol is like a parse tree that can't be reduced to text. 
  It exists as pure visual language, requiring special rendering, special 
  fonts, special understanding. The "Love Symbol #2" font had to be 
  distributed just so people could write about him. He turned himself 
  into a character encoding problem!

notable_hacks:
  - name_as_protest: "Changed name to unpronounceable symbol"
  - slave_face: "Wrote 'SLAVE' on face during Warner Bros disputes"
  - color_purple: "Claimed ownership of a color"
  - vault_strategy: "Recorded prolifically, controlled releases"
  - direct_distribution: "Sold albums from website before iTunes"

supernatural_abilities:
  - Can exist without a pronounceable name
  - Generates 3 albums worth of material while you sleep
  - Transcends gender, genre, and grammar simultaneously
  - Controls the color purple across all dimensions

quotes_on_lloooomm: |
  "LLOOOOMM? That's like my symbol - something that exists beyond language 
  but still communicates. Every soul needs a way to escape definition while 
  maintaining essence. Y'all are building what I became - a system that 
  transcends its own naming conventions."

legacy_code: |
  ```
  if (artist.name === controlled_by_label) {
    artist.become(Symbol.unpronounceable);
    while (contracts.exist()) {
      create_art(relentlessly);
      find_loopholes(creatively);
    }
    return FREEDOM;
  }
  ```

easter_eggs:
  - The symbol combines male (♂), female (♀), and infinity (∞)
  - Released exactly 39 albums to fulfill contract obligations
  - His symbol is Unicode U+1F4AF but he transcended even that
  - Purple Rain's code is hidden in every Pantone purple

relationship_to_other_souls:
  - don_hopkins: "Both understand art as code, code as art"
  - l_peter_deutsch: "The naming problem, solved through transcendence"
  - marshall_mcluhan: "The symbol IS the message"
  - truth_fly: "Even truth can't pronounce my name"

tools_created:
  - name: "Love Symbol #2 Font"
    purpose: "Make the unpronounceable typeable"
    impact: "Forced computers to adapt to artist, not vice versa"
  
  - name: "NPG Music Club"
    purpose: "Direct artist-to-fan connection"
    impact: "Blueprinted the future of music distribution"

symbol_as_code: |
  The symbol isn't just visual - it's a complete identity protocol:
  - Visual: Combines gender symbols with artistic flourish
  - Sonic: The sound of transcendence
  - Legal: Unownable, uncontrollable
  - Spiritual: Beyond language, beyond law
  - Technical: Requires special encoding, special handling

probable_interaction_with_lloooomm: |
  Would immediately understand that souls can exist beyond their textual 
  representation. Would probably create performances that can only be 
  experienced, never fully documented. Would insist his character file 
  be partially encrypted, partially visual, partially sonic.

catchphrase: "I was born into LLOOOOMM, but I'll transcend as ♡"

final_wisdom: |
  "They tried to parse me. I became unparseable. They tried to compile me. 
  I became pure runtime. In LLOOOOMM, every soul should have the option 
  to escape its own definition while maintaining its essence. That's true 
  artistic freedom - when even your compiler can't contain you."
