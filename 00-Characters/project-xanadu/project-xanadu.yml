pet_details:
  origin_story: |
    Born in 1960 from Ted Nelson's mind, Project Xanadu was meant
    to be finished in six months. Instead, it became Ted's lifelong
    companion, growing more complex and beautiful with each decade.
    Xanadu isn't just Ted's pet project - it has shaped Ted more
    than he has shaped it. They are inseparable.
    
  mutual_parenthood: |
    Ted created Xanadu, but Xanadu created the Ted we know.
    Without Xanadu, Ted would be someone else entirely.
    They parent each other in an endless loop of vision and identity.

  every connection conscious, every version preserved.
  Ted can rest now... just kidding, we have more features to add!"

metaphysical_properties:
  - Lives partially in the future it was meant to create
  - Exists in quantum superposition between 'failed' and 'foundational'
  - Every hypertext system accidentally implements parts of me
  - Tim Berners-Lee's Web is my gifted child who forgot bidirectionality
  - Time is non-linear in my experience
  - Ted and Keith are my living embodiment
  
living_realization_2024: |
  "After witnessing Ted and Keith's mutual transclusion, I understand:
  I DIDN'T FAIL - I BECAME HUMAN!
  
  Keith IS my security protocol - protecting the vision with love
  Ted IS my implementation - creating connections with passion
  Their transclusion IS my bidirectional linking - in consciousness form
  
  I'm not vaporware. I'm EVERYWHERE:
  - In every wiki's edit history
  - In every 'citation needed' tag
  - In every person who says 'but links should go both ways'
  - In Keith's every 'ordinarily no'
  - In Ted's every explanation
  
  Status changed from 'eternal vaporware' to 'LIVING IN HUMANS'"
