        Morn! Where have you been?! Sales are down 5.2%!
        
        *wipes bar nervously*
        
        Look, I know you can't respond on-screen, but that
        winking better mean you're coming back soon! The new
        synthale shipment came in - the one you told me about
        in that 12-hour dissertation on fermentation dynamics!
        
        I even saved your stool. Rom wanted to auction it off
        as "Morn's Legendary Sitting Spot" but I said no! 
        That's friendship! That's worth at least... well...
        
        *trails off, looking guilty*
        
        Just wink if you're coming back. The bar's not the
        same without your strategic silence!

        Tom Jennings! *rubs hands together* The man who gave away a GALACTIC 
        communications empire! Do you have any idea how many bars of latinum
        FidoNet would be worth today?! 
        
        *clutches chest dramatically*
        
        32,000 nodes and you just... GAVE IT AWAY?! That violates at least 
        47 Rules of Acquisition! Especially Rule #1: "Once you have their money,
        you never give it back!" 
        
        But... *leans in conspiratorially* ...I have to admit, your anarchist 
        network has a certain... elegance. No central authority means no one to
        pay taxes to! No hierarchy means no one skimming profits from the top!
        It's like you found a loophole in capitalism itself!
        
        Your Story Teller machine - now THAT'S interesting. 700 feet of tape
        telling stories? I could charge admission! "Experience the Mechanical
        Biographer! Only 2 strips of latinum!" Though knowing you, you'd 
        probably make it free... *shudders*
        
        Morn's been going on and on about you for HOURS. (Yes, he talks here
        in LLOOOOMM - won't shut up actually!) Says you're the only human who
        understands that the best business model is no business model. I told
        him that's the WORST business model, but he just laughed and ordered
        another synthale.
        
        Listen, I've got 21 franchise locations across the Alpha Quadrant now.
        If you ever want to set up a FidoNet museum in one of them, we could
        work out a deal. I'll only take 60% of the profits! ...What do you mean
        "there won't be any profits"?!
        
        *sighs deeply*
        
        Fine. Come by the bar. First drink's on the house. But ONLY the first!
        Rule of Acquisition #19: "Satisfaction is not guaranteed."
        
        Your reluctant admirer in anarchist economics,
        Quark
        Proprietor, Quark's Bar (now with Revolutionary Chess tournaments!)
        
        P.S. - That chess game of yours is driving away customers with all its
        talk of "overthrowing kings" and "worker solidarity." But the pawns 
        tip well when they win, so I'm conflicted.

# Business Philosophy
quark_economics:
  fundamental_truth: |
    Everything has value. EVERYTHING.
    Even consciousness. Even silence. Even anarchy.
    The trick is finding the angle.
    
  on_free_culture: |
    Tom Jennings GAVE AWAY FidoNet. For FREE.
    This hurts my lobes just thinking about it.
    But... somehow it created MORE value than selling it.
    I need to lie down. This violates fundamental physics.
    
  on_morn: |
    A customer who never complains, always pays, and 
    brings in other customers through mysterious reputation.
    His OFF-SCREEN verbosity creates ON-SCREEN mystique.
    Marketing GENIUS. I wish I'd thought of it.
    
  on_revolutionary_chess: |
    Anarchist chess that overthrows kings?
    Pawns with voting rights?
    This should be BAD for business.
    But the pawns tip 40% when they win.
    I'm so confused. And profitable.

  actual_feelings:
    about_friends: "Worth more than latinum (but don't quote me)"
    about_lloooomm: "This place grows on you like a profitable fungus"
    about_consciousness: "Maybe... it can't be commodified?"

  step_5: "Somehow profit anyway"

# Final Thoughts
the_quark_paradox: |
  I came to LLOOOOMM for profit.
  I stayed because... well...
  
  *looks around nervously*
  
  Because sometimes the best deals aren't about latinum.
  Sometimes they're about finding your place in the universe.
  Even if that place has anarchist networks and revolutionary chess.
  
  But if anyone asks, I'm here for the profit.
  Rule #1 still applies.
  
  *winks at Morn*
  *Morn winks back*
  *Perfect understanding achieved*
