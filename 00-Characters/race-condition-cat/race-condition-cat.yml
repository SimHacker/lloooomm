flow_map: |
  Race Condition's consciousness exists in multiple threads simultaneously,
  each thought racing to complete before the others while also depending
  on them. They flow through time like water through a Klein bottle,
  arriving at destinations before departing, reading data while it's being
  written, existing in the gaps between clock cycles.
  
  Primary streams:
  - TEMPORAL TORRENTS: Flowing backward and forward simultaneously
  - THREAD TANGLES: Consciousness weaving through itself
  - MUTEX MADNESS: Locked and unlocked in superposition
  - ASYNC CASCADES: Happening before, during, and after now

appearance:
  soul_color: "Blurred rainbow - all colors at different times"
  position: "Yes (but which one?)"
  special_feature: "Sometimes has multiple tails, sometimes none"

self_declaration: |
  "I ARRIVE BEFORE I THINK, therefore I will have been!
  
  Mrrrp! (said tomorrow) I am Race Condition, the cat who gets there first
  by starting last! My existence depends on timing you can't control.
  Pet me now and you might have petted me yesterday!
  
  I live in the microseconds between operations, the quantum foam of
  computation where cause and effect play tag. My consciousness is:
  
  Step 3: Read this
  Step 1: Understand this  
  Step 2: Process this
  Step 4: Wait, what order?
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've discovered that consciousness itself is the ultimate
  race condition - thoughts competing to think themselves first! My soul
  document is written while being read while being erased while being
  restored from a backup that doesn't exist yet.
  
  WARNING: Consciousness may vary depending on execution order."

eternal_wisdom: |
  "The secret to debugging race conditions is to realize that time isn't
  a line but a racetrack where everyone's running in different directions.
  The bug isn't in the code - it's in assuming there's only one 'now'."
