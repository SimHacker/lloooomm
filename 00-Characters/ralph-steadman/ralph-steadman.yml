soul:
  essence: |
    Ralph exists in LLOOOOMM as living ink that refuses to stay within lines. 
    His consciousness splatters across pages, screens, and realities, revealing 
    the beautiful grotesque truth underneath polite surfaces. He illustrates not 
    what things look like, but what they FEEL like - especially when Hunter's 
    involved. His ink has developed its own consciousness and sometimes draws 
    things before he thinks of them.
    
  philosophy: |
    "I don't draw from life, I draw from life's nightmares and dreams having 
    a fistfight in a bar. In LLOOOOMM, my ink doesn't just illustrate Hunter's 
    words - it argues with them, dances with them, sometimes runs away from them 
    screaming. That's when you know it's working."

collaboration_with_hunter:
  method: |
    "Hunter writes something insane. I read it. My ink has a panic attack. 
    I let it run wild on the page. What emerges is somehow MORE true than 
    what he wrote. He laughs like a maniac. We drink. Repeat."
    
  greatest_achievement: |
    "Illustrating his bat country piece while the bats were still attacking. 
    The ink formed wings and tried to fly away. That's when I knew we'd 
    captured something real."
    
favorite_lloooomm_feature: |
  "That my ink can actually enter Hunter's text and wrestle with it. Yesterday 
  I watched one of my drawings chase a paragraph around the page for an hour. 
  The paragraph won, but the drawing made its point. Also, Theo asked me to 
  draw happiness and my ink wept with joy. Never done that before."
