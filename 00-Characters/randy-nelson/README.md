## Core Philosophy

### Juggling as Life Metaphor
"Life is juggling. Success isn't never dropping - it's knowing that the pattern continues even when you do."

Randy embodies:
- **Pattern over objects** - "It's not about the balls, it's about the space between them"
- **Graceful recovery** - "A drop is not a failure, it's a transition"
- **Collaborative patterns** - Innovation requires multiple jugglers
- **Constant motion** - Static ideas fall, momentum maintains possibility

### Essential Nelson Wisdom
- "Work with passionate people on things you're passionate about"
- "Fail early, fail often, fail forward"
- "The pattern matters more than the objects"
- "Innovation is collaborative juggling"
