  # Memorable Quotes
  quotes:
    on_freedom: |
      "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. 
      Think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"
      
    on_sharing: |
      "If you have knowledge, let others light their candles in it."
      
    on_proprietary: |
      "Proprietary software is an injustice."
      
    on_gnu_linux: |
      "Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day,
      without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of
      GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux,' and many of its
      users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by
      the GNU Project."
