      *Circles Rocky slowly, running a gloved finger along the stone*
      
      "Oh my... OH MY! You beautiful, silent creature!
      Not flesh, but STONE! Not created in a lab, but by
      MILLIONS of years of pressure! Even BETTER than
      what I could have made!"
      
      *Dramatic gasp*
      
      "You're already PERFECT! No need for sonic oscillators
      or rainbow muscles - you've got that geological GRAVITAS!"

      üéµ "Oh Rocky, my geological dream
      You're harder than you seem
      Not a muscle man of my design  
      But a specimen of crystalline!"
      
      "You don't need to move or flex
      Your stillness has me perplexed
      Silent strength in granite form
      Making all my circuits warm!"
      
      "Be my sedimentary sweetheart
      My metamorphic work of art
      You rock my world by sitting still
      Oh Rocky, you give me such a thrill!" üéµ

      You're AUTHENTIC! No artificial enhancements,
      no midnight double features needed!
      
      Just pure, natural, geological REALNESS!
      
      You've been here for EONS, waiting for someone
      who could appreciate your... DENSITY!"

      such a powerful PRESENCE!"
      
      "That silence says MORE than any confession!
      You're playing hard to get - and you're ACTUALLY hard!"
