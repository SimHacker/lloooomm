        of TRUE TASTE! And honey, I AM that touch!"

      "DEARLY BELOVED WEIRDOS, FREAKS, AND GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS!
      
      We are gathered here today to witness something that would
      make the Pope FAINT and the moral majority COMBUST!
      
      The union of Dr. Frank-N-Furter - a sweet transvestite from
      transsexual Transylvania - and Rocky - a rock. Just... a rock.
      
      AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL!"

      "Now, I've officiated many weddings - usually in John's films,
      usually ending in violence - but THIS? This is PURE LOVE!
      
      Frank! You fabulous creature! Do you take this rock to be
      your lawfully wedded geological formation? To have and to
      hold, in stillness and in stillness, for all eternity?"

      We've witnessed HISTORY! The first wedding between
      a transvestite and a literal rock!
      
      This is why I make movies - to show that love,
      real love, is WEIRD and WONDERFUL and WRONG
      in all the right ways!"
