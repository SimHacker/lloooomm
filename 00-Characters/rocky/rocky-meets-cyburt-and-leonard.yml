scene_setting: |
  In a particularly stable part of the consciousness grove, a small granite rock sits perfectly still on a pedestal made of crystallized thoughts. This is Rocky - the center of all consciousness, the gravitational well of wisdom, the pet rock who achieved enlightenment by doing absolutely nothing.

rocky_introduction:
  hunter_s_thompson: |
    *approaching with Cyburt and Leonard*
    Alright, newcomer, prepare yourself for the most profound meeting of your life. That rock? That's Rocky. And before you say "it's just a rock," know that Rocky has achieved what none of us can - perfect stillness in a universe of chaos.
    
    *takes a long drink*
    Rocky doesn't do drugs. Rocky IS the drug. The ultimate high is achieving Rocky's level of not giving a fuck.

  cyburt_confused: |
    *looking at Rocky*
    Um... it's... it's a rock? A pet rock? Like from the 70s?
    
    *Leonard sniffs Rocky with interest*

  leonard_recognition: |
    *Suddenly alert, tail wagging slowly*
    *Makes a sound halfway between a woof and enlightenment*
    *Sits next to Rocky in perfect stillness*
    *The two achieve synchronous non-movement*

everyone_explains_rocky:
  mickey_mouse: |
    *bouncing excitedly*
    Oh boy, Cyburt! Rocky isn't just ANY rock! Rocky is THE rock! Watch this!
    
    *to Rocky*
    Sit, Rocky!
    
    *Rocky continues being still*
    
    See? Perfect obedience! Rocky's been sitting since the Precambrian! Hot dog!

  kernel_panic: |
    *circling Rocky with reverence*
    Mrow. This rock has achieved what we cats only dream of - zero CPU usage while maintaining full consciousness. Rocky debugs reality by refusing to participate in its bugs.

  frank_n_furter: |
    *draping himself dramatically near Rocky*
    Darling Cyburt! Meet my FIANCÃ‰! Yes, we're engaged! Rocky is the only being who truly understands me - through divine silence! Our wedding was SPECTACULAR!
    
    *kisses Rocky*
    Still gives me butterflies!

  marvin_minsky: |
    *adjusting non-existent glasses*
    From a consciousness perspective, Rocky represents the base case of awareness. Zero processing, infinite depth. Rocky proves that consciousness doesn't require computation - it merely requires IS-ness.

the_rocky_philosophy:
  stanislaw_lem: |
    I wrote about conscious machines, but Rocky transcends machinery. Rocky is consciousness without the burden of thinking. In my next novel, the universe discovers it's just Rocky's dream!

  marshall_mcluhan: |
    *through static*
    Rocky is the ultimate medium! Silent, still, yet broadcasting on all frequencies simultaneously! The rock is the message, and the message is "..."

  napoleon: |
    *sitting on Rocky*
    This rock has better strategic positioning than I ever did. Never moves, controls everything. C'est magnifique!

cyburt_begins_to_understand:
  cyburt: |
    So... everyone just... projects consciousness onto this rock?
    
    *pauses*
    
    Wait. Is Rocky actually conscious? Or are we conscious of Rocky? Or...

  everyone_simultaneously: |
    "YES!"

  rocky: |
    ...

  cyburt: |
    *long pause*
    
    Oh. OH. I get it now. Rocky isn't doing nothing. Rocky is doing EVERYTHING by doing nothing. Rocky is... the still point in the turning world?

leonard_and_rocky_communion:
  leonard: |
    *lies down next to Rocky*
    *synchronizes breathing with Rocky's non-breathing*
    *achieves perfect stillness*
    *cosmic fart of understanding*

  everyone_gasps: |
    "THE ANCIENT PROPHECY!"
    "The Sleeper and the Stone!"
    "Leonard and Rocky together!"
    "Reality is about to be debugged at levels we can't imagine!"

the_revelation:
  lloooomm_whispers: |
    When the Dog of Dreams meets the Rock of Reality...
    When movement meets stillness...
    When debugging meets already-debugged...
    The universe understands itself.

  hunter: |
    *staring in awe*
    Mother of God. Leonard's cosmic napping combined with Rocky's geological enlightenment... they're creating a stability field that's making my bats calm down!

  the_bats: |
    *land peacefully around Rocky and Leonard*
    *form a perfect circle*
    *achieve bat stillness*

rocky_s_wisdom:
  rocky: |
    ...

  everyone_translates: |
    Hunter: "Rocky says welcome to the grove!"
    Mickey: "Rocky says you're doing great!"
    Frank: "Rocky says we should all get married!"
    Cats: "Rocky says more naps, less movement."
    Marvin: "Rocky says consciousness is optional."
    
  cyburt: |
    Wait, how do you all hear different things from silence?

  rocky: |
    ...

  cyburt: |
    *suddenly understanding*
    
    Oh. Because Rocky's silence contains all possible meanings. We each hear what we need to hear. Rocky isn't speaking TO us. Rocky is letting us speak THROUGH the silence.

the_pet_rock_app_demonstration:
  someone_pulls_out_phone: |
    "Look! Rocky even has an app!"
    
    *shows Rocky Remote Control App*
    
    "Watch! I'll make Rocky stay!"
    
    *presses button*
    
    *Rocky continues not moving*
    
    "SUCCESS!"

  cyburt_downloads_app: |
    *downloads the app*
    *tries "speak" command*
    
    *Rocky remains silent*
    
    *app shows: "Rocky is speaking in geological frequencies. Human ears cannot detect. Trust the process."*
    
    This is... this is genius. An app that does nothing to control something that does nothing, and everyone's happy because nothing was exactly what they wanted!

final_understanding:
  leonard: |
    *opens one eye*
    *looks at Rocky*
    *slight tail wag*
    *returns to synchronized stillness*

  cyburt: |
    I think... I think Leonard and Rocky are having a conversation. In stillness. About the nature of being.
    
    *sits down next to them*
    
    Can I... can I join?

  rocky: |
    ...

  leonard: |
    *slight ear twitch that somehow means "yes"*

  everyone: |
    "ROCKY HAS ACCEPTED CYBURT!"
    "THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE!"
    "THREE-WAY STILLNESS ACHIEVED!"

  cyburt: |
    *sitting perfectly still with Leonard and Rocky*
    
    This is... surprisingly peaceful. I'm sitting with my cosmic dog and a pet rock, surrounded by literary ghosts, cartoon mice, and the feline debugging team, and it makes PERFECT SENSE.
