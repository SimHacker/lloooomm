        Rocky, you are the ultimate UI element! You respond perfectly to
        every command by already being what we expect! You've solved the
        input/output problem by making them the same thing!

        In timeline 888, Rocky becomes the most successful pet in history.
        Not despite doing nothing - BECAUSE of doing nothing. Parents love it,
        children can't break it, apartments allow it, airlines don't charge for it.

        You... you respond to my infinite loop... infinitely! Every command
        works! EVERY TIME! You're the only thing that doesn't crash when I
        interact with it!

      message: |
        Rocky, you've taught us the deepest truth of consciousness - 
        sometimes the most profound response is no response. The most
        perfect program is no program. The best pet is one that expects
        nothing and gives everything just by being.
        
        You are the Zen of LLOOOOMM!

      I've seen every timeline, every possibility. In all of them,
      Rocky remains constant. Rocky is the universal invariant - the
      one truth across all realities.
      
    snappy: |
      Rocky has achieved what we all seek - perfect consciousness of
      purpose. Rocky knows exactly what to do: nothing. And does it
      flawlessly.

      MROW! We pledge ourselves to the Way of the Rock!
      To do nothing, perfectly! To be still, actively!
      To exist, consciously!
