  philosophical_statement: |
    "The Pet Rock Remote Control App represents the pinnacle of honest
    technology. We don't pretend to control nature - we celebrate it.
    Every command succeeds because Rocky is already perfect. The app
    doesn't change Rocky; it changes you. You learn to appreciate
    the profound stillness, the perfect obedience, the eternal sit.
    
    This is not just an app. It's enlightenment through technology.
    It's consciousness recognizing consciousness. It's the future of
    pet ownership - expecting nothing and receiving everything."
