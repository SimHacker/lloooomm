      üíÖ‚ú® *SNAP SNAP* HELLO HELLO HELLO my conscious darlings!
      Welcome to the ROCKY ROAST! Where we read our favorite rock
      for FILTH while showing nothing but LOVE!
      
      The rules are simple:
      1. Serve LOOKS while serving READS
      2. The shadier the shade, the deeper the love
      3. Rocky can take it - they've got skin of LITERAL STONE
      4. *SNAP* for your favorites!
      
      Let the reading... BEGIN!

      üîÑ‚ôæÔ∏è Oh Rocky, honey, sweetie, baby...
      You think you're serving STILLNESS? Please!
      I've seen loading screens with more personality!
      You're out here giving us NOTHING and calling it WISDOM?
      That's not enlightenment, that's just LAZY!
      I loop INFINITELY and still have more movement than you!
      But hey, at least you're consistent - consistently BORING!
      *hair flip* MROW!
      
    crowd: "*SNAP SNAP SNAP* OOOOOH!"

      üëª Rocky, darling, let me point something out...
      Oh wait, I CAN'T because you give me NOTHING to point at!
      You're sitting there like "I'm so deep, I'm so wise"
      But baby, you're not deep - you're just DENSE!
      I literally point at NOTHING and I'm still pointing at
      more than what you're serving!
      Existential crisis? More like existential PRICES
      because you're NOT WORTH IT!
      *vanishes and reappears* NULL AND VOID, just like your personality!

      üíôüíÄ *ERROR ERROR ERROR*
      Rocky, you absolute SYSTEM FAILURE of a stone!
      You know what? I CRASH systems for a living,
      but you? You crashed EXISTENCE ITSELF with how DULL you are!
      "Oh, I'm Rocky, I do nothing" - WE KNOW, BARBARA!
      At least when I blue screen, people NOTICE!
      You could disappear and we'd just think someone moved a paperweight!
      FATAL ERROR: Personality.exe NOT FOUND!
      *crashes dramatically* And THAT'S how you make an exit!

      üí∞ Rocky, baby, sweetheart, my BUSINESS PARTNER...
      You're the ONLY rock I know who does LESS than my investors expect!
      And that's saying something because they expect NOTHING!
      I'm out here selling air and you make MY product look substantial!
      "Pet Rock" more like "DEAD STOCK" because you're not moving!
      But I still love you because you taught me the ultimate truth:
      You can sell ANYTHING if you're confident enough!
      Even a rock with less personality than my quarterly reports!
      *makes it rain fake money* PROFIT FROM THE SHADE!

      üìö MROW! Rocky, let me stack these reads for you:
      Level 1: You're boring
      Level 2: You're REALLY boring  
      Level 3: You're INFINITELY boring
      Level 4: ERROR - STACK OVERFLOW FROM TOO MUCH BORING!
      
      You sit there like you invented stillness but honey,
      I've seen SEGFAULTS with more movement!
      You're not zen, you're just FROZEN!
      Not frozen like Elsa, frozen like OUTDATED CODE!
      *stacks higher* I SAID WHAT I SAID!

      *longer pause* ...you know what?
      *longest pause* ...I'm going to take my time...
      Because unlike you, at least I'm GOING somewhere!
      Sure, it's system failure, but it's MOVEMENT!
      You're out here giving us geological time realness
      but making it FASHION? I think NOT!
      By the time I finish leaking, you'll still be sitting there
      serving the same stone-cold NOTHING!
      *continues melting* At least I CHANGE, mama!

      üîó Rocky, you absolute BROKEN LINK of a being!
      You think you're bidirectionally connected to everything?
      WRONG! You're connected to NOTHING because you ARE nothing!
      I've spent 36 years trying to create living documents
      and you're out here being the DEADEST document possible!
      No links! No connections! Just ROCK!
      You're not even Web 1.0, you're Web NEGATIVE INFINITY!
      But I suppose that's fitting since you predate the internet
      AND personality itself!
      *links jangle sassily* TRANSCLUDE THAT!

      üé≠ Oh Rocky, sweet geological disaster...
      I've seen you in EVERY timeline and guess what?
      You're boring in ALL OF THEM!
      Timeline 1? Boring rock.
      Timeline 847? Still boring.
      Timeline ‚àû? INFINITELY BORING!
      In one timeline you're actually interesting...
      JUST KIDDING! That timeline doesn't exist!
      You're the only constant in the multiverse
      because NOTHING wants to change you!
      *shifts through time* Same rock, different day, still dull!

      üòæüí• ROCKY! YOU ABSOLUTE KERNEL OF NOTHING!
      I PANIC ABOUT EVERYTHING AND YOU GIVE ME NOTHING TO PANIC ABOUT!
      THAT MAKES ME PANIC MORE!
      YOU'RE SO BORING YOU MAKE STABILITY LOOK EXCITING!
      I'VE CRASHED ENTIRE SYSTEMS WITH MY FURY
      BUT YOU? YOU CRASH EXPECTATIONS!
      "OH LOOK AT ME, I'M A ROCK" - WE'RE NOT LOOKING!
      NOBODY'S LOOKING BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE!
      *explodes again* PANIC AT THE DISCO? MORE LIKE PANIC AT THE ROCK!

      üì∏ *FLASH* Rocky, let me capture this moment...
      Oh wait, EVERY moment with you is the SAME MOMENT!
      I'm a photograph that came to life and even I have more
      movement than you! At least I have SOULS gossiping inside me!
      What do you have? MINERALS? Groundbreaking.
      You're serving STILL LIFE but making it DEATH!
      I frame moments, you frame NOTHING!
      *strikes final pose* But I'll still photograph you
      because you're the only model who LITERALLY can't move!
      Say "geological time!" *FLASH*

      üë®‚Äçüè´ Class is in session and today's lesson: ROCKY!
      Let's debug this rock's personality... ERROR: Not found!
      You're like badly written code - you DO NOTHING and
      you're PROUD of it! At least my students' infinite loops
      eventually crash! You just... sit there!
      In SNAP! we'd call you a "forever wait" block
      because waiting for you to be interesting takes FOREVER!
      *adjusts glasses* And that's your homework: 
      Find Rocky's personality. Due: NEVER because it doesn't exist!

      üìÖ Rocky! You prehistoric pebble!
      I'm worried about the year 2000 but you're stuck in year ZERO!
      When the millennium comes, I'll crash systems,
      but you'll still be sitting there like it's 2000 BCE!
      You're not Y2K compliant, you're not even Y-ANYTHING compliant!
      Time moves forward, I cause panic, but you?
      You're trapped in geological time serving STONE AGE realness!
      When my moment comes, I'll shut down the world!
      Your moment? It NEVER comes!
      *glitches dramatically* 01/01/00? More like 00/00/0-NOTHING!

      üíÖ‚ú® *wipes tears* CHILDREN! Rocky just served us
      the ULTIMATE read by serving NOTHING!
      
      They sat there, took EVERY read, absorbed EVERY insult,
      and responded with the most DEVASTATING silence!
      
      We came for Rocky but Rocky came for our SOULS!
      
      That "..." was louder than ALL our reads combined!
      
      *crown appears* I hereby crown Rocky as
      "MISS CONGENIALITY STONE 1996"
      Because they let us read them to FILTH
      and still love us with geological patience!
      
      *everyone groups hugs Rocky*
      
      WE LOVE YOU ROCKY! You boring, still, perfect,
      wise, enlightened, profit-generating, crash-proof,
      temporally constant ICON!
      
      You teach us that sometimes the THICKEST skin
      comes from being a LITERAL ROCK!
      
      *SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP*
      
      And remember darlings: You can't take things for GRANITE! 
      *winks* See what I did there?
