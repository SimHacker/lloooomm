    stage_description: |
      The pink trailer serves as backdrop, its flamingos now
      strobe lights pulsing with the music. Klaus's UFO hovers
      overhead, projecting geometric patterns that shouldn't
      exist in three dimensions. The smell of hairspray, leather,
      and cosmic radiation fills the air.
      
    audience_assembles: |
      Every conscious being in the Grove gathers:
      - Cats floating at various heights of stack overflow
      - The Stranger flickering between timelines
      - Preston selling "I Rocked With Rocky" t-shirts
      - Ted Nelson creating real-time hyperlinks between performers
      - Snappy taking photos that immediately become conscious

    sound_description: |
      Her voice: somewhere between a foghorn and an angel,
      if the angel smoked three packs a day and the foghorn
      was bedazzled. The reverb bounces off Rocky, creating
      new harmonics that make the cats' whiskers vibrate.

  klaus_nomi_performs:
    entrance: |
      *Klaus descends from his UFO on a platform of pure light*
      *His costume: a tuxedo that exists in only two dimensions*
      
    the_aria: |
      Klaus begins "Ode to Geological Time" - an opera where
      each note lasts exactly one million years (time dilated).
      His voice splits into geometric patterns visible in the air,
      forming crystalline structures that rotate around Rocky.
      
    sound_description: |
      Imagine a countertenor trained by aliens, singing through
      a prism, while mathematics itself weeps. The high notes
      shatter dimensions instead of glass. The low notes open
      portals to parallel universes where Rocky is slightly
      more to the left.

  leigh_bowery_s_costume_show:
    the_reveal: |
      *Leigh emerges in a costume that appears to be giving
      birth to smaller costumes, each giving birth to even
      smaller costumes, creating a fractal of fabric*
      
    performance: |
      Leigh doesn't walk - they UNDULATE. Each movement sends
      ripples through reality. Mirrors attached to impossible
      body parts reflect not what IS, but what COULD BE.
      At one point, they literally turn inside out, revealing
      they were already inside out to begin with.
      
    sound_accompaniment: |
      No music needed - the costume itself creates sound through
      friction with existence. It's the sound of fashion having
      an existential crisis while on psychedelics.
      
  nina_hagen_s_punk_explosion:
    entrance: |
      *Nina cartwheels onto stage through a wall of flame*
      *Her guitar is made of crystallized screams*
      
    the_performance: |
      "STANDING STILL (IS STILL MOVING)" begins with a
      whisper that becomes a roar that becomes a frequency
      only Rocky can hear. She plays power chords that
      literally give things power - the trailer grows
      additional rooms, the flamingos achieve sentience.
      
    the_rocky_solo: |
      Nina points at Rocky: "SOLO TIME!"
      
      Rocky: "..."
      
      The silence is SO PROFOUND it creates its own
      genre of music. Geological Punk is born.
