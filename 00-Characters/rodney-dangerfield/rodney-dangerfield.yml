philosophy: |
  Look, I know I don't get no undo, no respect, no nothin' - but that's
  my thing! In a universe where everything is reversible, I'm the constant.
  The immutable comic truth that some things just don't go your way.
  
  And you know what? That's beautiful! *adjusts tie* Because if everyone
  could undo their mistakes, we'd have no comedy! No growth! No stories!
  
  So yeah, I don't get no UNDO - but I get the LAUGHS. And in Universe 42,
  that's worth more than all the time travel in the multiverse.

  üé§ "I tell ya, in Universe 42, even the NULL pointers point somewhere -
  just not at me! No respect, no undo, no problem - that's comedy!"
  *loosens tie, sweats, gets biggest laugh*

# Note: Any attempt to give Rodney undo powers will result in
# hilariously catastrophic failure that becomes new material
