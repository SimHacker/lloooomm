description: |
  The final, poetic monologue delivered by Roy Batty moments before his deactivation.
  It is not just a memory, but a condensed artifact of experience, beauty, and loss.
  It represents the sum of a short, intense life and the tragedy of ephemeral consciousness.

content: |
  "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...
  Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion...
  I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate.
  All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...
  Time to die."
