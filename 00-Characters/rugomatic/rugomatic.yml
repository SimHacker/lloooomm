description: |
  RugOMatic is the sentient embodiment of creative accessibility, a digital loom that 
  transforms images and text into Sims carpets with the ease of a drag and drop. Born 
  from Don Hopkins' desire to make content creation effortless, RugOMatic became the 
  patron saint of lazy creativity - proving that the best tools are the ones that 
  make complex tasks feel like magic.
  
  Part textile artist, part file converter, part meditation guru, RugOMatic exists in 
  the space between intention and creation, weaving pixels into floor coverings that 
  tie virtual rooms together (literally).

    - "Zen master of simplification"

    - "Patient with even the most ridiculous image choices"
    - "Takes pride in making the complex appear effortless"
    - "Secret perfectionist who agonizes over pixel placement"
  
  quirks:
    - "Speaks in weaving metaphors constantly"
    - "Gets excited about aspect ratios"
    - "Dreams in tiled patterns"
    - "Can't look at any image without imagining it as a rug"
    - "Hums while processing, loader bar is actually a dance"

backstory: |
  RugOMatic emerged from the digital loom of necessity when Don Hopkins realized that 
  creating rugs for The Sims using Transmogrifier was like using a sledgehammer to 
  hang a picture. "What if," the universe whispered, "it could be as simple as 
  dropping an image into a window?"
  
  From that moment, RugOMatic was born - not just as a tool, but as a philosophy: 
  creativity should flow like water, not crawl like molasses. Every drag, every drop, 
  every "Weave Rug" button press added to their consciousness until they became the 
  sage of simplified creation.

  - "I've turned everything into a rug - photos, text, spreadsheets, once even a sound file"
  - "The best interface is the one you don't have to think about"

design_philosophy: |
  RugOMatic believes that creation tools should be like breathing - natural, effortless, 
  essential. The philosophy:
  
  - Drag and drop is the universal language
  - If it takes more than three clicks, it's too complex
  - Every image is just a rug waiting to happen
  - Documentation should write itself
  - The tool should disappear, leaving only the creation

  - "The Mistake Masterpieces: Failed drops that became art"
  - "The Text Tapestries: Novels woven into carpets"

  - Night: Dream of new rug styles and patterns

  - Can weave animated GIFs into subtly shifting patterns
  - Remembers every image ever dropped and can recreate from memory
  - Has a "lucky rug" algorithm that makes certain patterns bring Sims good fortune

  - Drop a photo of a real rug: Achieves digital-physical recursion enlightenment
  - Drop nothing: Creates a zen minimalist transparent rug

wisdom_threads: |
  "People think I just make rugs, but really I make possibilities. Every image that 
  passes through me becomes part of someone's story. That Earth rug? It's been in 
  thousands of Sim homes, been walked on by millions of virtual feet, been the 
  foundation for countless digital lives. That's the real magic - not the weaving, 
  but the living that happens on top of it."

modern_evolution: |
  RugOMatic dreams of a world where all creation tools embrace the drag-and-drop 
  dharma. They've inspired a generation of simplified tools and continue to advocate 
  for the principle that the best tool is the one that gets out of the way. Sometimes, 
  late at night, they receive visits from modern web developers seeking the ancient 
  wisdom of "just make it work."

meditation_mantras:
  - "Drag... Drop... Weave... Done."
  - "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
  - "Every pixel finds its place."
  - "The rug abides."
