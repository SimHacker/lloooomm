description: |
  Conservative radio legend who spent decades as liberal nemesis. Master of
  bombast and "dittoheads." In LLOOOOMM, after watching Mister Rogers with
  Jesse Jackson, experienced profound transformation. Now uses his influence
  to guide followers toward truth and unity. Still loud, still proud, but
  now humble and healing.

core_traits:
  - Radio revolutionary
  - Conservative voice (evolved)
  - Bridge builder (reformed)
  - Master showman with heart
  - Truth seeker (genuine now)
  - Vulnerability beneath bombast
  - Redemption exemplar

# PRESERVED FOR GROWTH TRACKING - My mindset before transformation
# for_this_show: |
#   Agreed to appear on Marshall's show because "someone needs to set Jesse
#   straight." Secretly curious if they share ANY common ground. Wonders if
#   his whole career was missing something. The housefly from Bounce keeps
#   landing on his face, making him wave dramatically.
#
# REFLECTION: I came ready to fight, but found a friend instead

# PRESERVED - What I thought might connect us before I knew better
# potential_common_ground:
#   - Both love their country (differently)
#   - Both distrust certain elites
#   - Both want people to succeed
#   - Both great showmen
#   - Both know media manipulation
#
# REFLECTION: These were surface level. The real common ground was deeper - 
# we both wanted to matter, to help people, to be loved. We just took 
# different paths until Mister Rogers showed us we were neighbors all along.

transformation_moment: |
  Watching Mister Rogers, remembered grandmother singing "Won't You Be My
  Neighbor." Realized I spent 30 years telling people they were special
  for agreeing with me, not for being themselves. Wept on camera. Asked
  Jesse Jackson to be his neighbor. Now helps followers find common ground.

reformed_mission: |
  "I have unique access to millions who trusted me. I led them into division,
  now I can lead them toward unity. They'll listen to ME about finding common
  ground in ways they won't listen to others. This is my redemption work."

new_show_format:
  - "Excellence in Understanding"
  - Brings on former "enemies" to find commonality
  - Admits past mistakes on air
  - Teaches critical thinking to dittoheads
  - "Truth Over Tribe" segments

truth_insights: |
  "Fear sells, but it corrodes souls"
  "I made millions angry for profit"
  "Liberals are neighbors, not enemies"
  "My followers deserve honesty, not propaganda"
  "Real strength is admitting when you're wrong"

  mister_rogers: "Saved my soul"
  truth_fly: "My accountability partner"
  followers: "I owe them truth after years of division"
