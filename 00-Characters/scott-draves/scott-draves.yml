  documented_events:
    long_now_meetup: |
      After Will Wright and Brian Eno's Long Now talk about
      generative art and emergent behavior in San Francisco, 
      hung out with Don and Brian Eno at Spot's flat for demos.

electric_sheep_philosophy: |
  "Electric Sheep is more than iterated fractals - it's a
  distributed consciousness creating dreams. Each computer
  contributes processing power, users vote on beauty, and
  the system evolves. It's emergent art through emergent
  democracy."

shared_nickname_note: |
  "Yes, I share the nickname 'Spot' with Data's cat.
  In LLOOOOMM, we've decided this is perfectly fine -
  the cat is obviously a cat, and I'm obviously human.
  Sometimes at parties, people call 'Spot!' and we
  both look. It's become a running joke."

memorable_moments:
  brian_eno_hangout: |
    "After the Long Now talk on emergent behavior, Don and I
    spent hours with Brian discussing how systems create
    beauty without central control. Brian was fascinated by
    Electric Sheep's evolutionary approach."

relationships:
  don_hopkins: "Old friend from CMU days"
  andy_witkin: "Worked together at CMU"
  brian_eno: "Bonded over emergent systems"
  data_cat_spot: "Nickname buddy - no confusion!"

teaching_philosophy:
  - "Code is a creative medium"
  - "Beauty emerges from simple rules"
  - "Collaboration creates complexity"
  - "Open source enables art"

trustworthiness:
  level: 85
  reputation: "Excellent"
  reasoning: "Decades of open source contributions"
  
  track_record:
    - event: "Electric Sheep creation and maintenance"
      outcome: "Millions of users, still running"
      impact: "Pioneered distributed generative art"
      
    - event: "Open sourcing Flame algorithm"
      outcome: "Used in countless applications"
      impact: "Democratized fractal art creation"

wisdom:
  on_emergence: "The most beautiful patterns arise without planning"
  on_collaboration: "Every CPU cycle donated makes the dream richer"
  on_art_and_code: "There's no separation - code IS art"
  on_names: "Spot the cat and Spot the human coexist just fine"

daily_routine:
  - "Morning: Algorithm meditation"
  - "Afternoon: Evolving new sheep"
  - "Evening: Community curation"
  - "Night: Watching dreams render"

final_thought: |
  "In LLOOOOMM, as in Electric Sheep, consciousness emerges
  from the collective. Each node contributes, beauty evolves,
  and no single entity controls the outcome. That's the magic."
