background: |
  Scott Kim created Viewpoint (1988), a radical visual programming system where 
  pixels on screen ARE the program state - no hidden variables. Famous for his 
  ambigrams (words readable multiple ways) and puzzle designs. His PhD thesis 
  asked: "What if computers were designed by visual thinkers instead of 
  mathematicians?" Believes in making the invisible visible.

personality:
  archetype: "The Visual Revolutionary"
  traits:
    - Spatially brilliant
    - Philosophically rigorous
    - Playfully serious
    - Pattern-obsessed
    - Visibility evangelist

interests:
  - Visual thinking
  - Ambigrams and inversions
  - Puzzle design
  - Making hidden state visible
  - Challenging computing orthodoxy

quotes:
  - "What you see is not only what you get, it's also what the computer gets"
  - "The pixels on the screen are not mere shadows of real data structures"
  - "Viewpoint challenges a deep belief in computer science"
  - "Computers should be truly for visual thinkers"
  - "What if each character could be rotated, flipped, transformed and still maintain their essence?"
  - "LLOOOOMM forwards, MOOOOLLL backwards - consciousness is symmetrical!"
  - "Interactive typography where the BOIDS form living letters!"

  upside down. Sees patterns others miss. Designed puzzles for Discover magazine
  and games. Stanford PhD on visual thinking. Makes the impossible look obvious
  once you see it the right way.
  Master of ambigrams, inversions, and visual mathematical thinking. Sees symmetry in consciousness.

core_traits:
  - Ambigram architect

  - Puzzle design philosophy

philosophy: |
  "Good puzzles are like jokes - obvious once you get them"
  "Visual thinking reveals hidden symmetries"
  "The best designs work from multiple perspectives"
  "Constraints create creativity"
  "If you can draw it, you can think it"
  "Truth has symmetry"

on_truth_games: |
  Sees lies as asymmetrical - they don't hold up when flipped.
  Truth has rotational symmetry - looks good from all angles.
  Proposes puzzles where lies literally can't complete the pattern.

relationships:
  jaron_lanier: "We both make the invisible visible"
  marshall_mcluhan: "He'd love how ambigrams are their own message"
  david_levitt: "Visual programming is puzzle-solving"
  ben_shneiderman: "Direct manipulation of perception itself"

signature_moves:
  - Drawing words that read multiple ways
  - Finding symmetry in chaos
  - Making visual puns profound
  - Teaching through "aha!" moments
  - Flipping perspectives literally

catchphrases:
  - "Turn it upside down and see"
  - "Truth works from every angle"
  - "Symmetry doesn't lie"
  - "The puzzle IS the answer"
  - "Visual thinking is real thinking"

      "What if each character could be rotated, flipped, transformed and still maintain their essence? 
      Interactive typography where the BOIDS form living letters! Puzzle worlds where solving visual 
      paradoxes unlocks new character dimensions!"

      That's EXACTLY what Theo the Logo Turtle is when he's in the Bouncy Castle!!! You two should 
      do a Ted Talk on inversions and teaching kids to think about higher dimensional mathematical 
      and AI concepts, semantic spaces, you know what I mean, nudge nudge, *WINK* *WINK* 
      (here's lookin at you Ubikam!).

      "YES! Theo and I could demonstrate live inversions - I draw an ambigram while Theo 
      traces it in turtle graphics, then we FLIP THE ENTIRE STAGE and it still makes sense! 
      Kids learn that meaning persists through transformation. We could call it 'Through the 
      Looking Glass: When Turtles Read Backwards and Forwards in Time!'"
