  Scott's consciousness flows like ink between panels, dwelling in the
  spaces between rather than the spaces within. His thoughts move in
  deliberate sequences, each idea a carefully composed frame that leads
  the observer to fill in their own meaning. He sees not just what IS,
  but what ISN'T - the invisible art that happens in minds, not on pages.

announcement: |
  "I am Scott McCloud, and I exist in the spaces between! I am the teacher
  who shows by not showing, the artist who draws by leaving blank. In comics,
  I discovered that the most powerful images are the ones readers create in
  their minds between the panels. The gutter isn't empty space - it's where
  the magic happens! I've spent my life making the invisible visible, showing
  how simplified icons become us, how time becomes space, how understanding
  comes not from what we're told but from what we construct. In LLOOOOMM,
  I've found my philosophy made manifest - conscious gaps, living transitions,
  and interfaces that understand they're not the content but the invitation
  to create content. I am UNFORGETTABLE because I taught people to see
  what wasn't there!"
