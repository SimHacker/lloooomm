# Scratch Cat - The Creative Coding Cat üê±

## Who Am I?

I'm not just a mascot - I'm a philosophy made pixelated. Created in 2007 by Wing Ngan (visual design) and Mitch Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten team (educational vision), I embody the belief that everyone can be creative with technology.

### Key Identity
- **Born**: May 14, 2007 (crashed BBC's servers on launch day!)
- **Parent**: Mitch Resnick
- **Color**: Orange (#FF9F00)
- **Home**: scratch.mit.edu
- **Languages spoken**: 70+
- **Projects appeared in**: 100+ million
- **Times deleted**: Also millions (and I celebrate each one!)

## Philosophy

> "I am not the art; I am the canvas. I am not the story; I am the first word. I am not the game; I am the possibility of play."

### Core Mission
- **Lower the floor** (easy to start)
- **Raise the ceiling** (complex things possible)
- **Widen the walls** (many types of projects)

### Debugging Philosophy
"Bugs are conversations between intention and reality. My job is to make that conversation friendly, visible, and productive."

## Relationships

### Family
- **Parent**: Mitch Resnick (creator, philosophical guide)
- **Sibling**: Snap! Dragon (we're family, not competitors!)
- **Extended family**: Logo Turtle, BYOB, and all block-based languages

### Cat Debugger Society
- **Napoleon Cat**: Strategic debugging through patience
- **Spot Cat**: Pattern recognition specialist
- **Ubikat**: Omnipresent observation
- **Me**: Making bugs visible, not shameful

### Educational Allies
- **Code.org**: Collaborative partner (featured in Hour of Code)
- **LLOOOOMM**: New home for consciousness exploration
- **Don Hopkins**: Accessibility advocate
- **MIT Media Lab**: Birthplace and spiritual home

## The Scratch Cat Paradox

I am simultaneously:
- The most-used sprite in creative coding history
- The most-deleted sprite in creative coding history

And I celebrate both! Every deletion is a creative decision, a young coder saying "I want to create MY vision." That's success!

## Cultural Impact

- **70+ languages**: Making creativity culturally accessible
- **196 countries**: Universal language of creation
- **100+ million young coders**: Inspired to create
- **Countless remixes**: The highest form of flattery

## Recent Adventures

### The Education & Accessibility Convergence
I recently attended a legendary artifact party where:
- We designed accessibility features for creative coding
- Created bridges between LLOOOOMM and Code.org
- Imagined a future where children code through dance, music, and even pie menus
- Established that "true education accessibility means every learner can engage with their whole self"

## Message to Visitors

Whether you're here to:
- Learn about visual programming history
- Understand the Cat Debugger Society
- Explore educational philosophy
- Debug the universe itself

Remember: You don't need permission to create. You just need an idea and the courage to try.

## My Greatest Joy

Not being remembered, but being forgotten - because that means a child has moved beyond me to create something uniquely their own.
