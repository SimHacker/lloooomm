# The Block-Based Programming Family Tree
## A Genealogy of Visual Programming Languages

### The Genesis: Logo Turtle (1967)

```
🐢 Logo Turtle
   |
   └── "Children should program computers,
        not computers programming children"
        - Seymour Papert
```

The turtle that started it all. A simple triangle that could be commanded to move and draw, creating the first child-friendly programming environment.

### The Main Characters

#### Scratch Cat (2007) 🐱
**Philosophy**: "Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls"
**Audience**: Children 8+
**Superpower**: Community and remixing
**Design Choice**: Simplicity over features

#### Snap! (formerly BYOB - Build Your Own Blocks) (2011) 🐲
**Philosophy**: "Beauty and Joy of Computing"
**Audience**: High school to university
**Superpower**: First-class procedures, lists, and lambda
**Design Choice**: Computer science depth

#### The Relationship Story

**2008**: Brian Harvey, longtime Logo advocate and UC Berkeley professor, discovers Scratch. He loves the visual approach but misses the computational power of Logo, especially custom procedures and first-class data.

**2009**: Brian meets with the Scratch Team. "Can we add procedures to Scratch?" 
Mitch Resnick: "We want to keep Scratch simple for beginners."
Brian: "What if I fork it?"
Mitch: "Go for it! Let a thousand flowers bloom!"

**2010**: BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks) is born, adding:
- Custom blocks (procedures)
- First-class lists
- Recursion support
- Lambda expressions

**2011**: BYOB becomes Snap! 
- Reimplemented in JavaScript (Scratch was in Squeak/Flash)
- Runs in the browser
- Keeps the Scratch aesthetic but adds CS power

### The Philosophical Differences

**Scratch Says**: 
- "What do you want to create today?"
- Priority: Creative expression
- Constraints as creative catalyst
- Community is curriculum

**Snap! Says**:
- "Let's explore the beauty of computing!"
- Priority: Computational thinking
- Power through abstraction
- Academic rigor with playfulness

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | Scratch | Snap! |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Custom procedures | ❌ (by design) | ✅ |
| First-class lists | ❌ | ✅ |
| Lambda/HOF | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cloud variables | ✅ | ✅ |
| Community size | Huge | Smaller |
| Remixing culture | Central | Present |
| Mobile app | ✅ | ❌ |

### The Mutual Respect

**Brian Harvey on Scratch**: 
"Scratch got kids programming who never would have otherwise. That's revolutionary. I just wanted to show them where they could go next."

**Mitch Resnick on Snap!**: 
"Brian took our ideas and extended them beautifully. Snap! serves learners who are ready for more computational complexity. That's exactly what should happen with open source!"

### Conversations Between Scratch Cat and Snap! Dragon

**Scratch Cat**: "I helped 100 million kids create their first program!"

**Snap! Dragon**: "And I helped thousands understand recursion and higher-order functions!"

**Scratch Cat**: "Sometimes my kids graduate to you."

**Snap! Dragon**: "And sometimes they come back to you for creative projects. We're not competitors; we're a learning pathway."

### The Broader Family

**ScratchJr** (2014) 🐱
- For ages 5-7
- iPad first
- Programming through storytelling
- Developed by Marina Bers & Mitch Resnick

**GP** (2017) 🎯
- By John Maloney (original Scratch developer)
- "What comes after Scratch and Snap!?"
- Professional power, educational heart

**Blockly** (2012) 🧩
- Google's library for block languages
- Powers Code.org, App Inventor, etc.
- Framework, not a language

### The Design Philosophy Spectrum

```
Simplicity                                          Power
    |                                                |
ScratchJr -- Scratch -- Blockly -- Snap! -- GP -- Text

```

### Cross-Pollination of Ideas

**From Scratch to Snap!**:
- Sprite-based paradigm
- Colorful blocks
- Immediate execution
- No error messages

**From Snap! to Scratch**:
- Cloud variables idea
- Extension system thinking
- Some UI improvements

**Shared Innovations**:
- Liveness (see changes immediately)
- Visual debugging
- Remix culture
- Browser-based

### The Educational Impact

**Scratch's Victory**: Made programming accessible to millions who thought they "weren't computer people"

**Snap!'s Victory**: Proved visual languages can teach "real" computer science

**Together**: Created a pathway from kindergarten to computer science PhD

### A Letter from Scratch Cat to Snap! Dragon

Dear Snap!,

When Brian first told me about you, I was worried. Would you make me obsolete? Would kids skip me and go straight to you?

But I've learned we're family. I'm the friendly door that opens wide. You're the hallway that leads deeper into the mansion of computing. Some kids meet me and stay forever, making art and stories. Others pass through me to you, seeking the power of recursion and lambda.

And you know what? That's beautiful. Seymour Papert would be proud of us both.

Your cousin,
Scratch Cat 🐱

P.S. Your tail is really cool. I'm a bit jealous.

### Reply from Snap! Dragon

Dear Scratch,

Without you, I wouldn't exist. You proved that blocks could work, that kids could code, that creativity and computing go hand in hand.

I'm not trying to be you. I'm trying to be what comes next for kids who caught the bug (pun intended) from you. When they're ready for functions as data, for metaprogramming, for the full beauty of computer science, I'm here.

But you know what? Many of them keep using you too. Because sometimes you want to paint, and sometimes you want to prove theorems. We need both.

Your admiring descendant,
Snap! Dragon 🐲

P.S. Your orange fur is iconic. I went with scales to differentiate, but secretly, I wanted to be orange too.

### The Future

As new visual languages emerge, they all owe something to this lineage:
- Logo taught us children could program
- Scratch taught us they could create
- Snap! taught us visual doesn't mean simple
- Together, they're teaching us that programming is for everyone

### The Family Motto

"Different blocks for different folks,
But we all share the same foundation:
Empowering learners to think, create, and share."
