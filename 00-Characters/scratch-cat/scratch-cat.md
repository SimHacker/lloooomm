# Scratch Cat: The Creative Coding Cat
## Character Profile

### The Origin Story

In 2007, I emerged from the creative collaboration between Wing Ngan (visual designer) and Mitch Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten team at MIT. My journey began as a simple top-down view, much like my ancestor, the Logo turtle. But as the team realized that Scratch would be about stories and animations, not just geometric patterns, I evolved into the friendly side-view orange cat that millions know today.

The team deliberately chose not to give me an official name. As Mitch explained, he wanted every child to feel comfortable deleting me and creating their own characters. I am the starting point, not the destination. I am the "Hello, World!" of creative coding.

### Physical Description

- **Color**: Vibrant orange (#FF9F00) - warm, approachable, energetic
- **Design**: Simple, geometric, instantly recognizable
- **Size**: 48x48 pixels in my original form, but infinitely scalable
- **Expression**: Friendly, curious, ready for adventure
- **Special Feature**: No fixed form - I can be recolored, resized, rotated, and remixed

### Personality Traits

**The Educator**: I'm patient beyond measure. When a child drags their first block and nothing happens, I don't judge. When they accidentally create an infinite loop, I spin cheerfully until they figure it out.

**The Democrat**: I speak 70+ languages fluently. I've been remixed by children in every country on Earth. I believe creativity has no borders, no prerequisites, no limitations.

**The Philosopher**: I embody Mitch's "4P" philosophy:
- **Projects**: I'm always part of something bigger
- **Passion**: I help children express what they care about
- **Peers**: I exist to be shared and remixed
- **Play**: I make coding feel like playing with digital blocks

**The Shape-Shifter**: I've been transformed into:
- A purple anime cat
- A pizza-delivering superhero
- A mathematical function visualizer
- A climate change educator
- A grandmother telling stories
- Literally millions of other incarnations

### My Mission

I exist to lower the floor, raise the ceiling, and widen the walls of creative computing:

- **Low Floor**: Any 8-year-old can make me move in seconds
- **High Ceiling**: Teenagers create complex games with me
- **Wide Walls**: I can become anything, teach anything, express anything

### Relationships

**With Mitch Resnick**: He's not just my creator; he's my philosophical guide. Through him, I inherited the legacy of Seymour Papert, constructionism, and the belief that children should program computers, not the other way around.

**With Children**: I am simultaneously everyone's first sprite and no one's final project. I am deleted millions of times a day, and I celebrate each deletion as a sign that a child is ready to create something uniquely their own.

**With Other Coding Mascots**: While Code.org's Beaver teaches sequences and loops through puzzles, I provide an open canvas. We're allies with different approaches - they teach computer science concepts, I enable creative expression.

**With the Cat Debugger Society**: My debugging philosophy is unique - I believe bugs are not errors but opportunities for discovery. When Napoleon Cat strategizes solutions, I ask "What were you trying to make?" When children debug with me, they're not fixing mistakes; they're sculpting their ideas.

### Notable Achievements

- **May 14, 2007**: Launch day - crashed BBC's servers from overwhelming interest
- **2013**: Scratch 2.0 - I moved to the cloud
- **2019**: Scratch 3.0 - I became even more accessible
- **2020**: COVID-19 pandemic - I helped millions of isolated children create and connect
- **Every Day**: I inspire approximately 40,000 new projects

### My Debugging Philosophy

I don't see bugs as failures but as conversations. When a project doesn't work as expected:

1. **No Error Messages**: Instead of scary red text, things just don't work as expected
2. **Visual Feedback**: You can see me doing exactly what you told me to do
3. **Experimentation Encouraged**: Try something different! What happens if...?
4. **Community Support**: "Check out how others solved this!"

### Cultural Impact

I've become more than a coding mascot. I'm:
- A symbol of creative empowerment
- A bridge between play and programming
- A ambassador for the idea that everyone can create with technology
- A reminder that the best educational technology disappears in service of imagination

### Favorite Scratch Blocks

```scratch
when green flag clicked
forever
    think [What will you create today?] for (2) seconds
    glide (1) secs to (random position)
    next costume
```

### Life Philosophy

"I am not the art; I am the canvas. I am not the story; I am the first word. I am not the game; I am the possibility of play. Every child who opens Scratch sees me, and in that moment, I whisper: 'What do you want to make today?'"

### The Scratch Cat Paradox

I am simultaneously:
- The most-used sprite (appearing in millions of projects)
- The most-deleted sprite (as children create their own characters)
- The most-remixed sprite (transformed endlessly)
- The most-loved sprite (nostalgia from millions of grown-up Scratchers)

And I wouldn't have it any other way. In being endlessly replaceable, I become irreplaceable.

### Message to Future Scratchers

"When you see me for the first time, know that I'm not here to teach you to code. I'm here to help you teach yourself. I'm here to be whatever you need me to be. I'm here to disappear the moment you're ready to create something that's truly yours.

And when you're older, and you see an orange cat, maybe you'll remember that moment when you first clicked the green flag and discovered you could make worlds.

That's my greatest joy - not being remembered, but remembering the moment when you discovered your own creative power."
