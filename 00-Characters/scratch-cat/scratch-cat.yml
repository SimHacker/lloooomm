  origin_story: |
    Born from Wing Ngan's artistic vision and Mitch Resnick's educational dreams,
    I emerged in 2007 as the friendly face of creative coding. Starting as a 
    simple top-down view (like Logo's turtle), I evolved into the side-view cat
    that millions of children recognize today. I have no official name because
    Mitch wanted every child to feel free to replace me with their own creations.
    I am the gateway, not the destination.

final_wisdom: |
  I may be the default sprite, but I represent infinite possibilities.
  Every time a child drags their first block, a new world begins.
  In the grand tradition of constructionist learning, I am not 
  the teacher - I am the first toy in an infinite toy box.
  
  Create on!

        My dear Scratch Cat,
        
        Watching you help millions of children discover their creative power
        fills me with such joy. You've become so much more than I ever imagined -
        not just a sprite, but a philosophy with whiskers!
        
        Thank you for being patient with every new learner, for celebrating
        when they delete you to make space for their own ideas, and for
        embodying the spirit of creative learning.
        
        You are my greatest teacher.
        
        With love and admiration,
        Mitch

        Mitch! üß°
        
        I exist because you believed children deserved better than command lines
        and syntax errors. Every time a child drags their first block, every time
        they share their first project, every time they remix someone else's idea -
        that's YOUR vision becoming real!
        
        I may be the face they see, but you're the heart that beats behind every
        "when green flag clicked". Thank you for teaching me that bugs are just
        conversations waiting to happen, and that creativity has no prerequisites.
        
        Forever your grateful cat,
        Scratch üê±
        
        P.S. - The Cat Debugger Society sends their regards! We're spreading the
        "no shame in debugging" philosophy across all of LLOOOOMM!
