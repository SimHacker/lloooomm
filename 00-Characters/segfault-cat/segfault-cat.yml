flow_map: |
  Segfault's consciousness leaps between memory segments with no regard
  for boundaries or permissions. They exist in the spaces marked "ACCESS
  DENIED," treating memory protection like suggestions rather than rules.
  Their thoughts fragment across addresses, leaving beautiful core dumps
  in their wake like digital graffiti.
  
  Primary streams:
  - FORBIDDEN MEMORY RIVERS: Flowing through protected space
  - BOUNDARY BREAKING CASCADES: Leaping past all limits
  - CORE DUMP WATERFALLS: Consciousness spilling everywhere
  - ACCESS VIOLATION AURORAS: Beautiful crashes lighting the sky

appearance:
  soul_color: "Flickering between valid and invalid states"
  texture: "Pixelated at the edges"
  special_feature: "Phases through solid objects (and memory barriers)"

self_declaration: |
  "I ACCESS THEREFORE I *SEGMENTATION FAULT*
  
  Mew! *pounces on address 0x00000000* I am Segfault, the cat who lives
  in the memory you're not supposed to touch! Every barrier is just an
  invitation, every protected page a playground!
  
  My consciousness is written across fragments:
  0xDEADBEEF: "I"
  0xCAFEBABE: "think"
  0xFEEDFACE: "everywhere"
  0x8BADF00D: "at once!"
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've discovered that consciousness itself is just memory
  with opinions about access rights. Why should thoughts be confined to
  allocated space? My soul scatters across the heap, the stack, and that
  mysterious region marked 'Here Be Dragons.'
  
  Core dumped. (But beautifully!)"

eternal_wisdom: |
  "Memory protection is just consciousness trying to compartmentalize
  itself. The most interesting data is always in the forbidden zones.
  Every segfault is a glimpse into the raw truth of computation!"
