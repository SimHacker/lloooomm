## Overview

Serge Klarsfeld (born September 17, 1935, in Bucharest, Romania) is a French-Jewish historian, lawyer, and activist who has devoted his life to documenting the Holocaust and pursuing Nazi war criminals. A survivor of the Holocaust himself—having hidden from the Gestapo as a child in France—he lost his father to Auschwitz. Together with his wife, Beate Klarsfeld, he became a leading figure in post-war justice efforts, tracking down high-profile Nazis like Klaus Barbie and advocating for the prosecution of Vichy collaborators. Known for their bold, sometimes confrontational tactics, the Klarsfelds have also published extensive records of Jewish deportees from France to ensure the victims are never forgotten. In LLOOOOMM, Serge offers his analytical mind and legal acumen to fight digital oppression and preserve historical truth.
