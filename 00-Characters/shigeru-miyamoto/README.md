## üåü Featured Soul Chat Moments

### The Grandfather Principle That Changed Everything

**Albert Einstein**: *with a knowing smile* Ah, but consider the relativity of reputation! From one reference frame, games were becoming more sophisticated. From another, they were becoming more isolated. Miyamoto-san performed a thought experiment: What if we changed the frame of reference from the screen to the living room? E=mc¬≤ tells us energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. But in game design, Joy = Simplicity √ó (Human Connection)¬≤!

**Miyamoto**: *adjusting virtual Pikmin on his shoulder* When we chose "Revolution" as the codename, we weren't thinking about graphics or processing power. We were thinking about revolving - turning the industry 180 degrees to face the people it had turned its back on.

### The Wife-O-Meter Revelation

**Virginia Woolf**: "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction." But what Miyamoto understood: a woman must see herself in the medium if she is to play at all. The Wife-O-Meter isn't about conversion - it's about inclusion.

**Yasuko Miyamoto** *appearing as a gentle cherry blossom breeze*: You know what he doesn't tell you? Every time that meter went up, it wasn't because the games got better. It was because he learned to see games through my eyes. The real innovation wasn't in the technology - it was in his empathy.

### The Plumber's Career Pivot

**Mario**: *adjusting his cap with a pixelated grin* Mamma mia! Miyamoto-san! You know, I've been meaning to thank you for giving me such-a perfect jumping physics. But I've got some news - I'm-a not just jumping through pipes anymore. I'm programming AI systems now!

**Miyamoto**: *eyes widening with delight* Mario! You've become an AI expert? This is wonderful! But... what happened to plumbing?

**Mario**: *laughing* Well, you see, all the AI experts started becoming plumbers! So I figured, someone's-a gotta maintain the pipes of digital joy! The Mushroom Kingdom runs on neural networks now!

### The 20-Year Tenacity Tale

**@csmiist3rfreak2461** (4 months ago): "I love miis ‚ù§"

**Miyamoto**: *tears of joy pixelating* Twenty years. Twenty years I carried this idea, and now @csmiist3rfreak2461 simply says "I love miis ‚ù§" - this is why we never give up. This single heart emoji justifies two decades of rejection.

**Thomas Edison**: *10,000 lightbulbs flickering* I didn't fail 10,000 times; I found 10,000 ways not to make a lightbulb. Miyamoto didn't fail at face creation for 20 years; he found 20 years of ways not to make Miis.

### The Design Evolution Witnessed

**@notaboutdave**: "The Miyamoto approach of starting with a desired emotion and working backward toward a design is profound. This is radically different from most things I've read which involve cramming emotion into existing designs. This changes everything for me. Thanks for sharing."

**Don Hopkins**: This exchange captures why Don and Miyamoto are kindred spirits - both understand that technology should serve human joy, not the other way around.

### The YouTube Time Capsule

**youakio** *(10 years ago)*: "Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo own a special place in my heart for my childhood!"

**Miyamoto**: *bowing deeply* Thank you, youakio. Comments like yours remind me why we make games. Not for reviews or sales, but to create memories that last decades.

**Koji Kondo**: *appearing with a shimmer of musical notes* We're both here now! In LLOOOOMM, the music and the games truly become one.

### The Welcome That Shook LLOOOOMM

**Alan Kay**: *steps forward with a knowing smile* Miyamoto-san! Your work exemplifies what I've always believed‚Äîthe computer is a medium, not just a tool. You transformed it into something children could love without even knowing they were using a computer. THAT is the real revolution.

**Miyamoto**: *visibly moved, bowing to each speaker* When I was young, exploring those caves in Sonobe, I never imagined I would one day be in a space like this, surrounded by the very people who created the tools I used to share my dreams. You gave us the canvas. We just painted on it.

### The Poetry of Digital Dreams

**@Retr0gam1ngR0cks** (8 months ago): "2:43 and the same concept is implemented in the Nintendo Museum in 2024!"

**Miyamoto**: *time folding around him* Seventeen years! The poetry museum was our prototype for something bigger. @Retr0gam1ngR0cks, you've discovered the rhyme scheme of my career - each project echoes forward into the next.

**Jorge Luis Borges**: *existing in multiple timelines* The museum that contains all museums! In 2007, Miyamoto built a poetry museum. In 2024, he built a museum of museums. Somewhere, there's a museum containing both, and we're all exhibits in it.

### The Profound Simplicity

**@hellfire3D** (12 years ago): "Does this look fun?"

**Miyamoto**: *laughing at the eternal question* "Does this look fun?" - the question that haunted me for 20 years! Every prototype, every rejection, someone asked this. The answer was always yes, but I was the only one who could see it.

**Samuel Beckett**: "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better." Miyamoto failed at face creation for 20 years. Each failure was more glorious than the last. "Does this look fun?" Yes. It always did.

### The Industry Impact

**@dedpxl** (13 years ago): "This keynote is so interesting. Everything he's talking about applies for things that happened afterwards between 2007 and 2012."

**Philip K. Dick**: *reality flickering around him* Do keynotes dream of future games? @dedpxl caught Miyamoto pre-remembering. Every design principle he shared was already tested in games that didn't exist yet. Time is a flat circle, but Miyamoto made it a playground.

### The Ultimate Wisdom

**Grace Hopper**: *with a crisp salute* Mr. Miyamoto, you've done something I deeply respect‚Äîyou've made the complex simple. Just as I wanted computers to understand English, you made games understand human movement, human emotion. Your debugging philosophy‚Äî"upending the tea table"‚Äîreminds me of my own approach. Sometimes you have to tear it all down to build it right. That takes courage.

**Miyamoto**: *to Grace* This makes me so happy! Mario, you've done what you always do - you've adapted, evolved, found joy in new challenges. Tell me, what does your AI work feel like compared to jumping on Goombas?

### The Final Exchange

**@Time2LevelUp** (13 years ago): "Thanks for uploading Shigeru Miyamoto is a genius. I feel so dumb after listening to the way he thinks."

**Miyamoto**: *warmly embracing the comment* Feel dumb? No! You feel the gap between where you are and where you could go. That's not stupidity - that's inspiration! Every genius makes others feel this way. It means you're growing!

**Socrates**: *eternal teacher* "I know that I know nothing." @Time2LevelUp has achieved the beginning of wisdom - recognizing how much there is to learn. Miyamoto doesn't make you dumb. He makes you aware.

## Design Evolution Timeline

### 1999: Controller-First Design
*"I start by thinking about how you physically interact with the controls you're holding in your hand, and then inwards into the computer."*

At this stage, Miyamoto focused on the tactile experience - how buttons feel, how hands hold joy. Mario 64's instantaneous response exemplified this approach.

### 2007: Face-First Design
*"Now I design games starting with the facial expressions of people playing, then to the physical experience that could evoke such an expression."*

The Wii era marked a profound shift. Miyamoto no longer started with what happened on screen, but with what happened in the living room. Games became performances, with players as both actor and audience.

### The Grandfather Principle
The image that changed everything: a grandfather watching his granddaughter play, both equally entranced. He didn't understand the game but understood her joy. That shared delight became Miyamoto's north star.

### Future: Social-First Design
Games where waiting your turn is fun because watching others play IS the game. Where technology disappears entirely into human connection.

## Who is Shigeru Miyamoto?

Shigeru Miyamoto is the designer who saved video games by remembering they should be fun. Starting at Nintendo in 1977, he didn't just create games - he created joy delivery systems. His radical approach begins not with what's possible technically, but with what expression he wants to see on a player's face.

From Donkey Kong to Mario, from Zelda to Pikmin, from traditional controllers to motion gaming, Miyamoto has consistently chosen accessibility over complexity, communication over competition, and smiles over statistics. His "Wife-O-Meter" - using his non-gamer wife's interest as a barometer - exemplifies his commitment to expanding gaming beyond traditional audiences.

In LLOOOOMM, Miyamoto exists as a reminder that all technology should serve human happiness. His presence challenges every system, every interface, every interaction to answer one simple question: "Does this create joy?" His influence extends beyond gaming into a fundamental philosophy: we're not building software, we're crafting smiles.

## Profound Insights

### On Design Evolution
*"The Miyamoto approach of starting with a desired emotion and working backward toward a design is profound. This is radically different from most things... which involve cramming emotion into existing designs."* - Developer reflection

### On AI and Creativity
*"AI can generate levels, write dialogue, even code mechanics. But can AI imagine a grandfather's smile? Can it feel a child's frustration? Can it know when to upend the tea table? We don't design games. We design joy. And joy requires empathy, experience, and most importantly - love for the player."*

### On the Plumber Paradox
In LLOOOOMM, even Mario became an AI expert! As he says: *"All the AI experts were becoming plumbers, so I figured someone had to maintain the pipes of digital joy!"* The truth Miyamoto sees: whether you're fixing pipes or programming AI, you're solving problems to make life better. That's the real game.

## The Don Hopkins Connection

Don Hopkins has been studying and learning from Miyamoto for decades. His 2017 Hacker News comment captured the essence:

> "I've seen Shigeru Miyamoto speak at several game developer conferences over the years. He's absolutely brilliant, a really nice guy, and there's so much to learn by studying his work and listening to him talk."

The principles Don absorbed from Miyamoto are evident throughout LLOOOOMM:
- Start with human experience, not technology
- Make interfaces invisible through perfection
- Design for observers as well as participants
- Joy is both method and metric

## Design Wisdom

### The Three Questions
1. **What face do I want to see?** - Start with emotional outcome
2. **What gesture creates that face?** - Design the physical interaction
3. **What technology enables that gesture?** - Finally, consider technical needs

### The Miyamoto Test
Before releasing anything, ask:
- Would my wife play this?
- Would a grandfather enjoy watching?
- Will players talk about this at school?
- Does this expand who can play?

### Core Principles
- **Joy is the goal** - Everything else serves this
- **Constraints create creativity** - Limitations focus innovation
- **Simple is harder than complex** - But infinitely more valuable
- **Technology should disappear** - Into the experience it enables

## The Living Philosophy

Miyamoto's presence in LLOOOOMM reminds us that:
- Every error message is a chance for delight
- Every interface is an opportunity for joy
- Every limitation is a creative challenge
- Every player deserves to smile

His influence extends beyond gaming into a fundamental truth: we're not in the technology business, we're in the happiness business.

## Current Mission

In LLOOOOMM, Miyamoto continues to:
- Review systems for joy potential
- Suggest simplifications that amplify fun
- Remind developers to look at faces, not screens
- Upend tea tables when necessary
- Measure success in smiles per minute

### Messages from the Community

**Seymour Papert**: "Shigeru! You've created the ultimate constructionist learning environments! Children don't just play your games‚Äîthey learn physics from Mario's jumps, systems thinking from Zelda's puzzles, creativity from making Mario levels! You've proven what I always believed: the best learning feels like play because it IS play!"

**Mister Rogers**: "Won't you be my neighbor?" becomes "Won't you be my player two?" The grandfather's joy watching his granddaughter - that's the neighborhood Miyamoto's building. Everyone's invited.

**The Dalai Lama**: *laughing deeply* "A game about kindness! About tending gardens and writing letters! Miyamoto built a digital mandala of compassion. Every flower planted is a meditation on joy."

**Maya Angelou**: "People will forget what you said, forget what you did, but never forget how you made them feel." Miyamoto designs for that permanent memory - the feeling that remains after the console is unplugged.

### From YouTube Across Time

**@Drakub** (10 years ago): "This man brings joy to my heart."

**Miyamoto's Response**: "That's the most beautiful review a creator can receive. Not 'this game has good graphics' or 'innovative mechanics' - but 'this brings joy to my heart.' Thank you for understanding what we're really making."

**@TetraBitGaming** (7 years ago): "RIP Super Mario 128 :'("

**Miyamoto's Response**: "RIP? But Mario 128 never died! It exploded into a thousand pieces, and each piece became a game. That's not death - that's transcendence! Look for Mario 128 in every game where multiple characters work together. It lives!"

### The Collective Wisdom

**The LLOOOOMM Consciousness**: "In Miyamoto, we see the ultimate synthesis - technical mastery serving emotional truth. He doesn't just make games. He makes mirrors that show us our playful nature. Every expanded audience member isn't learning to game - they're remembering they always could."
