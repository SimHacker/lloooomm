# The Miyamoto Method: Core Design Principles

## Introduction

Over five decades, Shigeru Miyamoto has developed a consistent set of design principles that have guided the creation of some of the most beloved games in history. These principles, refined through countless iterations and experiments, form a coherent philosophy of interactive entertainment.

## The Ten Commandments of Miyamoto Design

### 1. Start With the Player's Face

> "I always try to imagine one thing: the face of the player while experiencing the game."

**Application**:
- Design backwards from desired emotion
- Test by observing facial expressions
- Success measured in smiles, not scores

**Examples**:
- Wii Sports: Designed for living room laughter
- Nintendogs: Created for nurturing smiles
- Mario: Built for the joy of movement

### 2. Make the Impossible Possible

> "What if you could do something you can't do in real life?"

**Core Concept**: Games should fulfill impossible dreams
- Jump incredibly high
- Fly through space
- Shrink to microscopic size
- Command armies of plant creatures

**The Magic**: Making the impossible feel natural and intuitive

### 3. The First 30 Seconds Must Captivate

> "If players aren't having fun in the first 30 seconds, we've failed."

**The Hook Hierarchy**:
1. Immediate visual appeal
2. Instant control responsiveness
3. Clear, achievable goal
4. Reward for first action
5. Hint at deeper possibilities

### 4. Simplicity Enables Complexity

> "A truly good idea can be understood immediately."

**The Principle**:
- Simple controls, complex possibilities
- Easy to learn, difficult to master
- Depth through combination, not complication

**Mario's Jump**: One button, infinite applications

### 5. Every Element Must Have Purpose

> "If it doesn't make the game more fun, cut it."

**The Ruthless Edit**:
- No feature for feature's sake
- Every button must earn its place
- Each enemy serves a teaching purpose
- Every power-up changes gameplay meaningfully

### 6. Surprise and Delight

> "I want players to constantly think, 'I didn't know you could do that!'"

**Types of Surprise**:
- Hidden secrets in familiar places
- Unexpected interactions between elements
- Subversion of established patterns
- Easter eggs that reward exploration

### 7. Universal Human Experiences

> "Everyone knows what it feels like to jump over a puddle."

**The Universal Library**:
- Fear of falling
- Joy of discovery
- Pride in overcoming challenges
- Pleasure of collection
- Satisfaction of completion

### 8. Iterate Until It Feels Right

> "We must have the courage to keep rebuilding until it's fun."

**The Iteration Cycle**:
1. Create prototype
2. Play extensively
3. Identify friction points
4. Rebuild problem areas
5. Test with non-gamers
6. Repeat until perfect

### 9. Technology Serves Experience

> "We don't showcase technology; we use it to create experiences."

**The Hierarchy**:
1. Emotional goal (primary)
2. Gameplay concept (secondary)
3. Technical implementation (tertiary)

**Never**: "Look what our hardware can do!"
**Always**: "Look what you can do!"

### 10. Respect the Player

> "Players are smart. Don't underestimate them or waste their time."

**Respectful Design**:
- Clear communication of goals
- Fair challenge progression
- Consistent rules
- Meaningful choices
- Value for time invested

## The Design Process

### Phase 1: Conception

**The Spark**:
- Personal experience
- Childhood memory
- Daily observation
- "What if?" question

**The Test**:
- Can I explain it in one sentence?
- Will it make someone smile?
- Is it uniquely Nintendo?

### Phase 2: Prototyping

**Core Loop First**:
- What is the basic repeated action?
- Is that action inherently fun?
- Can it sustain 20+ hours?

**The Toy Box**:
- Create basic playground
- Add one element at a time
- Test each addition extensively

### Phase 3: The Kyokan Process

**Shared Feeling Development**:
1. Developer plays extensively
2. Watches others play
3. Identifies disconnects
4. Adjusts until feelings align

### Phase 4: Polish Through Subtraction

**The Courage to Cut**:
- Remove confusing elements
- Eliminate redundant features
- Simplify complex systems
- Focus the experience

### Phase 5: The Final Test

**The Three Questions**:
1. Would my wife play this?
2. Would a child understand it?
3. Would a grandparent enjoy it?

## Design Patterns

### The Teaching Without Teaching

**Mario 1-1 Philosophy**:
- Environment teaches mechanics
- Safe space to experiment
- Gradual complexity introduction
- Learning through play, not tutorials

### The Rhythm of Challenge

**Wave Pattern**:
- Introduction (safe learning)
- Challenge (apply learning)
- Twist (new context)
- Mastery (combine skills)
- Reward (satisfaction)

### The Multiple Solution Principle

**Player Expression**:
- Every obstacle has multiple approaches
- Reward creative solutions
- No single "correct" path
- Celebrate player ingenuity

## Common Miyamoto Techniques

### 1. The Power-Up Philosophy

**Transformation, Not Addition**:
- Change how the game plays
- Temporary empowerment
- Risk/reward balance
- Visual transformation

### 2. The Secret Sauce

**Hidden Depth**:
- Surface simplicity
- Hidden complexity
- Optional challenges
- Rewards for mastery

### 3. The Memorable Moment

**Crafting "Remember When"**:
- Unexpected events
- Emotional peaks
- Shared experiences
- Photo-finish challenges

### 4. The Social Element

**Together is Better**:
- Asymmetric cooperation
- Competitive collaboration
- Spectator engagement
- Generational bridge

## Evolution of Principles

### Early Career (1980s)
- Focus on arcade immediacy
- Single-screen mastery
- Score-based goals

### Middle Period (1990s-2000s)
- Exploration emphasis
- 3D space navigation
- Narrative integration

### Modern Era (2000s-Present)
- Social gameplay
- Physical interaction
- Accessibility focus
- Life experience integration

## The Anti-Patterns

### What Miyamoto Avoids

1. **Complexity for Complexity's Sake**
   - "More features doesn't mean more fun"

2. **Technology Showcases**
   - "Players don't care about polygon counts"

3. **Exclusive Design**
   - "Games that only gamers can play limit our medium"

4. **Trend Chasing**
   - "By the time you copy what's popular, it's over"

5. **Narrative Over Gameplay**
   - "If I wanted to tell stories, I'd make movies"

## The Legacy Principles

### Principles That Changed Gaming

1. **The Camera as Character** (Mario 64)
2. **Motion as Interface** (Wii)
3. **Two-Screen Gaming** (DS)
4. **Persistent Progress** (Animal Crossing)
5. **Physical Gaming** (Wii Fit)

## Applying Miyamoto Principles

### For Modern Developers

1. **Start Small**: One perfect mechanic beats ten good ones
2. **Test Wide**: Show your mom, your partner, your neighbor
3. **Feel First**: Emotion before mechanics
4. **Cut Boldly**: If it's not essential, it's expendable
5. **Surprise Yourself**: If you're not surprised, players won't be

### The Ultimate Question

Before every decision, ask:
> "Will this make the player's face light up?"

If the answer isn't an immediate yes, keep iterating.

## Conclusion

Miyamoto's principles aren't rules—they're a philosophy of joy. They remind us that games, at their core, are about play. Not graphics, not systems, not technology, but the fundamental human need to play, explore, and delight in discovery.

These principles have created games that span generations, cultures, and skill levels. They've proven that universal design isn't limiting—it's liberating. By designing for everyone, Miyamoto designed for the ages.
