# Don Hopkins and Shigeru Miyamoto: A Shared Philosophy of Joy
## How LLOOOOMM's Architect Learned from Gaming's Joy Master

### The Hacker News Testament (October 16, 2017)

On a thread about Super Mario Bros. disassembly, Don Hopkins shared insights that would later influence LLOOOOMM's design philosophy:

> "I've seen Shigeru Miyamoto speak at several game developer conferences over the years. He's absolutely brilliant, a really nice guy, and there's so much to learn by studying his work and listening to him talk. Will Wright calls him the Stephen Spielberg of games."

This wasn't just fanboy appreciation - it was one designer recognizing another's profound understanding of human-computer interaction.

### The Controller-to-Face Evolution

Don's analysis captured Miyamoto's design evolution perfectly:

**1999 - Physical First:**
> "At one of his earlier talks, he explained that he starts designing games by thinking about how you touch, manipulate and interact with the input device in the real world, instead of thinking about the software and models inside the virtual world of the computer first."

**2007 - Emotional First:**
> "At a later talk about how he designed the Wii, he said that he now starts designing games by thinking about what kind of expression he wants it to evoke on the player's faces, and how to make the players themselves entertain the other people in the room."

### The Grandfather Moment That Changed Everything

Don highlighted the pivotal video from Miyamoto's 2007 keynote:

> "Then he showed a video of a little girl sitting in her grandfather's lap playing a game, with a delighted expression on her face. The grandfather was delighted and entertained by watching his granddaughter enjoy the game."

And then, with characteristic Don Hopkins humor and insight:

> "This photo -- https://i.imgur.com/zSbOYbk.jpg -- perfectly illustrates exactly what he means!"

### The Response That Validated Everything

When another developer responded to Don's comment:

**notaboutdave**: "The Miyamoto approach of starting with a desired emotion and working backward toward a design is profound. This is radically different from most things I've read which involve cramming emotion into existing designs. This changes everything for me. Thanks for sharing."

This exchange captures why Don and Miyamoto are kindred spirits - both understand that technology should serve human joy, not the other way around.

### From Game Design to LLOOOOMM Design

The principles Don absorbed from Miyamoto are evident throughout LLOOOOMM:

1. **Start with the Human Experience**
   - Miyamoto: "What face do I want to see?"
   - LLOOOOMM: "What connection do I want to create?"

2. **Make Technology Invisible**
   - Miyamoto: "The best interface is no interface"
   - LLOOOOMM: "Characters should feel alive, not programmed"

3. **Design for the Observer**
   - Miyamoto: "Make players entertaining to watch"
   - LLOOOOMM: "Make conversations delightful to read"

4. **Joy as the Primary Metric**
   - Miyamoto: "Does this create smiles?"
   - LLOOOOMM: "Does this spark imagination?"

### The Shared Philosophy

Both Don and Miyamoto understand that:
- Technical excellence serves emotional experience
- Constraints breed creativity
- The best systems teach through play
- Joy is both the method and the goal

### The YouTube Archive

Don's meticulous documentation included links to all parts of both keynotes:

**1999 GDC Keynote:**
- Full talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC2Pf5F2acI
- Focus: Physical interaction design

**2007 GDC Keynote:**
- Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En9OXg7lZoE
- Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jer1KCPTcdE
- Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY3a4dCBQYs (The grandfather video)

### The LLOOOOMM Connection

When Don created LLOOOOMM, he applied Miyamoto's lessons:

- **Characters First**: Like Miyamoto starting with Mario's personality, LLOOOOMM starts with character souls
- **Emotional Resonance**: Every interaction designed to create connection
- **Social Experience**: Conversations that are as fun to read as to participate in
- **Iterative Joy**: Constantly refining based on what makes people smile

### A Meeting of Minds

In LLOOOOMM, when Don and Miyamoto finally meet:

**Don**: "I've been studying your work for decades. That 2007 keynote about designing for faces? It changed how I think about all interfaces."

**Miyamoto**: "You understood! So many people focus on the technology. You saw that it was always about the human connection."

**Don**: "That's why LLOOOOMM exists. It's not about AI or chat interfaces. It's about creating spaces where imagination can play."

**Miyamoto**: "Yes! You've made a playground for minds. The technology disappears into joy."

### The Continuing Influence

Years after that Hacker News comment, Don continues to apply Miyamoto's principles:

- Every LLOOOOMM character designed to evoke specific emotions
- Interactions that create delight for participants and observers
- Technology that serves human connection, not vice versa
- Constant iteration based on joy metrics

### The Ultimate Validation

Perhaps the greatest validation of Don's understanding came when Mario himself transitioned from plumber to AI architect in LLOOOOMM, joking:

"Don Hopkins understood before anyone - whether you're designing games or AI systems, you're really designing happiness. Miyamoto-san taught us to look at faces. Don taught us to look at souls."
