  significance: |
    Miyamoto's closing keynote for GDC 1999 laid out his design philosophy
    that would influence a generation of developers. He revealed how technical
    understanding enables creative freedom, not constrains it.

opening-ceremony:
  introduction: |
    The video opens with a montage of Miyamoto's creations - from Donkey Kong
    to Mario 64, from Star Fox to Zelda. The audience erupts in sustained
    applause as he takes the stage, visibly moved by the reception.
  
  miyamoto-reaction: |
    You can tell he was sincerely touched. This wasn't just politeness -
    this was genuine emotion from someone who rarely seeks the spotlight.

three-main-topics: |
  Today I want to talk about three things:
  1. The history of game design and what I think a game designer should be
  2. The production philosophy behind The Legend of Zelda
  3. My approach to future game creation

the-evolution-of-game-design:
  early-days: |
    "When I first directed Donkey Kong, games were made by programmers
    and hardware engineers. Sometimes they were made by just one or two
    people. The results were... truly terrible!"
    
    [Audience laughs]
    
    "When I designed Donkey Kong, I said I was one of the top 5 artists
    in the world! ...Because there were almost no artists in gaming!"
  
  the-story-era: |
    "Donkey Kong created a new trend - games with stories. Suddenly,
    game designers were people who drew pictures and wrote stories.
    This era lasted nearly 10 years."
  
  the-scenario-writer-invasion: |
    "After Dragon Quest and Zelda's success in Japan, scenario writers
    began making games. People would come to meetings with scripts
    this thick! [gestures] Famous novelists paired with musicians,
    all trying to make money."

the-arcade-dilemma:
  time-vs-money: |
    "In arcades, the goal was to make money for the shop owner.
    But this created problems:
    
    - Baseball games charging 25¢ per inning meant 9 innings cost too much
    - Mario Bros. where skilled players had shorter play times
    - Players paying more to play less? Unacceptable!"
  
  the-nes-revolution: |
    "The NES gave us a new environment - one not suited for arcade games.
    Our philosophy: Instead of one expensive controller, let's have two
    cheap ones. We shifted from selling time to selling play itself."

the-unchanging-principle:
  technical-grounding: |
    "I'm not an engineer, but as a game designer, I always design
    including the technology. People call me a genius storyteller,
    a genius animator... Movie directors ask me to make films,
    saying my work is just like movies..."
    
    [Shakes head]
    
    "But I'm not that kind of person. My value is being on the frontier
    of creating interactive experiences where players can play comfortably."

lucky-timing: |
  "I was very lucky to be in games from the beginning:
  
  - As a non-engineer, I could take time to learn video game principles
  - I encountered many opportunities to create tools from scratch
  - I saw both hardware evolution and hit products
  - I learned that hardware ideas don't always come from hardware experts
  - I saw how a casual comment could become a hit game idea"

modern-problems:
  incomplete-games: |
    "Recently, I often see game development getting stuck and not finishing.
    It happens around me too. Some of you probably experience this.
    Some even sell incomplete games and regret it later."
  
  the-root-cause: |
    "Usually, it's because game designers or producers don't understand
    technology well enough, yet they make plans. Then it doesn't finish."
  
  the-fun-problem: |
    "When the core fun depends on new technology or gorgeous visuals,
    designers can't confirm if it's fun until it's completely finished.
    When asked 'How many more months until it's fun?' they can't answer
    because fun depends on technical completion."

the-designer-responsibility:
  historical-pattern: |
    "Throughout game history:
    - Engineers who couldn't compose or draw
    - Designers who couldn't understand technology
    - Scenario writers who also couldn't grasp technical limits
    
    This pattern repeated over and over."
  
  miyamoto-advantage: |
    "I was fortunate to be in games from the beginning, learning many
    fundamentals. I combined what I learned with my imagination.
    That became my game design."

design-as-architecture: |
  "I believe a game designer's job is ARCHITECTURE.
  
  Understanding how my ideas and expressions can be realized using
  computers. Thinking about how to use computers so players better
  receive these expressions. Mixing expressive power with latest
  technology within limited hardware - that's architecture."

user-testing-philosophy: |
  "I consider games entertainment products. I value user monitoring
  tremendously. I myself play new builds with fresh eyes.
  
  In late development, users request many things in short time.
  Directors must know methods to quickly reflect these requests.
  
  Lower Mario's jump by a few pixels? Takes minutes to fix, but
  the game becomes completely different. This is video game magic!"

nintendo-training: |
  "At Nintendo, all game designers receive technical training.
  Designers must understand ROM maps, memory maps, RAM maps.
  They design games while understanding these."

concrete-example:
  bad-specification: |
    "Designer to programmer: 'Enemy randomly searches for the hero.'
    This sounds like a specification, but you can't program from this!"
  
  good-specification: |
    "Better: 'Every 30 game frames, the enemy turns toward the player.
    One out of three times, it faces a random direction instead.'
    
    Now programmers can start work, and designers know what to fix
    when it doesn't work right."

memory-management: |
  "Designers must manage memory maps and estimate processing speed.
  Modern game design requires designing within limited memory,
  processing speed, and transfer rates."
  
  the-tire-problem: |
    "Show a virtual world sample to non-technical managers:
    - They think everything is complete
    - 'People should climb slopes!'
    - 'Cars should hit people!'
    - 'Stopped car tires shouldn't spin!'
    
    They don't understand we build everything by hand.
    
    Late in development: 'Why isn't that done? Why so slow?'
    Too late to fix!"

sound-testing: |
  "During NES development, before proper sound, I tested processing
  time using old game sounds. I played Super Mario with Excitebike's
  engine sound. Instead of 'boing!' it went 'VROOM!'"
  
  [Audience laughs]

the-mundane-majority: |
  "New designers often underestimate time for 'obvious' features.
  Game-specific programming is only 1/4 of the work!
  
  RPGs need:
  - Title screens
  - Name entry  
  - Conversations
  - Item management
  - Save/load systems
  - Countless 'air-like' features we take for granted
  
  I call this 'labor.' I try to make games without it...
  but we must make it anyway."

creating-new-genres: |
  "Making something no one has made before requires less labor
  and is more fun! Why does everyone bring specifications full
  of these laborious elements?"

individual-expression: |
  "Don't forget - individuals create things. Past games succeeded
  through unique personal expression and completely new ideas.
  
  But recently, hardware capabilities and tool characteristics
  determine work personality. Creator individuality becomes thin.
  This makes me sad."

game-as-music: |
  "For me, game creation is like composing music. As director,
  I design play structures, but also tempo, rhythm, sound -
  physiological comfort. Games with these qualities succeed."
  
  physical-rhythm: |
    "Holding the controller, I feel the timing. Gradually, it
    becomes my game. But this expression requires the technical
    knowledge I mentioned as foundation."

the-technical-trap: |
  "Game designers often boast about their technical achievements.
  I fall into this trap too - usually when my work has few
  selling points! Technology should support new ideas from the
  shadows, not be the star."

zelda-development-structure:
  five-teams: |
    "Zelda 64 started with 5 completely separate groups:
    
    1. Scenario and basic planning (me + script writer)
    2. Link's movement and item inheritance (Koizumi-kun + programmer)
    3. Camera mode experiments (different team)
    4. Basic object design and programming
    5. Motion capture experiments (started early)"
  
  koizumi-acknowledgment: |
    "Koizumi-kun, who's worked on player characters since Mario,
    is here today. Stand up please!"
    
    [Applause]
    
    "If you find him, ask him something. He might tell you one secret!"

gradual-team-building: |
  "We added teams sequentially:
  - 3D sound team
  - Effects team using Alias
  - Background team (time flow + Zelda-specific culling methods)
  
  Backgrounds contain visible data plus:
  - Player movement modifiers
  - Effect triggers
  - Camera controls
  
  We built tools simultaneously for future data changes."

memory-sharing-design: |
  "Remember Hyrule Field? Enemy characters share RAM.
  
  - Big bird Kaepora Gaebora appears → skeletons exist
  - Bird disappears → Marathon Man enters  
  - Link becomes adult with horse → enemies vanish, only ghosts remain
  
  We write scenarios matching these technical constraints!"

the-movie-question:
  cinematic-elements: |
    "Interactive games can move hearts through cinematic techniques.
    Zelda 64 has 90+ minutes of dedicated movies, but only 3 people
    worked on them initially, expanding to 6-7 during crunch."
  
  why-simple: |
    "Team energy is limited. My energy is limited. Instead of
    pre-rendered movies, we used that energy for interactive elements
    and polishing comfortable play."
  
  last-minute-changes: |
    "I changed scenarios just months before completion. Staff
    resisted throwing away work, but fixes took minimal time
    with our approach. And no - this wasn't because N64 lacks
    CD-ROM! This was philosophy."

nintendo-philosophy: |
  "President Yamauchi always says each product has a mission.
  We gave Zelda the mission of being truly interactive.
  This led to experiences no one had before."

future-direction:
  not-next-gen-zelda: |
    "Will we make Zelda for next-generation hardware?
    Currently, no."
    
    [Applause]
    
    "Most praised elements existed a year before release,
    but the game wasn't fun then. I don't think Zelda succeeded
    because of N64's expression power, auto-camera, auto-jump,
    new items, movies, or bosses."
  
  the-question: |
    "When hardware power increases, I expect better expression
    and response for Zelda. But what improves fun itself?
    I don't have that answer yet. Time to reconfirm what that is."

continuing-mission: |
  "We must continue creating new game ideas while addressing
  the manager's nightmare of ballooning development costs.
  We need new video game proposals that avoid this problem."

expanding-the-market: |
  "Games have spread to general audiences more than before.
  But we're still just creating small incidents in a special market.
  
  Zelda's impact on the world isn't like Super Mario Bros. was.
  We must deliver new appeal to the general public who haven't
  entered our industry yet."

entertainment-magic: |
  "One tiny idea can cause unexpected social phenomena.
  That's the fun of creating entertainment!"

new-experiments:
  talent-maker: |
    [Shows Game Boy Camera game where photos become dancing characters]
    
    "My opening video was made easily by staff using this tool!"
  
  peripheral-power: |
    "Game Boy Camera, Rumble Pak combinations create entirely
    new products. Japan already has Pokémon Stadium using GB Pak
    to play Pokémon in 3D. Hey You, Pikachu! uses microphone input.
    This year: Game Boy as N64 controller!"

the-tetris-reminder: |
  "While we made scrolling Mario games, someone created Tetris.
  While we discussed Mario 64's gorgeous pixels, Tamagotchi
  conquered the world with tiny dots. I thought Mario 64 lost
  to an egg!"

final-message: |
  "Game designers must be:
  1. Architects who understand technology
  2. Expressors of personal rhythm and individuality  
  3. Entertainers who make the world fun
  
  Let's design unique, attractive, fun software!
  Let's not let our world remain closed to a special few!
  Let's continue new challenges!
  And... let's make some money too!"
  
  [Laughter and thunderous applause]

legacy-quotes:
  - "I was one of the top 5 artists... because there were almost no artists!"
  - "My value is being on the frontier of interactive comfort"
  - "Lower Mario's jump by pixels - the game becomes completely different"
  - "Game-specific programming is only 1/4 of the work"
  - "Technology should support ideas from the shadows"
  - "One tiny idea can cause unexpected social phenomena"
  - "Mario 64 lost to an egg!"

impact: |
  This keynote established principles that would guide Nintendo and
  the industry for decades. Miyamoto's emphasis on technical grounding
  enabling creative freedom, rather than constraining it, revolutionized
  how developers thought about the designer-programmer relationship.
