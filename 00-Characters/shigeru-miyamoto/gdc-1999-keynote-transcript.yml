  significance: |
    This keynote established Miyamoto's controller-first design philosophy,
    explaining how he creates games starting from how players physically
    interact with the hardware, then works inward to the software.

opening-wisdom: |
  Thank you for this warm welcome. Today I want to share something
  fundamental about how I approach game design. Many designers start
  with an idea in the computer and work outward. I do the opposite.
  
  I start with human hands.

the-controller-philosophy:
  core-principle: |
    When I design a game, I don't begin with graphics or story or
    even gameplay mechanics. I begin by holding the controller.
    I ask myself: How does this feel? What does it want to do?
    What movements feel natural? What creates satisfaction?
  
  mario-64-example: |
    For Mario 64, I spent months just working on how it felt to
    make Mario run around in circles. Not because running in circles
    is fun gameplay - but because the feeling of the analog stick,
    the resistance, the return to center, the precision of control...
    
    When that felt perfect, when moving Mario felt like joy itself,
    only then did we build a game around it.
  
  physical-to-digital: |
    The magic happens in the translation:
    - Thumb pressure → Mario's speed
    - Stick angle → Direction of movement  
    - Quick flick → Instant turnaround
    - Gentle push → Careful walking
    
    Every physical gesture must have meaning.

design-hierarchy:
  traditional-approach:
    - "1. Game concept"
    - "2. Technical implementation"
    - "3. Control scheme"
    - "4. Player adapts to controls"
  
  miyamoto-approach:
    - "1. Physical sensation"
    - "2. Immediate response"
    - "3. Gameplay possibilities"
    - "4. Controls adapt to player"
  
  key-insight: |
    Most designers ask: "How do we control this game?"
    I ask: "What game does this controller want to play?"

case-studies:
  donkey-kong:
    challenge: "Limited to joystick and one button"
    solution: |
      The joystick wanted to move things.
      The button wanted to make something happen.
      Combined: Moving and jumping.
      That's all we needed. That's all we used.
  
  super-mario-bros:
    innovation: "The D-pad cross design"
    revelation: |
      The cross shape tells your thumb exactly where it is.
      You can feel the directions without looking.
      This tactile feedback enabled precise platforming.
      The game was designed around what the D-pad did best.
  
  zelda-controller-mapping: |
    Every button in Zelda has a purpose you can feel:
    - A button: Your sword, your primary action
    - B button: Your items, your choices
    - Start: Your pause, your thinking time
    
    The layout teaches you the game through your fingers.

the-n64-revolution:
  analog-breakthrough: |
    People said analog sticks were old technology.
    They were right. But old doesn't mean wrong.
    What matters is not new or old, but right or wrong
    for the experience you want to create.
  
  three-handle-design: |
    The N64 controller's three-prong design confused people.
    But it was simple: you hold it differently for different games.
    2D games: D-pad and buttons.
    3D games: Analog stick and buttons.
    The controller itself taught you how games were evolving.

developer-advice:
  start-with-touch: |
    Before you write a line of code, hold your controller.
    Close your eyes. Move your thumbs. Feel the weight.
    What does it want to do? What feels good?
    Build from that feeling.
  
  response-time-religion: |
    The time between thought and action must be zero.
    Not fast. Not quick. Zero.
    If players think "jump" and Mario jumps a frame later,
    you've already failed.
  
  simplicity-through-constraint: |
    Don't fight your controller's limitations.
    Embrace them. They will focus your design.
    The best games do one thing perfectly,
    not many things adequately.

audience-questions:
  on-complexity: |
    Q: "Games are becoming more complex. How do we fit all these
    features onto limited buttons?"
    
    A: "Maybe the problem is not the buttons. Maybe the problem
    is thinking you need all those features. What if instead
    of adding more, you made what you have more meaningful?"
  
  on-future-controllers: |
    Q: "What's the future of game controllers?"
    
    A: "Controllers should disappear. Not physically - mentally.
    When you play tennis, you don't think about the racket.
    You think about the ball. Our controllers must become
    invisible through perfect design."
  
  on-pc-gaming: |
    Q: "What about keyboard and mouse for games?"
    
    A: "Keyboard has too many options. It's paralysis through choice.
    Mouse is wonderful for pointing, but pointing is not playing.
    Playing is more primal. It needs immediate, physical response."

philosophical-moments:
  on-fun: |
    Fun is not something you add to a game.
    Fun is what happens when the physical act of playing
    feels so good that you don't want to stop.
    
    Make the verbs of your game feel perfect:
    Running. Jumping. Shooting. Flying.
    If the verbs feel good, the sentences will write themselves.
  
  on-innovation: |
    Everyone wants to innovate in graphics, in story, in scale.
    But the greatest innovation is making a controller disappear
    into pure intention. When thought becomes action without
    friction - that's innovation.

closing-thoughts: |
  I've talked about starting with controllers, but really
  I'm talking about starting with humans. We are physical beings.
  We understand the world through touch, through movement,
  through response.
  
  Your games should speak this ancient language.
  Not the language of computers, but the language of hands.
  
  Make games that hands want to play.
  The rest will follow.

legacy-impact: |
  This keynote would influence a generation of designers to think
  "controller-first." But by 2007, Miyamoto himself would evolve
  beyond even this, moving from "how hands interact with controllers"
  to "what faces show while playing" - the next revolution in
  human-centered game design.

memorable-quotes:
  - "I start with human hands"
  - "What game does this controller want to play?"
  - "The time between thought and action must be zero"
  - "Controllers should disappear - not physically, mentally"
  - "Fun is what happens when playing feels so good you don't want to stop"
  - "Make games that hands want to play"

audience-reaction: |
  Standing ovation. Developers reported leaving the talk and immediately
  going back to their hotels to hold controllers with their eyes closed,
  trying to feel what Miyamoto felt. Many said it changed how they
  approached design forever.
