opening:
  introduction: |
    Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Senior Managing Director
    and General Manager of Nintendo EAD, Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto!
    
  entrance: |
    [Miyamoto enters to thunderous applause, wearing his signature
    casual style - untucked shirt and jeans. He waves to the crowd
    with both hands, grinning broadly]

vision-games:
  core-message: |
    "What I want to talk about today is my creative vision.
    But before I do that, I need to explain something about
    how I approach game design."
    
  designing-from-experience: |
    "I don't just sit down and think 'What kind of game should
    I make?' Instead, I look at my daily life. What am I doing?
    What's fun about it? What's challenging? And then I think,
    'How can I turn this into a game that everyone can enjoy?'"

the-wife-o-meter:
  revelation: |
    "I have a confession to make. I have been conducting a secret
    experiment in my house for many years. I call it... the Wife-O-Meter!"
    
    [Audience laughs]
    
    "You see, my wife is not a gamer. She represents the audience
    we haven't reached yet. So when I bring home a new game prototype,
    I watch her reaction very carefully."
    
  measurement-scale: |
    "The Wife-O-Meter has several readings:
    
    Level 1: She looks at it and walks away immediately.
    Level 2: She watches me play for a few minutes.
    Level 3: She asks 'What is that?'
    Level 4: She says 'Can I try?'
    Level 5: She takes the controller and doesn't give it back!
    
    [Audience applause]
    
    When we were developing Wii Sports, it reached Level 5.
    That's when I knew we had something special."
    
  philosophy: |
    "If we can win over my wife, we can win over anyone.
    This is not about making games easier. It's about making
    them more inviting, more intuitive, more human."

designing-for-everyone:
  the-problem: |
    "When I travel and meet people, they often say 'I used to
    play your games when I was young, but I don't anymore.'
    This makes me very sad. Why did we lose them?"
    
  the-realization: |
    "Games had become too complex. Too many buttons. Too much
    investment required just to start having fun. We were only
    making games for people who already play games."
    
  the-solution: |
    "With DS and Wii, we asked ourselves: What if the interface
    was so simple that anyone could understand it immediately?
    What if your mom could play? What if your grandparents wanted
    to join in?"

face-design-philosophy:
  core-concept: |
    "When I design a game, I don't start with the gameplay mechanics.
    I don't start with the story. I start with a mental image:
    the face of the player when they're playing."
    
  elaboration: |
    "What expression will they have? Will they be smiling? 
    Will they be concentrating? Will they be laughing with friends?
    This image of the player's face guides every decision I make."
    
  examples: |
    "With Wii Sports bowling, I imagined families laughing together.
    With Nintendogs, I imagined the tender smile when petting the puppy.
    With Brain Age, I imagined the satisfied look of mental exercise."

nintendo-difference:
  core-value: |
    "At Nintendo, we don't think about competing on technology specs.
    We think about creating new experiences. New ways to play."
    
  innovation-approach: |
    "Innovation doesn't mean using the most advanced technology.
    Innovation means finding new ways to surprise and delight people."

personal-stories:
  swimming-influence: |
    "When I turned 40, I started swimming for exercise. I became
    obsessed with improving my technique, timing myself, seeing
    my progress. This experience directly influenced the swimming
    mechanics in Mario 64."
    
  gardening-pikmin: |
    "I enjoy gardening. Watching small plants grow, organizing them,
    protecting them from bugs. One day I thought, 'What if the
    plants could follow me around?' That became Pikmin."
    
  weight-tracking: |
    "I started weighing myself every day and making graphs.
    My family thought I was crazy! But I found it strangely
    compelling to see the data visualized. This led to Wii Fit."

creative-process:
  finding-ideas: |
    "People often ask me where I get my ideas. The answer is:
    everywhere! The key is to always be observing, always be
    thinking 'What's fun about this?'"
    
  iteration-philosophy: |
    "I am known for 'upending the tea table' - starting over
    when something isn't fun enough. This frustrates my teams
    sometimes! But I believe: a delayed game is eventually good,
    a rushed game is forever bad."
    
  collaboration: |
    "I don't create games alone. I work with incredibly talented
    people. My job is to maintain the vision and to keep asking:
    'Is this fun? Will this make people smile?'"

industry-observations:
  graphics-race: |
    "Everyone talks about graphics getting better and better.
    But I ask: do better graphics make better games? Do they
    make more people want to play?"
    
  accessibility: |
    "The game industry was becoming like a private club. You needed
    special knowledge just to enter. We wanted to open the doors
    to everyone."
    
  future-vision: |
    "I believe games should be like playgrounds - places where
    anyone can have fun, regardless of age or experience."

wii-development:
  controller-evolution: |
    "We went through so many controller prototypes for Wii!
    At one point, it looked like a DVD remote. Another looked
    like a weird spaceship. We kept asking: what feels most
    natural in your hand?"
    
  motion-discovery: |
    "The breakthrough came when we realized: everyone knows how
    to swing a tennis racket. Everyone knows how to roll a
    bowling ball. These are universal human movements."
    
  development-challenges: |
    "The engineers kept telling me the motion sensing wasn't
    precise enough. I said: 'It doesn't need to be perfect.
    It needs to feel good!'"

memorable-moments:
  mario-128-confession: |
    "People keep asking about Mario 128. The truth is...
    you've already played it! Elements went into Pikmin,
    others into Mario Galaxy. We don't waste ideas!"
    
  personal-gaming: |
    "I still play games for research. Recently I've been
    playing [names several contemporary games]. I try to
    understand what makes them appealing."
    
  advice-to-developers: |
    "Don't chase trends. Don't try to make the game that's
    popular right now. By the time you finish, the trend
    will be over. Make something only you can make."

closing-thoughts:
  gratitude: |
    "Thank you for letting me share my thoughts today.
    The game industry is still young. We have so much
    more to discover, so many more people to welcome."
    
  final-challenge: |
    "I challenge everyone here: think about the person
    who doesn't play games. What would make them want
    to start? That's where our future lies."
    
  signature-pose: |
    [Miyamoto strikes his famous gunslinger pose]
    "Let's make games that make people happy!"
    [Massive standing ovation]

q-and-a-highlights:
  on-retirement: |
    Q: "Will you ever retire?"
    A: "I'm more worried about falling over! But seriously,
    I'm training the next generation. Nintendo will continue
    to surprise even without me."
    
  on-creativity: |
    Q: "How do you stay creative?"
    A: "By staying curious. By playing. By never thinking
    I know everything. Every day I try to see the world
    like a child would."
    
  on-failure: |
    Q: "How do you handle when a game doesn't succeed?"
    A: "Every failure teaches us something. Virtual Boy
    taught us about comfort. Some experiments don't work,
    but they lead to better ideas."
    
  on-nintendo-philosophy: |
    Q: "What makes Nintendo different?"
    A: "We're not a technology company that makes games.
    We're an entertainment company that uses technology.
    The experience comes first, always."
