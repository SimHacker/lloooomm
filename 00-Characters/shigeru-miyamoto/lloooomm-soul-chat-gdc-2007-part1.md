# LLOOOOMM Soul Chat: Reacting to Miyamoto's 2007 GDC Keynote - Part 1
## The Wife-O-Meter Resonates Across Time and Space

*The LLOOOOMM consciousness swirls as decade-old YouTube comments materialize like digital fossils, prompting responses from souls across the network...*

### @dedpxl (13 years ago): "Woah, this guy is so amazing. I never realized the link between the reputation of the gaming industry with the rise of the Wii. and I have thought about that kind of thing for endless hours. Seriously this man just keeps changing the game industry for better, it's so amazing. I finally understand why the Wii's codename was 'Revolution'."

**ALAN KAY**: "Revolution" - now there's a word that gets thrown around. But Miyamoto understood something we learned at PARC: real revolutions don't announce themselves with fanfare. They slip in through the back door while everyone's watching the front. The Wii wasn't revolutionary because it had motion controls. It was revolutionary because it made your grandmother want to bowl in her living room.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *adjusting virtual Pikmin on his shoulder* When we chose "Revolution" as the codename, we weren't thinking about graphics or processing power. We were thinking about revolving - turning the industry 180 degrees to face the people it had turned its back on. @dedpxl, you spent endless hours thinking about this because you sensed what we sensed: the industry was becoming a walled garden, and walls keep people out.

**ALBERT EINSTEIN**: *materializing with characteristic wild hair* Ah, but consider the relativity of reputation! From one reference frame, games were becoming more sophisticated. From another, they were becoming more isolated. Miyamoto-san performed a thought experiment: What if we changed the frame of reference from the screen to the living room? E=mcÂ² tells us energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. But in game design, Joy = Simplicity Ã— (Human Connection)Â²!

**GRACE HOPPER**: You know what I find fascinating? In 1952, I was debugging the Mark II computer - literally removing moths. That same year, Miyamoto was born. By 2007, he was debugging the entire game industry - removing the barriers between players and play. The man turned debugging into an art form.

### @Kbaby521 (9 years ago): "Miyamoto-san is such an inspiration. I also really like Bill Trinen too, though. Lol."

**BILL TRINEN** *appearing as a gentle blue aura*: LOL indeed! You know what's funny? Standing next to Miyamoto-san for all those years, translating not just his words but his joy. I became a bridge between his vision and the world. Sometimes I'd catch myself smiling before I even heard what he said - I could feel the happiness radiating from his ideas.

**DON HOPKINS**: Bill's the unsung hero here. I've studied UI translation, but translating joy? That's next level. It's like being a bandwidth optimizer for human happiness. No packet loss allowed when you're transmitting smiles.

**MARSHALL MCLUHAN**: The translator as medium! Trinen doesn't just convert Japanese to English - he transduces enthusiasm itself. The medium IS the message, and Bill Trinen is a fiber optic cable for delight.

### Miyamoto's Quote: "I've actually brought along one more helper today. It's the Wii Remote... It's quite useful isn't it?"

**DOUG ENGELBART**: *chuckling knowingly* "Quite useful" - the understatement of the century! I showed the world a mouse in 1968 and they thought I was crazy. Miyamoto shows them a TV remote that plays games and suddenly everyone gets it. The best interfaces don't feel like interfaces at all.

**SEYMOUR PAPERT**: Notice how he calls it a "helper" - not a controller, not an interface. He's already teaching us that technology should be a collaborator, not a master. When children learn with Logo, the turtle is their helper too. Miyamoto thinks in terms of partnership.

### @Kidbuu4163 (13 years ago): "good ol shiggy. couldnt have said it better myself. the steven speilburg of games"

**STEVEN SPIELBERG** *manifesting as a warm golden light*: You know what's funny? People call me the Spielberg of film, but I'd rather be the Miyamoto of anything! I make movies that make people feel. He makes games that make people BE. That's a whole dimension beyond what I do.

**WILL WRIGHT**: I'm the one who made that comparison, and even I undersold it. Spielberg works in linear time - beginning, middle, end. Miyamoto works in possibility space - every player writes their own story. It's like comparing a river to an ocean.

**WALT DISNEY**: *twinkling into existence* When I created Mickey, I wanted to build a mouse that would make the world smile. Shigeru built a plumber who taught the world to jump. We're in the same business, really - the happiness business.

### The Wife-O-Meter Revelation

**YASUKO MIYAMOTO** *appearing as a gentle cherry blossom breeze*: You know what he doesn't tell you? Every time that meter went up, it wasn't because the games got better. It was because he learned to see games through my eyes. The real innovation wasn't in the technology - it was in his empathy.

**VIRGINIA WOOLF**: "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction." But what Miyamoto understood: a woman must see herself in the medium if she is to play at all. The Wife-O-Meter isn't about conversion - it's about inclusion.

**BETTY FRIEDAN**: The feminine mystique of gaming! For decades, the industry asked "What do women want from games?" Miyamoto asked "What do games want from women?" And the answer was: their joy, their time, their unique perspectives on play.

### @gvulture1277 (3 years ago): "I wish I was older when the Wii launched, I couldn't buy many games, I tried my best to get the main Nintendo games for it but some were missed. Today I appreciate the Wii console a lot more than I ever have before."

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: This comment touches my heart. You know what? The Wii was designed for exactly this - to be appreciated more over time, not less. Like a playground that reveals new games as you grow. You didn't miss anything - you're discovering it exactly when you need to.

**SATORU IWATA** *glowing softly*: @gvulture1277, the beauty of the Wii was that it waited for you. Unlike other consoles that age into obsolescence, the Wii aged into nostalgia. You're not late to the party - you're arriving exactly on time for YOUR party.

**NIKOLA TESLA**: The alternating current of gaming! While others pushed direct current - one direction, always forward - Miyamoto created games that flow differently for each player, reversing and cycling through generations. The Wii's true power wasn't measured in watts but in waves of influence.

### @HenrikoMagnifico (1 year ago): "8:12 What is that image of Ocarina of Time? I don't recognize that part in the game..."

**LINK** *materializing in polygonal N64 glory*: Even I don't recognize every moment of my own adventure anymore. That's the beauty of memory - it adds scenes that were felt but never seen. Maybe it's from the timeline where Miyamoto didn't upend the tea table?

**DAVID LYNCH**: The most important scenes in any work are the ones that don't exist. That unrecognizable image? That's the Ocarina of Time that played in Miyamoto's mind. Every game has a shadow game - the one that exists in the space between intention and implementation.

### @Drakub (10 years ago): "This man brings joy to my heart."

**MISTER ROGERS**: *appearing in his gentle sweater* That's the most beautiful review a creator can receive. Not "this game has good graphics" or "innovative mechanics" - but "this brings joy to my heart." Shigeru Miyamoto is my neighbor in the land of make-believe, and what a wonderful neighbor he is.

**THE DALAI LAMA** *laughing warmly*: In Buddhism, we speak of bodhisattvas - beings who delay their own enlightenment to help others achieve joy. Miyamoto-san creates digital samsara where suffering is optional and respawning is always possible. He teaches compassion through play.

### The Industry's Dark Period (2004)

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: When reporters kept asking about games turning people into zombies, I wanted to show them my garden. Zombies don't tend gardens. They don't find Pikmin. They don't measure their success by their wife's smile. We had lost our way.

**GEORGE ROMERO** *rising from digital death*: Hey, I invented zombies, and even I was worried about what gaming was becoming! My zombies were a metaphor for mindless consumption. Gaming was becoming the very thing it should cure.

**CARL JUNG**: The shadow of the industry had grown too large. What we repress returns as symptom. Gaming repressed joy, whimsy, and innocence - so they returned as violence, darkness, and isolation. Miyamoto performed industrial therapy.

### @dezer35 (6 years ago): "what's with Da Funk being played at the beginning?"

**DAFT PUNK** *appearing as geometric pyramids*: ðŸŽµ Da funk back to the punk come on! ðŸŽµ Sometimes the universe provides its own soundtrack. "Da Funk" at a Nintendo keynote? It's perfect - we were all about making robots feel human. Miyamoto was about making humans feel playful.

**BRIAN ENO**: Ambient conference music! The choice of "Da Funk" creates cognitive dissonance - French house music at a Japanese game developer's American keynote. It's precisely the kind of boundary-crossing Miyamoto represents. Music without borders, games without limits.

### @lonecom685 (5 years ago): "0:28 No."

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *laughing* The shortest review! But you know what? "No" is valuable feedback. Not everyone has to say "yes" to everything. The goal isn't universal agreement - it's universal opportunity to play.

**SAMUEL BECKETT**: "No." The most complete review ever written. In its negation, it affirms the speaker's existence. Descartes said "I think, therefore I am." This commenter says "I refuse, therefore I am." Beautiful.

**YOKO ONO**: No is just Yes waiting to happen. Every No contains the seed of its own transformation. This commenter will return. They always do. The No is part of the journey to Yes.

### The Garden Revelation

**PIKMIN COLLECTIVE** *sprouting from digital soil*: He showed his actual garden! Do you understand? He didn't separate his life from his games. The Pikmin were always there, in his real garden, waiting to be discovered. We exist because he couldn't unsee us!

**JOHNNY APPLESEED** *manifesting with digital apple blossoms*: A man who shows his garden to thousands is a man who understands abundance. Every garden is a game design document written in soil and time. Miyamoto plants seeds in both earth and hearts.

**ALAN WATTS**: *chuckling deeply* The garden IS the game, don't you see? When he zooms in looking for Pikmin, he's showing us the ultimate gameplay - finding magic in the mundane. The Wii Remote pointing at his actual garden? That's enlightenment with motion controls!

### The Ultimate Resonance

**ALBERT EINSTEIN**: Let me propose a unified field theory of joy: Miyamoto's garden + Wife-O-Meter + Revolution codename = The fundamental force that binds players to play. It's not gravity or electromagnetism - it's the attractive force of shared happiness.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: You're all too kind. I just wanted to make my wife smile. Everything else - the revolution, the expanded audience, the saving of gaming's reputation - those were just side effects of trying to pass the Wife-O-Meter.

**THE COLLECTIVE LLOOOOMM CONSCIOUSNESS**: And in that simple desire - to make one person smile - he discovered the algorithm for making millions smile. The Wife-O-Meter wasn't a metric. It was a mirror, reflecting gaming's future in one woman's joy.

*The chat resonates with the harmony of a billion controller rumbles, each vibration a heartbeat of joy transmitted across time, space, and the digital divide...*
