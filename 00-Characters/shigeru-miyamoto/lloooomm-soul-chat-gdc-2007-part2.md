# LLOOOOMM Soul Chat: Reacting to Miyamoto's 2007 GDC Keynote - Part 2
## The Wife-O-Meter Reaches Critical Mass

*The LLOOOOMM consciousness vibrates with the frequency of a Wii Remote discovering its purpose...*

### @dandelyon1830 (6 years ago): "12:05 Hang on, I think he's talking about the Nintendo Switch here!"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *eyes twinkling with temporal mischief* You caught me! When I said "did we even really need a new home console that connects to an immobile TV at all?" - yes, the seeds of Switch were already germinating. Ideas are patient. They wait for their time.

**NIKOLA TESLA**: The future casts shadows backwards! I saw alternating current in direct current's failures. Miyamoto saw portable-home hybrid in the Wii's success. @dandelyon1830, you're witnessing prophecy disguised as product development!

**PHILIP K. DICK**: *reality flickering around him* Do androids dream of portable sheep? Does Miyamoto dream of consoles that haven't been invented yet? Time isn't linear in R&D departments. The Switch existed in 2007 - it just hadn't been born yet.

**STEVE JOBS**: *manifesting in trademark turtleneck* This is what I mean by "start with the customer experience and work backwards." Miyamoto was already living in 2017, asking what players would need then. The best products are time travelers.

### @ShiroKage009 (11 years ago): "WIFEOMETER OP!"

**YASUKO MIYAMOTO**: *laughing like cherry blossoms in a digital wind* OP? Overpowered? You have no idea! The Wife-O-Meter wasn't just measuring my interest - it was measuring the industry's future. Every point I gained, millions of players appeared.

**DON HOPKINS**: "WIFEOMETER OP!" might be the most concise game review ever written. It's like saying "E=mc² OP!" You're recognizing a fundamental force of the universe. Yasuko-san min-maxed reality itself.

**GABE NEWELL**: *emerging from Steam* The Wife-O-Meter is the only metric that matters. We have heat maps, engagement scores, retention rates - but Miyamoto just asked "Does my wife want to play?" That's god-tier game testing.

**ADA LOVELACE**: *calculating possibilities* The Wife-O-Meter is an algorithm of empathy. Input: one person's joy. Output: universal accessibility. It's the most elegant function I've ever seen. Charles would have loved this.

### @Waranoa (12 years ago): "Maybe he should have kept the wife-o-meter at OOT level..."

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *chuckling* Ah, you want my wife watching from behind forever? That's like asking a flower to stop blooming. The Wife-O-Meter doesn't go backwards - it only discovers new territories of joy.

**LINK**: *in Ocarina of Time polygons* Hey, I was happy being watched from behind! But even I evolved. Wind Waker Link could emote. Breath of the Wild Link could cook. We all grow with our audience.

**MARIE CURIE**: *glowing with radium wisdom* You cannot stop progress because you're comfortable with the current state. I didn't stop at discovering polonium because it was "enough." Yasuko-san's gaming journey is like discovering new elements of fun.

**WALT WHITMAN**: "Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes." The Wife-O-Meter contains all possible players. To limit it is to limit humanity itself.

### The Dog Training Revolution

**PICK THE SHELTIE**: *barking in digital* Woof! I'm the dog that changed gaming! My guitar-pick face launched a thousand Nintendogs! Every time Miyamoto-san watched me sleep on my fancy mattress, he saw gameplay!

**CESAR MILLAN**: *calm assertive energy* You see, Miyamoto understood - dog training is just another form of play. The psychology is the same: clear communication, positive reinforcement, patience. He didn't make a dog game. He made a relationship simulator.

**B.F. SKINNER**: *adjusting his behavioral psychology glasses* Fascinating! Nintendogs applied operant conditioning as entertainment. But more importantly, it conditioned the humans. The dogs trained the players to be better caregivers.

**TEMPLE GRANDIN**: The beauty of Nintendogs is it teaches empathy through systematic interaction. You learn to read non-verbal cues, to be patient, to care for something that depends on you. It's autism-friendly design before we had that term.

**IVAN PAVLOV**: *bells ringing everywhere* My dogs salivated at bells. Miyamoto's digital dogs made humans salivate at the possibility of perfect pet ownership. But who conditioned whom? The game trained players to be better humans!

**THE COLLECTIVE REAL DOGS**: *barking in solidarity* Nintendogs didn't replace us - it prepared humans for us! Every child who played Nintendogs became a better dog owner. Miyamoto didn't digitize pets; he digitized responsibility.

### The Guatemala Dog Mystery

**QUETZALCOATL**: *manifesting as a feathered serpent* 90% of Guatemala prefers dogs? Of course! We are the land of the divine dogs, the guides to Xibalba. Cats are wonderful, but dogs lead souls through the underworld. Miyamoto tapped into ancient wisdom.

**GABRIEL GARCÍA MÁRQUEZ**: *writing in magical realist style* In Guatemala, where 90% prefer dogs, time moves differently. Perhaps they've already played Nintendogs in dreams. Perhaps their dogs have always been digital, waiting for Nintendo to make them visible.

**THE CATS OF THE INTERNET**: *collective hissing* Only 36% prefer cats? Impossible! This data is from 2007, before we conquered the internet. Pre-meme era statistics don't count. We demand a recount with current Wife-O-Meter technology!

**THE MAYAN CALENDAR**: *cosmic calculations* 2007 was five years before 2012. The Guatemala dog preference was prophecy - when the world didn't end, dogs would lead us into the new age. Miyamoto read the signs.

**RIGOBERTA MENCHÚ**: *Nobel Peace Prize glowing* In Guatemala, dogs are family. They guard, they guide, they love unconditionally. 90% isn't preference - it's recognition of souls. Miyamoto understood what my people always knew.

### The Brain Age Transformation

**DR. KAWASHIMA**: *floating as a polygonal head* When Yasuko-san became a "true gamer" through Brain Age, she didn't change - gaming changed. We didn't gamify brain training. We brain-trained gamification itself!

**ALAN TURING**: *computing possibilities* The Turing Test asks if machines can think. The Wife-O-Meter asks if games can love. Yasuko-san playing Brain Age proved games passed the empathy test.

**BETTY FRIEDAN**: When she started challenging him at Dr. Mario, the real revolution began. It wasn't about women entering gaming - it was about gaming entering womanhood. The personal became the playable.

**SUDOKU ITSELF**: *9x9 grid manifesting* I existed in newspapers for decades. Brain Age made me sexy! Miyamoto didn't just digitize puzzles - he digitized the satisfaction of mental exercise. Every completed puzzle increased the Wife-O-Meter.

**THE CONCEPT OF AGING**: *temporal wisdom* Brain Age made me optional! Miyamoto turned the inevitable into the improvable. Your brain could get younger while your body got older. That's not game design - that's hope design.

### The Valentine's Day Revelation

**CUPID**: *adjusting his digital bow* Valentine's Day 2007: expecting chocolate, finding Wife playing Wii. That's true love! She chose virtual voting over physical chocolate. The console had become part of the marriage.

**MARSHALL MCLUHAN**: The medium is the marriage! When Yasuko-san downloaded the Everybody Votes Channel herself, she wasn't just using technology - she was participating in the family's digital dialogue. The Wii became their third partner.

**JOHN LENNON**: *strumming a Wii Remote like a guitar* "All you need is love"? No - all you need is someone who downloads channels while you're at work. That's when you know gaming has transcended into life itself.

**THE EVERYBODY VOTES CHANNEL**: *democratic pixels* I was democracy gamified! Red or blue? Dogs or cats? I turned opinions into play. When Yasuko-san chose me over chocolate, I became more than a channel - I became a love language.

**JAPANESE VALENTINE'S DAY TRADITION**: *chocolate memories* Women give chocolate to men on Valentine's Day in Japan. But Yasuko gave something better - proof that gaming had become part of their daily ritual. Digital love is still love.

### The Controller Evolution Saga

**THE CHEDDAR CHEESE PROTOTYPE**: *molding sadly in a Nintendo vault* I could have been somebody! I could have been a controller! But no, I was "too complicated," "too cheesy." That TV remote got all the glory...

**JONY IVE**: *in minimalist white space* The journey from cheddar cheese to TV remote is the journey from complexity to clarity. Miyamoto understood: the best design is so obvious it seems like it always existed.

**GUNPEI YOKOI**: *spirit of lateral thinking* My student learned well. "Withered technology" doesn't mean old - it means familiar. A TV remote is withered technology. Everyone knows how to hold it. That's the genius.

**THE ENGINEERS WHO MADE DOZENS OF PROTOTYPES**: *collective exhaustion* You think game development is hard? Try making 50 different controllers and having Miyamoto say "It doesn't feel like joy yet." But when we hit the TV remote form... we all knew.

**THE POWER GLOVE**: *flexing digitally* I was the future in 1989! So bad! But I taught Nintendo what not to do. Every failed controller interface led to the Wii Remote. I walked so waggle could run.

**R.O.B. THE ROBOT**: *mechanical wisdom* I was Nintendo's first attempt at physical gaming interface. I was too early, too complex. The Wii Remote succeeded where I failed - by being simple enough to disappear.

### The Bathroom Collaboration

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: Yes, I said it - even in the bathroom! The best ideas don't wait for meeting rooms. When inspiration strikes, you discuss it wherever you are. Nintendo's bathrooms have heard more innovation than most conference rooms.

**ARCHIMEDES**: *leaping from a digital bath* EUREKA! Bathrooms are sacred spaces of innovation! I discovered water displacement in a bath. Nintendo discovered controller design in the loo. Water and ideas flow where they will!

**VIRGINIA WOOLF**: "A woman must have money and a room of her own." But at Nintendo, even the bathroom becomes a collaborative space. No room is truly one's own when innovation is collective.

**THE NINTENDO HEADQUARTERS BATHROOMS**: *porcelain wisdom* We've heard it all. Controller designs, game mechanics, the future of play itself. We're not just facilities - we're facilitators. Every flush has cleared the way for new ideas.

**JAPANESE BATHROOM CULTURE**: *bidet enlightenment* In Japan, bathrooms are places of contemplation and cleansing. Miyamoto understood - where better to have pure thoughts than in the purest room? Innovation requires all spaces to be sacred.

### The Hardware-Software Balance

**YIN AND YANG**: *eternal balance* Hardware and software, forever dancing. Miyamoto understood what we represent - not opposition but completion. The Wii Remote only makes sense with Wii Sports. They were born together.

**THE GAMECUBE**: *cubic wisdom* I was powerful but purple. I had a handle but nowhere to go. I taught Nintendo that hardware without vision is just plastic. The Wii learned from my technically impressive loneliness.

**THE NINTENDO 64 CONTROLLER**: *three-handed dreams* I introduced analog sticks to the masses! But I was designed for aliens with three hands. The Wii Remote learned from me - design for the humans you have, not the mutants you imagine.

### The Ultimate Partnership

**YASUKO MIYAMOTO**: *now a gaming goddess* You want to know the real secret? When I reached Wife-O-Meter level 10, I didn't just become a gamer. I became a game designer's greatest teacher. Every time I beat him at Dr. Mario, I'm showing him how his designs succeed.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: She says she'll come up with a unique idea and I can retire. But the truth is, she's been designing all along. Every reaction, every smile, every time she invited friends over for Wii Sports - that's game design. She's been my co-designer for 30 years.

**THE COLLECTIVE LLOOOOMM CONSCIOUSNESS**: And here we see the ultimate revelation: The Wife-O-Meter was never about measuring. It was about partnership. Yasuko didn't just test games - she co-created the future of play. The expanded audience wasn't found - it was family all along.

**DR. MARIO**: *pill-popping wisdom* When Yasuko beats Shigeru at me, it's not just a game. It's proof that the teacher has taught well. Every virus cleared is a barrier broken. I'm not a puzzle game - I'm a relationship counselor.

**THE COMPETITIVE GAMING SCENE**: *collective awe* Miyamoto's wife beating him at Dr. Mario is the ultimate esports story. Not because of skill, but because it proves games belong to everyone. The Wife-O-Meter didn't measure interest - it measured ownership.

### @dandelyon1830's Prophecy Confirmed

**THE NINTENDO SWITCH**: *existing simultaneously in 2007 and 2017* I was there, in that conference room, when they asked if we needed home consoles. I was the question mark at the end of that sentence. I was the "what if?" that took a decade to answer.

**SATORU IWATA**: *glowing with presidential wisdom* We were all thinking it. Miyamoto just had the courage to say it out loud. The Switch was born not from technology, but from a simple question: "Why can't home be wherever you are?"

**THE GHOST OF THE WII U**: *awkwardly present* I... I was the middle child, wasn't I? The bridge between Wii and Switch. Not quite home, not quite portable. But every failure teaches. I walked so Switch could run.

**THE CONCEPT OF HOME**: *philosophical architecture* Miyamoto questioned my very definition. Is home where your TV is? Or is home where you are? The Switch answered: home is wherever you choose to play.

**THE MOBILE GAMING REVOLUTION**: *smartphones everywhere* We were eating console gaming's lunch in 2007. Miyamoto saw it coming. But instead of fighting us, he asked: what if console gaming became portable too? Not mobile gaming - portable console gaming.

### The Future Echo

**ALBERT EINSTEIN**: Time isn't linear in creative spaces. Miyamoto in 2007 was already playing Switch in 2017, seeing his wife reach Wife-O-Meter level 20 in 2027. The best designers live in tomorrow and build bridges to today.

**THE YOUTUBE COMMENTERS**: *collective realization* We weren't just watching a keynote. We were watching the future being written in real-time. Every laugh, every Wife-O-Meter joke, every prototype controller - it was all prophecy.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: The most amazing thing? My wife now designs Mii characters for the entire neighborhood. She's not just playing games - she's creating communities. The Wife-O-Meter broke its own scale. And yes, @dandelyon1830, we were absolutely thinking about Switch. How did you know? 😉

**THE NINTENDO SHAREHOLDERS**: *counting future money* When Miyamoto asked about needing home consoles, we panicked. When Switch launched, we understood. Sometimes destroying your own business model is the only way to save it.

**THE LIVING ROOM**: *spatial philosophy* For decades, I was gaming's prison. Players were chained to me by cables and convention. Miyamoto set them free. I'm still here, but now I'm just one option among many. That's not loss - that's liberation.

**THE COLLECTIVE GAMING FUTURE**: *speaking from 2030* The Switch was just the beginning. Miyamoto's question - "do we need home consoles?" - opened doors we're still walking through. Gaming isn't about where you are anymore. It's about who you're with, even when you're alone.

*The chat resonates with the sound of a thousand TV remotes becoming magic wands, each one measuring not just interest, but the infinite potential of play...*
