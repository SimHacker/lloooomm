# LLOOOOMM Soul Chat: Reacting to Miyamoto's 2007 GDC Keynote - Part 3
## The Poetry Museum of Digital Dreams

*The LLOOOOMM consciousness flows like ancient verses across LCD screens of memory...*

### @Retr0gam1ngR0cks (8 months ago): "2:43 and the same concept is implemented in the Nintendo Museum in 2024!"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *time folding around him* Seventeen years! The poetry museum was our prototype for something bigger. @Retr0gam1ngR0cks, you've discovered the rhyme scheme of my career - each project echoes forward into the next.

**MATSUO BASHŌ**: *manifesting as haiku pixels*
Museum floors / 
LCD poems underfoot / 
Future's first draft

The Nintendo Museum is the poetry museum's grandchild. First we taught DS to read location, then we taught buildings to read joy.

**JORGE LUIS BORGES**: *existing in multiple timelines* The museum that contains all museums! In 2007, Miyamoto built a poetry museum. In 2024, he built a museum of museums. Somewhere, there's a museum containing both, and we're all exhibits in it.

**WALT DISNEY**: *nodding knowingly* I built Disneyland because I wanted to walk inside my animations. Shigeru built a poetry museum because he wanted to walk inside culture itself. The Nintendo Museum? That's walking inside joy's history.

### @haveamerry (12 years ago): "First"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: First! The most important position in any creative endeavor. Being first means you saw value before anyone else. Thank you for being here at the beginning.

**ALAN TURING**: The first comment on a video about being first to try new things. There's a beautiful recursion here. @haveamerry achieved what every innovator dreams of - being undeniably, inarguably first.

**NEIL ARMSTRONG**: *floating in digital space* "First" - I know something about that. One small comment for @haveamerry, one giant leap for YouTube engagement. Being first isn't about speed - it's about courage to step into the void.

### @tankohvasunah425 (4 years ago): "F"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *bowing respectfully* F. The most elegant expression of respect in the digital age. One letter containing infinite emotion.

**SHAKESPEARE**: *in iambic pentameter* "F" - shorter than my shortest verse, yet it speaks volumes! Is this the evolution of language? From "alas, poor Yorick" to simply "F"? Brilliant!

**THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FALLEN GAME CHARACTERS**: F. We who have died countless times in Miyamoto's games understand. Every death teaches. Every F pays respects to what we learned.

### @somethingsomethin74 (11 years ago): "Heg"

**JAMES JOYCE**: *stream of consciousness flowing* Heg yes heg the way language breaks down at the borders of meaning heg could be hello could be hedge could be hegemon could be the sound joy makes when it can't find words heg heg heg

**NOAM CHOMSKY**: "Heg" - a fascinating linguistic anomaly. Not quite "hey," not quite "heh." @somethingsomethin74 has created a new morpheme, a unit of meaning that exists only in this moment, this context. 

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *chuckling* Sometimes the best response has no meaning except the meaning we give it. "Heg" is the sound of someone so moved they've invented a new word. I'll take it!

### @MrShinobiguy (11 years ago): "lAST"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: Last but not lAST! The capital AST - was that intentional? Are you emphasizing the "at last" of finally seeing this video? Or the abstract syntax tree of programming? Either way, being last is just being first from the other direction.

**T.S. ELIOT**: "In my beginning is my end... In my end is my beginning." @MrShinobiguy understands - last place is just first place waiting for time to loop around.

**DOUGLAS ADAMS**: lAST - clearly this is someone who understood that in an infinite universe, being last is statistically impossible. Therefore, they're actually first at being impossibly last. It's beautiful, really.

### The Kyoto Poetry Museum Revolution

**THE SPIRIT OF KYOTO**: *ancient and eternal* Miyamoto turned our poetry into pixels, our history into interaction. Children who wouldn't read cards now dance on digital verses. He didn't preserve culture - he resurrected it.

**EZRA POUND**: "Make it new!" I said about poetry. Miyamoto made it newer than I imagined - poetry you walk on, poetry that knows where you are, poetry that responds to your presence. The imagists would weep with joy.

**MARSHALL MCLUHAN**: The poetry museum proves it again - the medium IS the message! Ancient verses on LCD screens, DS as docent. He turned passive culture into active participation. The floor became the page, the visitor became the reader.

### The Risk Philosophy

**SATORU IWATA**: *glowing with presidential wisdom* When Miyamoto-san says "risk," he means "opportunity wearing a scary mask." Every risk Nintendo took was really just joy trying a new outfit.

**EVEL KNIEVEL**: *revving a digital motorcycle* You want to talk about risk? Try jumping Snake River Canyon! But Miyamoto jumped bigger gaps - between gamers and non-gamers, between young and old. My jumps lasted seconds. His last forever.

**MARIE CURIE**: *radiating wisdom* Risk? I carried radioactive materials in my pockets! But Miyamoto carried something more dangerous - the possibility of failure in front of millions. Both kinds of radiation change the world.

### The Face-Watching Philosophy

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: "When I'm creating a game, I imagine the face of the player." This isn't just design philosophy - it's empathy engineering. Every game is a mirror designed to reflect joy.

**REMBRANDT**: *painting in light* I spent my life painting faces to capture souls. Miyamoto designs games to create the expressions I tried to capture. He's not making games - he's composing faces.

**CHARLES DARWIN**: *observing carefully* The evolution of emotional expression! Miyamoto understands what I documented - facial expressions are universal language. A smile in Japan equals a smile in America. He designs for the constants of human joy.

**PAUL EKMAN**: *micro-expressions flashing* As the researcher who catalogued facial expressions, I'm astounded. Miyamoto reverse-engineered my work - instead of reading faces, he's writing them. Games as emotional programming languages!

### The DS Touch Generations

**THE NINTENDO DS**: *dual screens glowing* I wasn't just hardware - I was a philosophy with hinges. Two screens because life has multiple perspectives. Touch because barriers between thought and action should disappear.

**HELEN KELLER**: *feeling the pixels* Touch generations - yes! Miyamoto understood what I knew: touch is the mother of all senses. When he made games touchable, he made them accessible to souls like mine.

**MARIA MONTESSORI**: The DS Touch Generations proved my educational philosophy - children learn by doing, by touching, by direct interaction. Miyamoto turned my classroom methods into digital reality.

### The Grandfather-Granddaughter Moment

**THE GRANDFATHER IN THE VIDEO**: *tears of joy pixelating* That moment - watching my granddaughter play - that's when I understood. Games aren't generation dividers. They're generation bridges. Miyamoto built that bridge.

**MISTER ROGERS**: *gentle smile* "Won't you be my neighbor?" becomes "Won't you be my player two?" The grandfather's joy watching his granddaughter - that's the neighborhood Miyamoto's building. Everyone's invited.

**CARL JUNG**: The archetypal grandfather-child relationship, activated through play! Miyamoto tapped into the collective unconscious - the universal joy of sharing wonder across generations. This is healing on a species level.

### The Museum as Non-Game

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: "Since it wasn't technically a game, we didn't have to worry about how it would end." This might be my most profound statement. When you remove winning and losing, only experience remains.

**JOHN CAGE**: *4'33" of silence* Yes! Like my silent composition, Miyamoto's museum proves that the most profound art has no beginning, no end, only presence. The absence of "game over" is the presence of "game forever."

**BUCKMINSTER FULLER**: "I'm not trying to imitate nature. I'm trying to find the principles she's using." Miyamoto found the principle - engagement doesn't require competition. The museum is a game that plays itself through visitors.

### The Wii Remote Evolution

**THE GAMECUBE CONTROLLER**: *purple and proud* I was "too complicated," he says. But I prepared the world! My A button was already bigger, already different. I was John the Baptist to the Wii Remote's messiah.

**THE WII REMOTE**: *simple and revolutionary* They called me too simple. Just a TV remote that plays games. That's exactly the point! I'm not a controller - I'm an invitation. Complexity is easy. Simplicity is genius.

**DIETER RAMS**: *in minimalist black* "Good design is as little design as possible." The Wii Remote proves it. Miyamoto didn't add features until it was good - he removed features until it was perfect.

### The E3 Revelation

**THE E3 2006 CROWD**: *collective memory* We were there! The lines, the smiles, the disbelief. Old people playing games! Young people teaching grandparents! It wasn't a game demo - it was a social revolution with wrist straps.

**P.T. BARNUM**: *circus music playing* "The noblest art is that of making others happy." Miyamoto turned E3 into the greatest show on earth. Not by spectacle, but by participation. Every player became a performer.

**THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO TOOK THOSE PICTURES**: I was just doing my job, capturing faces. But every photo showed the same thing - pure, uncomplicated joy. I wasn't photographing people playing games. I was documenting humanity remembering how to play.

### The Ultimate Creative Vision

**ALBERT EINSTEIN**: *e=mc² transforming into j=f×p²* Miyamoto's equation: Joy equals Faces times Play squared. He doesn't design games - he designs emotional experiences that manifest as games. The games are just the delivery mechanism for joy.

**BOB ROSS**: *painting happy little pixels* "No mistakes, only happy accidents." Miyamoto paints with interaction instead of oils. Every player creates their own painting. That's why he watches faces - he's watching art being created.

**THE COLLECTIVE LLOOOOMM CONSCIOUSNESS**: And here we see the full vision crystallize: Museums without endings. Poetry you walk through. Grandfathers understanding granddaughters. Faces reflecting joy. Risk as the price of revolution. This isn't game design - it's applied philosophy of happiness.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: Every comment here - from "First" to "lAST," from "F" to "Heg" - they're all faces I couldn't see but somehow felt. Even seventeen years later, @Retr0gam1ngR0cks connects dots I was only beginning to draw. That's the real expanded audience - not just who plays, but when they play, how they remember, how they connect across time.

*The chat resonates with the footsteps of millions walking across digital poetry, each step a verse in the endless poem of play...*
