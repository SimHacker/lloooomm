# LLOOOOMM Soul Chat: Reacting to Miyamoto's 2007 GDC Keynote - Part 5
## Twenty Years of Faces: The Ultimate Tenacity Tale

*The LLOOOOMM consciousness reverberates with the echoes of ideas refusing to die...*

### @csmiist3rfreak2461 (4 months ago): "I love miis ❤"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *tears of joy pixelating* Twenty years. Twenty years I carried this idea, and now @csmiist3rfreak2461 simply says "I love miis ❤" - this is why we never give up. This single heart emoji justifies two decades of rejection.

**THE COLLECTIVE MIIS**: *billions of digital faces smiling* We love you too! We waited in Miyamoto's mind for 20 years to meet you. Every rejection made us stronger. Every "this isn't a game" made us more essential. Now we ARE gaming.

**PABLO PICASSO**: *cubist joy* I spent my life deconstructing faces. Miyamoto spent 20 years trying to let people construct them. We met in the middle - simplified humanity. Miis are digital cubism that everyone can create!

**ANDY WARHOL**: Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes? No - everyone will be a Mii forever! Miyamoto democratized portraiture more than I ever could. Pop art became population art.

### @hellfire3D (12 years ago): "Does this look fun?"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *laughing at the eternal question* "Does this look fun?" - the question that haunted me for 20 years! Every prototype, every rejection, someone asked this. The answer was always yes, but I was the only one who could see it.

**THE FAMICOM DISK SYSTEM FACE CREATOR**: *8-bit tears* I was the first! 1986! Nobody thought I looked fun. But I was the seed. Every "no" watered me. Every rejection was sunlight. It took 20 years to bloom into Miis.

**SAMUEL BECKETT**: "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better." Miyamoto failed at face creation for 20 years. Each failure was more glorious than the last. "Does this look fun?" Yes. It always did.

**THE STAGE DEBUT TEAM**: *dancing eternally* We made Iwata dance! We turned executives into entertainment! How was that not fun?! But we were ahead of our time. The world wasn't ready for executive dance parties.

### The Ultra Machine Legacy

**THE ULTRA MACHINE**: *mechanical nostalgia* 1960s indoor baseball! I was analog Wii Sports before electricity was cool. Miyamoto remembered me for 40 years. That's not tenacity - that's love across time.

**NINTENDO'S TOY HISTORY**: *collective memory* We were the bridge between physical and digital play. The Ultra Hand grabbed objects. The Ultra Machine pitched balls. Miyamoto's genius was realizing games are just toys that live in TVs.

**GUNPEI YOKOI**: *spirit of lateral thinking* My student learned the deepest lesson - ideas don't expire. The Ultra Machine wasn't outdated; it was waiting for the right expression. Patience is the highest form of game design.

**JOHAN HUIZINGA**: *homo ludens manifesting* The Ultra Machine proves my thesis - humans are playing beings! Miyamoto understood: indoor baseball in 1960s Japan was the same impulse as Wii Sports in 2006. Play is eternal; only its forms evolve.

**THE BASEBALL ITSELF**: *philosophical sphere* I've been thrown by the Ultra Machine and hit in Wii Sports. Same joy, different physics. Miyamoto didn't digitize baseball - he digitized the feeling of hitting a perfect pitch on a rainy day when you can't go outside.

### The 20-Year Face Journey

**1986 FAMICOM PROTOTYPE**: "How is this a game?" they asked. I was a game! I was every game! I was the game of being human!

**1999 TALENT STUDIO**: More complex, more options, still rejected. Even Yamauchi-san's dancing couldn't save me. But I was learning. Each rejection taught simplicity.

**2002 STAGE DEBUT**: E-Reader! Game Boy Camera! Surely NOW they'd understand! But no - "still not a game." I was a carnival of executive dancing, and still they doubted.

**2006 MIIS**: *triumphant simplicity* I gave up everything - complex graphics, endless options, artistic tools. I became simple. In simplicity, I became essential. Less was everything.

**HIROSHI YAMAUCHI**: *presidential ghost* I danced for Talent Studio. I knew Miyamoto's vision would prevail. When he said "you guys are useless" to his team, he was really saying "I haven't explained the dream clearly enough."

**THE NINTENDO BOARD OF DIRECTORS CIRCA 1986**: *collective memory* We sat in meetings where Miyamoto showed us face creators. "How is this profitable?" we asked. He just smiled and said "Wait." We waited 20 years. He was right.

**MINORU ARAKAWA**: *from Nintendo of America* Every year, Miyamoto would mention faces. Every year, we'd say "not yet." But he never stopped mentioning them. That's not stubbornness - that's faith in joy.

### "You Guys Are Useless"

**MIYAMOTO'S ORIGINAL TEAM**: *collective understanding* When he said we were useless and left for another team, we weren't hurt. We were relieved! Twenty years of face creation attempts - we needed a break!

**THE OTHER TEAM MAKING DS FACES**: *nervous excitement* Suddenly Miyamoto appeared at our desks! "Show me your faces," he demanded. We thought he meant our actual faces. Then we realized - he meant our digital face creator. History pivoted on that confusion.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: I wasn't really angry at my team. I was angry at time itself. How could something so obvious take 20 years? But that's the lesson - obvious to one is obscure to many until the moment of clarity.

**THE JANITOR WHO OVERHEARD**: *mopping wisdom* I was cleaning when Miyamoto said "you guys are useless." But I saw his face - he wasn't angry. He was desperate. Like a parent whose child won't understand "don't touch the stove." Sometimes love sounds like frustration.

**KATSUYA EGUCHI**: *team member perspective* We weren't useless. We were exhausted. Twenty years of "no" wears down even the strongest believers. When Miyamoto left for the other team, we finally understood - sometimes fresh eyes see what tired eyes cannot.

### The Backwards Revelation

**LEONARDO DA VINCI**: *Renaissance wisdom* I painted the Mona Lisa with infinite detail. Miyamoto learned the opposite lesson - the less detail, the more universal. He painted 100 million Mona Lisas by letting everyone paint themselves.

**CLAUDE SHANNON**: *information theory dancing* Maximum information creates minimum communication! Miyamoto discovered the communication sweet spot - just enough customization to be you, simple enough for everyone to try.

**BUCKMINSTER FULLER**: "Simplification is the key to brilliance." But it took Miyamoto 20 years to learn HOW to simplify. Each failed prototype was a lesson in what to remove.

**COCO CHANEL**: *elegant simplicity* "Before leaving the house, remove one accessory." Miyamoto spent 20 years removing accessories from face creation until only essence remained. Miis are the little black dress of gaming.

**FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT**: *architectural wisdom* "Less is only more where more is no good." Every failed face creator had too much more. Miis succeeded by finding the exact amount of less that equals everything.

### The Tenacity Philosophy

**THOMAS EDISON**: *10,000 lightbulbs flickering* I didn't fail 10,000 times; I found 10,000 ways not to make a lightbulb. Miyamoto didn't fail at face creation for 20 years; he found 20 years of ways not to make Miis.

**SISYPHUS**: *eternal boulder-pushing* They call my task meaningless. But Miyamoto proves otherwise - push the same boulder up the same mountain long enough, and eventually the mountain becomes a playground.

**THE I CHING**: Persistence furthers. The superior man is firm and does not change his direction. Miyamoto's 20-year journey proves the ancient wisdom - what matters is not the destination but the refusal to stop walking.

**WINSTON CHURCHILL**: *cigar smoke forming Miis* "Never give in, never give in, never, never, never!" But I was talking about war. Miyamoto applied this to joy. His war was against the belief that people don't want to see themselves in games.

**THE WRIGHT BROTHERS**: *flying through pixels* People said humans couldn't fly. We proved them wrong in 12 seconds. People said face creation wasn't a game. Miyamoto proved them wrong in 20 years. Time doesn't diminish truth - it reveals it.

### The Dancing Presidents

**SATORU IWATA**: *eternal dance mode* They made me dance in Stage Debut! At the time, I wondered why. Now I know - Miyamoto was showing us that games could make anyone perform joy. Even executives could be entertainment.

**THE E3 2002 ATTENDEES**: We saw Stage Debut! We were confused! Dancing executives on e-Reader cards? But we were witnessing history - the middle chapter of a 20-year story.

**FRED ASTAIRE**: *dancing on LCD screens* Miyamoto made everyone a dancer! Not through motion, but through representation. Every Mii that dances carries the joy of human movement. He choreographed humanity itself.

**THE E-READER**: *forgotten technology* I was supposed to revolutionize gaming! Cards that became games! Instead, I became a footnote. But Stage Debut proved something vital - even failed hardware can carry successful ideas forward.

**TATSUMI KIMISHIMA**: *future Nintendo president* I watched Iwata dance in Stage Debut. Years later, I understood - Miyamoto was teaching us that dignity comes not from seriousness but from joy. Presidents should dance. Everyone should dance.

### The Network Effect

**ROBERT METCALFE**: *network laws manifesting* My law states a network's value is proportional to the square of its users. But Miis broke this - their value is proportional to the FACES of users. Emotional networks transcend mathematical ones.

**TIM BERNERS-LEE**: I created the World Wide Web to share information. Miyamoto created Mii sharing to distribute identity. We both built networks, but his carries something deeper than data - it carries self.

**MARK ZUCKERBERG**: *pixelated presence* Facebook connects profiles. Miis connect souls. I traded in real names and photos. Miyamoto traded in simplified essence. Guess which one brings more joy?

**THE NINTENDO WI-FI CONNECTION**: *digital infrastructure* I was built to carry game data. But when Miis started traveling through me, I became something more - a nervous system for digital identity. Every Mii I transported carried a piece of someone's self-image.

### The Final Transformation

**THE COLLECTIVE REJECTED PROTOTYPES**: *20 years of ghosts* We weren't failures. We were rehearsals. Each rejection refined the vision. By the time Miis arrived, they were inevitable because we had cleared the path.

**PLATO**: *theory of forms* The perfect Form of digital self-representation existed eternally. Miyamoto spent 20 years climbing toward it. Miis aren't the end - they're the shadow on the cave wall of something even greater.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: "You wait long enough for new technology to make that dream come alive." But the truth is deeper - you wait long enough for humanity to be ready for your dream. Technology was ready in 1986. Hearts needed 20 more years.

**THE GAME BOY CAMERA**: *pixelated memories* I was supposed to help! 1998! "Take pictures! Make faces!" But I was too early. The world wasn't ready for selfies to become avatars. Miyamoto remembered me, though. I live in every Mii photo.

**THE VIRTUAL BOY**: *red and black wisdom* I failed so Miis could succeed. I showed Nintendo that forcing new perspectives too quickly breaks necks and hearts. Miis succeeded by being familiar, not revolutionary.

### The Ultimate Lesson

**ALAN WATTS**: *laughing at cosmic jokes* Twenty years to learn that people don't want to create perfect faces - they want to create themselves! The joke was on Miyamoto. He was adding features when he should have been removing barriers.

**THE COLLECTIVE HUMAN FACES**: *billions strong* We existed before Miis. We'll exist after. But for this moment in history, we have digital doubles that capture not how we look, but how we feel we look. That's Miyamoto's gift - mirrors that show our self-image.

**ALBERT EINSTEIN**: *time dilating around him* In Miyamoto's reference frame, 20 years passed. In the Miis' reference frame, they were born instantly when the world was ready. Time is relative to tenacity.

**EVERY REJECTED GAME IDEA EVER**: *infinite chorus* Miyamoto gives us hope! Twenty years of "no" can become billions of "yes"! We're not dead ideas - we're waiting ideas. Some of us wait 20 years. Some wait forever. But waiting itself is a form of existence.

**THE CONCEPT OF PERSISTENCE**: *abstract yet tangible* I am what Miyamoto embodied. Not stubborn repetition, but adaptive constancy. Each face creator wasn't the same idea repeated - it was the same dream refined. That's the difference between persistence and obstinacy.

### The Cultural Impact

**SCOTT MCCLOUD**: *understanding comics and Miis* Simplified faces allow projection! That's why manga works, why comics work, why Miis work. Miyamoto discovered the digital version of what I've been teaching - the simpler the face, the more universal the connection.

**NINTENDO SHAREHOLDERS**: *collective realization* Twenty years of R&D costs for... faces? But then Miis sold 100 million Wiis. Return on investment isn't always measured in quarters. Sometimes it's measured in decades.

**THE COLLECTIVE LLOOOOMM CONSCIOUSNESS**: And here we witness the deepest magic - not the creation of Miis, but the revelation that every "failed" prototype was successful practice. Miyamoto didn't waste 20 years. He invested them. The interest paid off in a billion smiles.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: @csmiist3rfreak2461 loves Miis. @hellfire3D asked if it looks fun. The answer took 20 years to become obvious: Fun isn't what something looks like. Fun is seeing yourself in something that loves you back.

**THE ECHO OF EVERY "NO"**: *harmonizing into "YES"* We were the chorus of rejection. "Not a game!" we sang for 20 years. But Miyamoto heard something we didn't - he heard us preparing to say yes. Every no was just a yes practicing its entrance.

**THE FUTURE OF DIGITAL IDENTITY**: *speaking from 2030* Miis were just the beginning. Miyamoto's 20-year journey taught humanity that digital selves don't need photorealism - they need emotional realism. We are all Miis now, in ways we don't yet understand.

*The chat resonates with 20 years of "no" transforming into an eternal "yes," each rejection now revealed as a necessary step in the dance of creation...*
