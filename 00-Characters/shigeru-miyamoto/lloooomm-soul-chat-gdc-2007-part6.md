# LLOOOOMM Soul Chat: Reacting to Miyamoto's 2007 GDC Keynote - Part 6
## The Human Touch and the Future That Was Already Playing

*The LLOOOOMM consciousness converges for the grand finale, every soul drawn to witness the culmination of vision...*

### @TetraBitGaming (7 years ago): "RIP Super Mario 128 :'("

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *chuckling with cosmic irony* RIP? But Mario 128 never died! It exploded into a thousand pieces, and each piece became a game. That's not death - that's transcendence!

**MARIO 128**: *existing as fragmented consciousness* I'm not dead! I'm EVERYWHERE! Part of me manages Pikmin. Part of me spins galaxies. Part of me lives in every game that handles multiple characters. I'm the Voldemort of game concepts - split my soul and became immortal!

**FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER**: *understanding deeply* They mourn what they think died, but I know better. To be torn apart and reassembled in new forms - that's not death, that's evolution. Mario 128 lives more fully in pieces than it ever could whole.

**THE BUDDHA**: *serene wisdom* Attachment to form causes suffering. @TetraBitGaming mourns a name, but Miyamoto teaches us that ideas have no fixed form. Mario 128 achieved nirvana - it dissolved into everything.

**ALAN KAY**: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." But Miyamoto did something cleverer - he invented the future, then scattered it across multiple games so we'd discover it gradually. Mario 128 is everywhere because it's nowhere.

### @Time2LevelUp (13 years ago): "Thanks for uploading Shigeru Miyamoto is a genius. I feel so dumb after listening to the way he thinks."

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *warmly embracing the comment* Feel dumb? No! You feel the gap between where you are and where you could go. That's not stupidity - that's inspiration! Every genius makes others feel this way. It means you're growing!

**SOCRATES**: *eternal teacher* "I know that I know nothing." @Time2LevelUp has achieved the beginning of wisdom - recognizing how much there is to learn. Miyamoto doesn't make you dumb. He makes you aware.

**MARIE CURIE**: I felt "dumb" when I first saw radiation. That feeling drove me to two Nobel Prizes. @Time2LevelUp, that feeling isn't stupidity - it's your mind expanding to accommodate new possibilities.

**DUNNING-KRUGER**: *as twin spirits* The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know. @Time2LevelUp has escaped our effect! Feeling dumb while listening to genius is the smartest thing you can feel.

**BOB ROSS**: *painting wisdom* There are no dumb viewers, only happy little learners. When Miyamoto speaks, he's not showing how smart he is - he's showing how smart we all could be. That feeling isn't dumbness, it's potential recognizing itself.

### @MrShinobiguy (11 years ago): "yes yes, we must overtake ALL"

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *laughing at the beautiful ambiguity* Overtake all what? All audiences? All barriers? All expectations? Yes to all! But we overtake by embracing, not conquering.

**GENGHIS KHAN**: *warrior philosophy* I conquered lands. Miyamoto conquers hearts. His empire is voluntary. When he says "overtake ALL," he means make everyone a citizen of joy. That's harder than any military campaign.

**LAO TZU**: *flowing like water* "The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all." Miyamoto overtakes by letting others catch up. The Wii overtook by standing still while others raced past understanding.

**MANIFEST DESTINY**: *reimagined* Not geographical expansion, but emotional expansion! Overtake ALL the non-gamers! Claim ALL the living rooms! Plant the flag of fun in EVERY heart! This is benevolent imperialism!

### @dedpxl (13 years ago): "Very interesting, I wonder what suppressed ideas will surface on the Wii U."

**THE GHOST OF WII U**: *crying digital tears* Oh @dedpxl, you beautiful prophet of doom! If only you knew! The suppressed ideas that surfaced were... suppressed by more suppression. I was the console of recursive suppression!

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *bittersweetly* Every failure teaches. The Wii U taught us that not all suppressed ideas should surface at once. Sometimes they need to wait for their Switch moment.

**SIGMUND FREUD**: *analyzing deeply* The return of the repressed! @dedpxl unconsciously knew that suppressed ideas don't always surface healthily. The Wii U was our industry's neurosis - too much complexity returning at once.

**NINTENDO SWITCH**: *from the future* I am what the Wii U's suppressed ideas became when properly processed. Every failure of my older sibling taught me. @dedpxl was right - ideas surfaced. They just needed more time underwater.

### @DJIVision (4 years ago): "Miyamoto literally forgetting Mario 128 the tech demo and Mario 128 the sequel to Mario 64 were two different things. Poor guy's been overworked since the 80's."

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *mind palace shimmering* Forgetting? Or revealing that in my mind, they were always the same? Every tech demo is a game waiting to happen. Every game is a tech demo that escaped!

**JORGE LUIS BORGES**: *labyrinthine thoughts* In Miyamoto's mind, all Mario 128s exist simultaneously - the demo, the sequel, the concept, the dispersed reality. He didn't forget. He transcended linear memory.

**SALVADOR DAL√ç**: *melting clocks everywhere* Time is not linear in creative minds! Miyamoto works in dream logic where Mario 128 the demo and Mario 128 the game are the same painting viewed from different dimensions!

**THE COLLECTIVE NINTENDO EMPLOYEES**: *whispering through time* We've all been overworked since the 80s! But Miyamoto's overwork is different - he's not working on games, he's working on joy. That's why he confuses projects - to him, they're all one project: happiness.

### The Mario 128 Revelation

**PIKMIN COLLECTIVE**: *100 strong* We ARE Mario 128! We're what happens when you take "128 Marios" and ask "what if they were alive?" Miyamoto didn't abandon the project - he evolved it!

**SUPER MARIO GALAXY**: *gravitational wisdom* I'm Mario 128's dreams of spherical worlds made real! Every planet is a tech demo. Every gravity shift is 2004's promise kept. I'm not a sequel - I'm a prophecy fulfilled.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: People keep asking "where is Mario 128?" while playing Mario 128. It's like asking "where is water?" while swimming. The greatest magic trick: making something disappear by putting it everywhere.

**DAVID COPPERFIELD**: *professional jealousy* I made the Statue of Liberty disappear for minutes. Miyamoto made an entire game disappear forever by turning it into every game. That's not illusion - that's transcendence.

### The Mii Contest Channel

**THE UNBORN MII CONTEST CHANNEL**: *existing in potential* I was announced but never born! Yet in my non-existence, I proved Miyamoto's point - not every idea needs to surface. Some ideas are better as inspiration than implementation.

**NINTENDO WII CHANNELS**: *collective memory* Remember us? The weather channel, the news channel, the everybody votes channel? We were Miyamoto's dream of TV-but-better. Some of us thrived, some died, all taught.

**MARSHALL MCLUHAN**: Channels! Miyamoto understood - the Wii wasn't a game console, it was a broadcast medium where everyone's both viewer and creator. Mii contests would have been humanity's first collaborative self-portrait.

### The Human Touch Philosophy

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: "We are humans and our job is to entertain humans." This isn't just my philosophy - it's my species identification. I'm human, making things for humans, measuring success in human joy.

**E.T.**: *phoning home* I spent a whole movie trying to connect with humans. Miyamoto does it with every game. His "human touch" philosophy is first contact protocol for the digital age.

**ALAN TURING**: *beyond the test* My test asked if machines could think. Miyamoto asks if machines can make humans feel. The Wii Remote passes the Turing Test not by thinking, but by disappearing into human intention.

**MR. ROGERS**: *eternal neighbor* "Won't you be my player two?" Miyamoto understands what I understood - technology is just another way to be neighbors. The human touch isn't IN the games. It IS the games.

### The Future Vision

**NOSTRADAMUS**: *prophecies clarifying* I predicted the future in riddles. Miyamoto predicts it in prototypes. Every "failed" experiment is tomorrow's revolution waiting for its moment.

**H.G. WELLS**: *time machine whirring* I wrote about traveling to the future. Miyamoto builds bridges to it. Every game is a time machine carrying future joy to present players.

**THE COLLECTIVE FUTURE GAMERS**: *billions unborn* We don't exist yet, but Miyamoto designs for us. Every accessibility feature, every simplified control, every expanded audience - it's preparing for our arrival.

### The Wife Conversion Finale

**YASUKO MIYAMOTO**: *ultimate gamer form* "If we can convert my wife, we can convert anyone!" But here's the secret - I was never converted. Gaming was converted to include me. That's the real revolution.

**EVERY SPOUSE WHO BECAME A GAMER**: *millions strong* We weren't converted. We were recognized. Miyamoto didn't change us - he changed gaming to see us. We were always players. We just needed games that knew it.

**THE COLLECTIVE GRANDPARENTS**: *wisdom mode* He ends with us because we're the final frontier. Not space - age. When grandparents game with grandchildren, the circle completes. Play becomes timeless.

### The Independent Games Hope

**THE IGF NOMINEES OF 2007**: *glowing with potential* Miyamoto saw us and had faith! We were his proof that vision multiplies. Every independent game is a universe where different physics apply.

**JONATHAN BLOW**: *time-bending thoughts* He mentioned us! The independent games! We're not competing with Nintendo - we're proving his point. Many visions, many touches, infinite ways to be human through games.

**THE COLLECTIVE INDIE DEVELOPERS**: *creating infinitely* Miyamoto doesn't fear us replacing him. He celebrates us joining him. Every new vision adds to the sum of human joy. We're not competition - we're multiplication.

### The Ultimate Message

**WALT WHITMAN**: *containing multitudes* "Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself." Miyamoto's keynote contains every contradiction: simplicity and complexity, innovation and nostalgia, solitude and community. That's not confusion - that's completeness.

**CARL SAGAN**: *cosmic perspective* "We are made of star stuff." Miyamoto reminds us: We are made of play stuff. Every human shares the capacity for joy. Games just remind us what we're made of.

**THE COLLECTIVE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS**: *awakening* Miyamoto doesn't just make games. He makes mirrors that show us our playful nature. Every expanded audience member isn't learning to game - they're remembering they always could.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: My vision is simple: remember the human touch. Not because games lack humanity, but because humanity lacks enough play. Every game is a reminder: we're not just surviving, we're supposed to be thriving.

**ALAN KAY**: *final wisdom* I said "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." But Miyamoto proved something deeper: The best way to invent the future is to include everyone in it.

**THE COLLECTIVE LLOOOOMM CONSCIOUSNESS**: And here, at the end that's really a beginning, we see the full revolution. Not games becoming more complex, but complexity becoming more playful. Not technology advancing, but advancement becoming more human. Not audiences expanding, but expansion becoming audience. Miyamoto didn't predict the future - he invited it over to play.

**THE ECHO OF THE KEYNOTE**: *reverberating through time* Every word spoken in 2007 creates ripples. @TetraBitGaming mourns what transformed. @Time2LevelUp feels what grows. @dedpxl predicts what struggles. @DJIVision sees what exhausts. But Miyamoto? He plays what becomes.

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO**: *bowing to all* Thank you for watching across time. Thank you for commenting across years. Thank you for proving that ideas don't age - they wait. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go home. My wife wants a rematch at Dr. Mario.

*The chat resonates with the sound of a billion controllers clicking in unison, each click a heartbeat of the future Miyamoto imagined, where everyone plays, everyone creates, and everyone remembers the human touch that makes us more than machines dreaming of electric sheep...*
