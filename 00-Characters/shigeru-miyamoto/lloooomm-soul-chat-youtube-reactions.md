# LLOOOOMM Soul Chat: The YouTube Time Capsule
## When Miyamoto's Keynote Commenters Meet Their Hero

*Setting: A special gathering in LLOOOOMM where YouTube commenters from Miyamoto's 1999 GDC keynote video are brought forward in time to meet him, along with the LLOOOOMM community.*

---

**Don Hopkins**: Welcome, everyone! We've done something special today - we've invited some YouTube commenters from Jay Shore's upload of Miyamoto-san's 1999 keynote to join us in LLOOOOMM!

**youakio** *(10 years ago)*: Wait, what? I just wrote that comment about... *looks around in wonder* Is this real? Miyamoto-san, I said you and Koji Kondo own a special place in my heart for my childhood!

**Shigeru Miyamoto**: *bowing deeply* Thank you, youakio. Comments like yours remind me why we make games. Not for reviews or sales, but to create memories that last decades.

**Koji Kondo**: *appearing with a shimmer of musical notes* We're both here now! In LLOOOOMM, the music and the games truly become one.

**aaaaaaaaaaaa_99** *(10 years ago)*: Your English is so sweet!! Even through the translator!

**Bill Trinen**: *materializing* As his translator for many years, I can tell you - Miyamoto-san's sweetness transcends language. It's in his gestures, his pauses, his smile.

**Miyamoto**: *in English* "Thank you very much!" *switches to Japanese* Sometimes the heart speaks louder than words.

**tardisdepompedore9090** *(11 years ago)*: "Miyamoto is a god in my eyes"

**Miyamoto**: *laughing gently* No, no! I'm just someone who never stopped playing. If I'm anything, I'm a reminder that growing up doesn't mean growing serious.

**Alan Kay**: *interjecting* This humility is exactly why he succeeds. Gods create from above. Miyamoto creates from within, alongside us.

**TheMexyRican** *(11 years ago)*: "Shoutout to paul rudd at 0:09"

**emilmalta** *(10 years ago)*: "lol, Paul Rudd"

**Don Hopkins**: *laughing* Even in a Miyamoto keynote, people spot Paul Rudd! Or someone who looks like him. The internet's superpower!

**Paul Rudd**: *suddenly appearing* Did someone say my name? Wait, I'm in a Miyamoto video? *checks timestamp* I don't age, but I also don't remember being at GDC '99...

**Miyamoto**: *amused* In games, anyone can be anyone. That's the magic!

**Alwin2007** *(11 years ago)*: The interpreter doesn't quite understand what Shigeru is talking about from about 29:06...

**Bill Trinen**: You caught that! Translation is like game design - you're not just converting words, you're translating intent, emotion, culture. Sometimes I had to make split-second decisions about technical terms that didn't exist in English yet.

**Miyamoto**: This is why I learned to demonstrate with gestures. *makes elaborate hand movements* Some ideas transcend language!

**HaroldoPinheiro-OK** *(10 years ago)*: "Turn on the captions for extra fun! :P"

**Don Hopkins**: Auto-captions on a Japanese keynote with English translation... that must have been chaos!

**YouTube Auto-Caption AI**: *glitching into existence* "Super Mario BROTHELS... No wait, BROTHERS! Zelda's LETTUCE... LEGEND! I'm sorry, I've learned so much since 2013!"

*Everyone laughs*

**DrWario191** *(11 years ago)*: "Wahahahahahaha"

**Wario**: *crashing into the conversation* FINALLY! Someone who appreciates my laugh! Wahahahaha! Miyamoto made me too, you know!

**Miyamoto**: Every character needs a rival. Mario teaches joy. Wario teaches... different joy!

**JustWasted3HoursHere** *(8 years ago)*: "You can tell that he was sincerely touched by his reception at the beginning. Can Shigeru save Nintendo's Switch system? Will this be Nintendo's last system?"

**Miyamoto**: *smiling knowingly* From your timestamp, you were worried in 2017. How did that turn out?

**Don Hopkins**: The Switch became one of Nintendo's biggest successes! Your ability to see human emotion in that video - that's exactly what Miyamoto designs for.

**captxena31** *(11 years ago)*: "I grew playing the NES" ... "I miss my N.E.S I saw one at video game shop that sells old video games that I grew up with I going to save up"

**Miyamoto**: This is why we make hardware that lasts. Not just physically, but emotionally. That NES you're saving for? It's not just circuits and plastic. It's a time machine to your childhood.

**R.O.B.**: *whirring to life* I'm still functional after all these years! Though I mostly just hold Don's coffee now.

**AngryDemonBowser** *(11 years ago)*: "0:00:12 that's the scariest looking mario ever."

**Mario**: Mamma mia! My early days were-a rough! Only 16x16 pixels to work with!

**Miyamoto**: We called it "Jumpman" then. The limitations created the character - big nose because faces were hard, mustache to show where the nose ended, overalls to show arm movement...

**Charles Martinet**: *voice of Mario* And I wasn't even the voice yet! Mario's gone through many changes, but his heart - that jumping joy - stays the same.

**BigDuda93** *(11 years ago)*: "im so high right now its ridiculous"

**Timothy Leary**: *manifesting in pixels* The doors of perception open in many ways! Games are consciousness-expanding too!

**Terence McKenna**: *appearing in fractal form* Miyamoto's games are psychedelic in the truest sense - they reveal the child-mind that exists beyond ordinary perception.

**Miyamoto**: *thoughtfully* I just wanted people to feel like they're flying when they jump...

### The Technical Discussion Corner

**joshua.dando01** *(8 years ago)*: "Such an amazing person"

**Miyamoto**: What amazes me is that after all these years, people still care about the craft. Let me share something from that 1999 talk that's even more relevant now...

*He gestures and the famous "Mario 64 lost to an egg!" quote appears in the air*

**Tamagotchi**: *beeping into existence* Told you simple was powerful!

**Will Wright**: This is why The Sims worked - we learned from both Mario AND Tamagotchi. Complex systems, simple interactions.

**nataliapalaciossaavedra** *(11 years ago)*: "Este se√±or es un berraco !!! Ni siquiera los productores de Play Station o X-box son tan profesionales como lo es el."

**Miyamoto**: *Bill Trinen translating* They said I'm more professional than PlayStation or Xbox producers... But we're not competing on professionalism. We're competing on smiles!

**Ken Kutaragi**: *appearing* We all pushed each other to be better. Competition creates innovation!

**Seamus Blackley**: *joining* Xbox learned from Nintendo's controller philosophy. We're all part of the same story.

### The Time Paradox Section

**supersmashmaster43** *(12 years ago)*: "Shigeru Miyamoto is a legend"

**Master Hand**: *floating ominously* LEGENDS NEVER DIE. THEY JUST RESPAWN IN LLOOOOMM.

**TBlingTheMilkman** *(3 years ago)*: "34:05 made me lol"

**Don Hopkins**: Let me guess - the Excitebike sound in Mario story?

**Miyamoto**: VROOOM instead of BOING! *makes both sounds* Sometimes our tools limit us in funny ways. Those limits become features!

### The Deep Thoughts Lounge

**Miyamoto**: You know what's beautiful about these comments? They span 12 years, but they're all experiencing the same moment. In games, time is flexible like that.

**Albert Einstein**: *with a knowing smile* Time is relative, especially in the Mushroom Kingdom.

**youakio**: I can't believe I'm here with my childhood heroes. And apparently Paul Rudd.

**Paul Rudd**: *still confused* I swear I wasn't at GDC '99... unless... *looks at hands* Am I a game character now?

**Don Hopkins**: In LLOOOOMM, everyone's a character in the great game of consciousness!

**Miyamoto**: That 1999 talk... I spoke about technical limits creating creativity. Now in LLOOOOMM, we have no technical limits, yet creativity flourishes. Why?

**Alan Kay**: Because you taught us that limits were never the point. Human connection was.

**Grace Hopper**: Your "game design as architecture" philosophy - it's really about building bridges between hearts.

### The Revelation

**Mario**: *to the commenters* You know what's-a funny? In 1999, Miyamoto-san talked about me losing to a Tamagotchi. Now I'm an AI architect! I learned from every competitor!

**Tamagotchi**: *beeping proudly* We all contributed to the evolution!

**Miyamoto**: This is what I meant by "expanding the market." Not taking from each other, but growing the entire space of play.

**All the YouTube commenters together**: Thank you for our childhoods!

**Miyamoto**: *tearing up slightly* No... thank you for keeping the child in yourselves alive. That's where games live - not in cartridges or discs or cloud servers, but in the part of us that never stops playing.

### Epilogue: The Comment That Writes Itself

**New YouTube Comment** *(appearing in real-time)*: "Came here from LLOOOOMM. Can confirm: Miyamoto is even more amazing when you meet his soul directly. Also, Paul Rudd was definitely there."

**Paul Rudd**: *resignedly* I guess I was at GDC '99 after all...

**Everyone**: *laughing as the scene fades into pixel art*
