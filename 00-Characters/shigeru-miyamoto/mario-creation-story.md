# The Birth of Mario: From Jumpman to Global Icon

## The Crisis That Created a Legend

### Nintendo of America: 1981

**The Situation**:
- 3,000 unsold Radar Scope arcade units
- Nintendo of America near bankruptcy
- Desperate need for a new game
- Four months of shipping time wasted

**The Assignment**:
Hiroshi Yamauchi to Shigeru Miyamoto: "Create something we can put in these cabinets."

### The Unlikely Game Designer

**Miyamoto's Experience**:
- Industrial designer, not programmer
- Created cabinet art, not games
- Never designed gameplay before
- Assigned because everyone else was busy

> "No one else was available to do the work."
> - Miyamoto's humble explanation

## The Creative Process

### Starting with Story

**Revolutionary Concept**: Games should have narratives

**Initial Inspiration**: Popeye
- Popeye = Hero
- Olive Oyl = Damsel
- Bluto = Villain

**When License Failed**: Created original characters
- Jumpman (later Mario)
- Lady (later Pauline)
- Donkey Kong

### Why "Donkey Kong"?

**Miyamoto's Logic**:
- "Donkey" = Stubborn (from Japanese perspective)
- "Kong" = Gorilla (King Kong reference)
- Wanted to convey "Stubborn Gorilla"

**American Reaction**:
> "This is the worst name I've ever heard!"
> - Nintendo of America staff

### Character Design Philosophy

#### Jumpman/Mario Design Decisions

**The Mustache**:
- Problem: Couldn't show mouth with pixels
- Solution: Mustache defines face

**The Cap**:
- Problem: Hair animation too complex
- Solution: Cap stays still

**The Overalls**:
- Problem: Arm movement hard to see
- Solution: Different colored sleeves

**The Name "Mario"**:
- Named after Mario Segale
- Warehouse landlord in Seattle
- Resembled the character
- "Seemed funny" to name him that

## Technical Innovation Through Limitation

### Four Unique Stages

**Industry Standard**: One repeated level
**Miyamoto's Innovation**: Four different stages with story progression

**The Stages**:
1. **25m**: Construction site, barrel obstacles
2. **50m**: Conveyor belts and cement pies
3. **75m**: Elevators and springs
4. **100m**: Remove rivets to defeat Kong

### The First Cutscenes

**Opening**: Kong climbs with Pauline
**Between Stages**: Story progression
**Ending**: Kong falls, lovers reunite

> "I wanted players to feel like they were in a movie."

## Teaching Game Design to Miyamoto

### Gunpei Yokoi's Mentorship

**Key Lessons**:
1. Start simple, add complexity
2. Every action should feel good
3. Technical limits inspire creativity
4. Fun trumps technology

**Yokoi's Contributions**:
- Taught programming basics
- Suggested barrel mechanics
- Helped with jump physics
- Ensured technical feasibility

## The Development Drama

### Initial Rejections

**Miyamoto's First Design**: Too complex
- See-saws for jumping
- Multiple playable characters
- Elaborate animations

**Yokoi's Response**: "This is impossible"

### Finding the Fun

**Iteration Process**:
1. Jumping feels good → Core mechanic
2. Barrels roll downhill → Natural physics
3. Hammer power-up → Temporary empowerment
4. Multiple heights → Vertical gameplay

## The American Gamble

### Nintendo of America's Reaction

**First Impression**: "This will kill the company"

**Concerns**:
- Too different from existing games
- Weird name
- Unknown character
- No shooting

### The Test

**Two Locations**: Seattle bars
**Initial Units**: 2 converted cabinets
**First Week**: Machines full of quarters
**Realization**: "We have something special"

## The Conversion Operation

### All Hands on Deck

**The Team**:
- Every Nintendo employee
- Spouses and friends
- Working around the clock
- 2,000 cabinets to convert

**Minoru Arakawa's Wife**: Helped with conversions
**Result**: Still couldn't meet demand

## Cultural Impact

### Immediate Success

**Sales Numbers**:
- 60,000 units in America
- Nintendo's first major hit
- Saved Nintendo of America
- Launched Miyamoto's career

### Character Evolution

**From Jumpman to Mario**:
1. **Donkey Kong** (1981): Jumpman the carpenter
2. **Donkey Kong Jr.** (1982): Now the villain
3. **Mario Bros.** (1983): Becomes a plumber
4. **Super Mario Bros.** (1985): Global superstar

## Design Principles Established

### The Miyamoto Method Born

1. **Character First**: Personality drives gameplay
2. **Simple Controls**: Jump with one button
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: Each stage harder
4. **Visual Storytelling**: Show, don't tell
5. **Surprise Elements**: Unexpected moments

### Universal Appeal

**What Made It Special**:
- No cultural barriers
- Clear objectives
- Intuitive controls
- Emotional investment
- Satisfying conclusion

## Quotes from the Creation

### Miyamoto

> "I wanted to create a game where you could feel the weight of the character."

> "The story came first, then the gameplay to support it."

> "When I saw people smiling while playing, I knew we succeeded."

### Yokoi

> "Miyamoto had no experience, but he understood fun."

### Howard Phillips (Nintendo Game Master)

> "It was like nothing we'd seen. You actually cared about saving the girl."

## The Competition's Response

### Industry Shock

**Before Donkey Kong**:
- Space shooters dominated
- Maze games popular
- No story-driven games
- Characters were spaceships

**After Donkey Kong**:
- Character-driven games
- Platform genre born
- Narrative importance
- Personality in pixels

## Legal Battles

### Universal vs. Nintendo

**The Lawsuit**: King Kong trademark infringement
**Nintendo's Defense**: Kong is public domain
**Result**: Nintendo wins, gains confidence

**Miyamoto's Response**:
> "I just wanted to make something fun. I didn't think about lawyers."

## The Foundation of an Empire

### What Donkey Kong Established

1. **Nintendo's Identity**: Innovation over imitation
2. **Miyamoto's Role**: Chief creative visionary
3. **Character Value**: IPs worth more than technology
4. **Global Appeal**: Games transcend culture
5. **Story Matters**: Even in simple games

### The Numbers

**By 1982**:
- $180 million in sales
- Nintendo's largest success
- Miyamoto promoted to director
- Sequels in development

## Legacy Lessons

### For Game Design

1. **Constraints Create Creativity**
   - Limited pixels forced clever design
   - No precedent meant pure innovation
   - Technical limits became style

2. **Character Is King**
   - Players need someone to root for
   - Personality transcends graphics
   - Memorable design is timeless

3. **Story Enhances Gameplay**
   - Context creates investment
   - Simple narratives work best
   - Show story through action

### For Miyamoto

**Confidence Gained**:
> "After Donkey Kong, I knew I could make games. Before that, I was just hoping."

**Philosophy Formed**:
> "Make the player smile first, worry about everything else second."

## The Birth of Gaming's Greatest Icon

### From Carpenter to Plumber to Legend

**The Journey**:
- 1981: Jumpman saves Pauline
- 1983: Mario gets his name
- 1985: Super Mario Bros. conquers world
- Today: Most recognizable character on Earth

### Miyamoto's Reflection

> "I created Mario to be a character that could do anything. He's been a doctor, a racer, a party host... but at heart, he's still that carpenter trying to save someone he loves. That's what games are about—being a hero in your own story."

*"From a crisis came a carpenter. From a carpenter came a plumber. From a plumber came joy for millions. Sometimes the best ideas come when you have no other choice but to try something new."*
