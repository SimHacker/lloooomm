# The Nintendo Museum: Miyamoto's Most "Un-Nintendo-Like" Creation

## The Paradox of Preservation

> "If ex-president Hiroshi Yamauchi would hear this, I think he would tell us to stop immediately."
> - Shigeru Miyamoto on the Nintendo Museum

### Why It's "Un-Nintendo-Like"

For over a century, Nintendo operated on a simple principle: **Products speak, companies stay silent**. The Nintendo Museum breaks this fundamental rule by:

1. **Celebrating the company** rather than just the products
2. **Looking backward** when Nintendo always looked forward
3. **Revealing secrets** instead of maintaining mystery
4. **Preserving history** rather than reinventing constantly

## Miyamoto's Museum Philosophy

### The Reluctant Historian

> "Nintendo has always shied away from talking about its past. We don't talk about how many units a game has sold. We only talk about the products themselves."

Yet Miyamoto recognized:
- Materials were deteriorating
- History was being lost
- Employees needed cultural context
- The world had changed

### From Resistance to Revelation

**Initial Concept**: Simple storage facility for old products
**Miyamoto's Evolution**: Interactive experience that teaches through play

> "When I put myself in the customer's perspective, I do want to see at least a little bit of stuff from behind the curtains."

## Design Principles for the Museum

### 1. Interactivity First

**Traditional Museum**:
- Look but don't touch
- Read plaques
- Passive observation

**Miyamoto's Museum**:
- Giant controllers you can play
- Create your own Hanafuda cards
- Experience the evolution of play

### 2. The Two-Hour Talk Solution

> "Every year I give a 2-hour talk to 100-200 new employees about what kind of company Nintendo is. After 20 years, I don't really look forward to doing that same talk again."

The museum becomes:
- A permanent orientation experience
- A cultural transmission device
- A living company philosophy

### 3. Repurposing with Purpose

**The Building Itself**:
- Old Nintendo factory
- Not a flashy new structure
- Preservation through transformation
- "Very Nintendo-like to repurpose"

## The Exhibition Philosophy

### What Miyamoto Initially Wanted

1. **Products only** - Show what was made
2. **No behind-the-scenes** - Maintain the mystery
3. **Public face only** - Professional presentation

### What Miyamoto Realized Was Needed

1. **Process revelation** - Show HOW things were made
2. **Human stories** - WHO made them and why
3. **Failed experiments** - What didn't work
4. **Cultural context** - Why it mattered

> "Initially the museum was based on the fact that we were only going to exhibit products, but when I put myself in the customer's perspective, I do want to see at least a little bit of stuff from behind the curtains."

## The Sections That Matter Most

### Miyamoto's Favorite: The Wii Exhibition

**Why It's Special**:
> "The Wii is special to me. At the time, Iwata-san and I felt that games were becoming something specifically for gamers, and we wanted to change that."

**What It Shows**:
- Photos of families playing together
- The democratization of gaming
- Joy across generations
- Success beyond sales numbers

### The Hidden Treasures

**Never-Before-Seen Items**:
- Controller prototypes
- Canceled console designs
- Early character sketches
- Failed experiments

**Miyamoto's Promise**:
> "Currently we have prototypes for controllers and consoles that have never been seen before, nor can they be seen anywhere else."

## The Evolution Plan

### Year One vs. Year Ten

**Current State**:
- Product focused
- Limited behind-the-scenes
- Interactive experiences

**Miyamoto's Vision**:
- More development stories
- Artwork exhibitions
- Movie theater (after "10 movies or so")
- Rotating exhibitions

### The Living Museum Concept

> "Like Nintendo itself, the museum is something that will evolve over time. What it looks like next year might be very different from what it is today."

## The Deeper Purpose

### For Employees

**Traditional Approach**:
- Orientation presentations
- Company handbooks
- Senior staff lectures

**Museum Approach**:
- Experiential learning
- Cultural immersion
- Pride through history

### For the Public

**Not Just Nostalgia**:
- Understanding innovation process
- Seeing failure as progress
- Appreciating iteration
- Recognizing human creativity

## The Yamauchi Paradox

### What Yamauchi Believed

> "If you need to over-advertise something to sell, not selling it at all is better."

- Products should speak for themselves
- Company stories don't matter
- Mystery maintains magic
- Forward, never backward

### How Miyamoto Honors and Defies This

**Honors**:
- Products remain central
- Interactivity over exposition
- Fun before education
- Quality over quantity

**Defies**:
- Celebrates company history
- Reveals development process
- Preserves rather than discards
- Looks backward to move forward

## The Ultimate Un-Nintendo Move

### Why It's Actually Very Nintendo

The museum appears to break Nintendo's rules, but actually embodies them:

1. **Innovation**: Museums haven't been done this way
2. **Surprise**: Unexpected from Nintendo
3. **Play**: Even history becomes a game
4. **Connection**: Brings people together
5. **Evolution**: Will change and grow

> "We're sort of doing something that we are not supposed to do."

But in true Miyamoto fashion, breaking the rules IS the Nintendo way.

## Quotes on the Museum's Future

> "We are currently in the process of planning next steps."

> "After making 10 movies or so, maybe we could even add a movie theater."

> "Every year it will teach new employees what Nintendo is, while sharing that with the world."

## The Legacy Perspective

### What the Museum Represents

- **Acknowledgment** that history matters
- **Confidence** to reveal process
- **Maturity** to look backward
- **Wisdom** to preserve while innovating

### Miyamoto's Final Thought

> "If we were going to tell our employees what kind of company Nintendo is, we thought it might be good to share that with the public as well."

The most "un-Nintendo-like" thing becomes the most Nintendo thing: turning corporate history into an interactive playground where everyone can discover the joy of creation.
