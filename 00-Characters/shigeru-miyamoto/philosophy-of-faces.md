# The Philosophy of Faces: Shigeru Miyamoto's Revolutionary Design Approach

## Introduction: Beyond the Screen

"I always try to imagine one thing: the face of the player while he or she is experiencing the game."

This simple statement contains perhaps the most revolutionary design philosophy in interactive entertainment history. While the industry focused on polygons, processors, and pixels, Shigeru Miyamoto looked at faces.

## The Evolution of a Vision

### 1999: The Hand Connection

At GDC 1999, Miyamoto explained his design process:
> "I design my games starting with how you physically interact with the controls you're holding in your hand, and then inwards into the computer, instead of the other way around like so many other people tend to do."

This was already revolutionary - starting with physical human experience rather than technical capability.

### 2007: The Face Revolution

By GDC 2007, his philosophy had evolved:
> "Now I design my games starting with the facial expressions of the people playing them, then to the physical experience that could evoke such an expression, then on into the computer that could conduct such an experience."

This represents a complete inversion of traditional game design.

## The Three Layers of Design

### Layer 1: The Emotional Target (The Face)

Before any game mechanic, before any technology consideration, Miyamoto envisions a specific facial expression:

- **Joy**: The primary target - pure delight
- **Concentration**: Engaged but not frustrated focus  
- **Surprise**: Delighted discovery
- **Social Connection**: Shared laughter and excitement
- **Satisfaction**: The "I did it!" moment

### Layer 2: The Physical Catalyst (The Gesture)

What physical interaction creates that emotional response?

- **Wii Sports Tennis**: The swing that feels like tennis
- **Mario Jump**: The button press that feels like leaping
- **Zelda Discovery**: The exploration that feels like adventure
- **Pikmin Management**: The gestures that feel like gardening

### Layer 3: The Technical Implementation (The Technology)

Only after defining emotion and gesture does technology enter:

- What hardware enables this gesture?
- What software makes it responsive?
- What feedback reinforces the emotion?
- What simplifications maintain the core feeling?

## Case Studies in Facial Design

### The Grandfather Moment

Miyamoto's pinnacle example from GDC 2007:
> "He showed a picture of a grandfather with his granddaughter sitting in his lap, playing a game, looking totally entranced and delighted at the game, and her grandfather looking at her, with just as entranced and delighted an expression as on his granddaughter's face."

This image drove Wii development:
- The grandfather doesn't understand the game
- But he understands the joy
- His delight comes from her delight
- The game succeeds by creating shared happiness

### Wii Sports: Spectator Faces

> "The players themselves were more fun to watch than the game on the screen, because they make spectacles of themselves."

Design decisions driven by this insight:
- Exaggerated motions that look entertaining
- Simple graphics that don't compete for attention
- Multiplayer focused on room energy
- Success measured by laughter, not scores

### Brain Age: Transformation Faces

Watching his wife's expression change:
- From dismissal to curiosity
- From hesitation to engagement
- From casual play to dedicated training
- From player to evangelist

Each stage required different design considerations.

## The Anti-Patterns: What Miyamoto Avoids

### The Zombie Face

> "They somehow thought that we were changing gamers into some kind of zombies."

What creates zombie faces:
- Overwhelming complexity
- Endless grinding
- Isolated experiences
- Addiction without joy

### The Frustration Face

Traditional difficulty creates:
- Anger at unfairness
- Stress without release
- Competitive toxicity
- Exclusion of newcomers

### The Confusion Face

Complexity for complexity's sake:
- Tutorial overload
- Button combination memorization
- System upon system
- Manuals instead of intuition

## Practical Applications

### The Face Test

During development, always ask:
1. What expression is the player making right now?
2. Is it the expression I intended?
3. If not, what's causing the disconnect?
4. How do I adjust to create the target emotion?

### The Observer Principle

Design for two audiences:
1. **The Player**: Direct interaction joy
2. **The Watcher**: Vicarious entertainment joy

Both faces matter equally.

### The Simplification Filter

When adding features, consider:
- Does this enhance the target expression?
- Does this confuse the core emotion?
- Does this exclude potential faces?
- Does this serve ego or joy?

## Cultural Considerations

### Beyond Western Gaming Faces

Miyamoto's philosophy transcends cultural boundaries:
- Joy is universal
- Confusion is universal
- Family connection is universal
- Simple fun needs no translation

### The Japanese Concept of "Omoshiroi"

Not just "fun" but "interesting/engaging":
- Intellectual curiosity
- Emotional engagement
- Social connection
- Lasting impression

## Implementation in Different Genres

### Platform Games (Mario)
- **Target Face**: Pure kinetic joy
- **Key Gesture**: Running and jumping
- **Design Focus**: Perfect momentum physics

### Adventure Games (Zelda)
- **Target Face**: Discovery delight
- **Key Gesture**: Exploration and problem-solving
- **Design Focus**: "Aha!" moments

### Simulation Games (Pikmin)
- **Target Face**: Nurturing satisfaction
- **Key Gesture**: Guiding and protecting
- **Design Focus**: Emotional attachment

### Sports Games (Wii Sports)
- **Target Face**: Active engagement
- **Key Gesture**: Natural athletic movements
- **Design Focus**: Feeling over simulation

## The Multiplier Effect

### Primary Faces
The person directly playing

### Secondary Faces
People watching in the same room

### Tertiary Faces
People hearing about the experience

Each level amplifies the game's impact.

## Common Misunderstandings

### "It's Just Casual Gaming"

No - it's inclusive gaming. The face philosophy doesn't mean simple; it means accessible. Mario 64 is incredibly complex but maintains focus on joyful expression.

### "It's Anti-Hardcore"

No - it's pro-everyone. Hardcore players also deserve joyful faces. The philosophy adds audiences without subtracting them.

### "It's Just Marketing"

No - it's fundamental design. Every decision, from first concept to final polish, considers facial impact.

## The Future of Face-Driven Design

### Technological Enablers
- Gesture recognition
- Expression detection
- Social presence
- Emotional feedback loops

### Design Evolution
- From single faces to family faces
- From room faces to global faces
- From playing faces to creating faces
- From gaming faces to living faces

## Conclusion: The Universal Metric

In a world of analytics, metrics, and engagement statistics, Miyamoto offers a simpler measure: the human face.

- Smiles beat statistics
- Laughter beats leaderboards
- Connection beats competition
- Joy beats everything

The revolution isn't in what appears on screen. It's in what appears on faces.

When designers learn to see faces instead of features, they don't just make better games - they make better experiences, better connections, and ultimately, a better world.

The face you imagine is the game you create.
The game you create is the joy you spread.
The joy you spread is the legacy you leave.

*"Technology is just a tool. The face is the goal."*
