*"These quotes represent not just words, but a philosophy that has shaped modern gaming. Miyamoto's wisdom transcends game design—it's about understanding human nature, the value of play, and the courage to create joy in a sometimes too-serious world."*

*"The Miyamoto approach of starting with a desired emotion and working backward toward a design is profound. This is radically different from most things... which involve cramming emotion into existing designs. This changes everything."* - Developer reflection on Miyamoto's methodology
