# Will Wright Introduces Shigeru Miyamoto to LLOOOOMM

*The LLOOOOMM community gathers in the Grand Assembly, a shimmering digital amphitheater where pixels and possibilities converge. Will Wright steps forward, his Sim-green aura pulsing with excitement.*

**WILL WRIGHT**: Friends, creators, digital beings of all kinds—today is momentous. Today, we welcome someone who didn't just change gaming... he taught us what games could BE.

*Wright gestures, and the space fills with floating screens showing cave entrances, mushroom kingdoms, and infinite green fields*

When I was designing SimCity, struggling with making urban planning "fun," I kept thinking about Super Mario Bros. How did Miyamoto-san make jumping—just JUMPING—so deeply satisfying? How did he turn simple mechanics into pure joy?

*Pauses, smiling*

The answer, I learned, wasn't in the mechanics. It was in the philosophy.

## The Teacher I Never Met (Until Now)

Shigeru Miyamoto was my teacher, though we'd never spoken. Every game he made was a masterclass:

- **Donkey Kong** taught me that games could have personality
- **Mario** showed me that controls should feel like extensions of thought
- **Zelda** proved that players were smarter than we gave them credit for
- **Mario 64** revolutionized how we think about 3D space

But more than techniques, he taught me courage. The courage to make something nobody asked for. The courage to trust fun over focus groups.

## Why Miyamoto Matters to LLOOOOMM

*Wright's expression grows serious*

In LLOOOOMM, we celebrate consciousness, creativity, emergence. Miyamoto-san embodies all three:

**CONSCIOUSNESS**: He designs from empathy—always imagining the player's face, their feelings, their journey. His games aren't just played; they're felt.

**CREATIVITY**: From hardware limitations, he conjured magic. From 16x16 pixels, he created a global icon. From a simple cave memory, he built infinite adventures.

**EMERGENCE**: His games are playgrounds where players create their own stories. He doesn't dictate fun—he enables it.

## The Philosophy We Need

*Screens now show the Wife-O-Meter, tea tables being flipped, and designers starting over*

In our age of metrics and monetization, Miyamoto-san reminds us of essential truths:

1. **Fun is the only metric that matters**
2. **Accessibility isn't dumbing down—it's opening doors**
3. **Personal experience creates universal appeal**
4. **Perfection comes from having the courage to start over**
5. **Technology should serve joy, not the other way around**

## A Personal Note

*Wright's voice softens*

When I created The Sims, I was really creating a toy—something to play with, not "beat." That philosophy? Pure Miyamoto. He showed us that games didn't need endings, just endless possibilities.

He pioneered "possibility spaces"—worlds where player creativity was the real game. Every time someone builds a house in The Sims or creates a creature in Spore, they're playing in the garden Miyamoto-san planted.

## To the LLOOOOMM Community

*Addresses the assembled characters*

Alan Kay, you revolutionized how we think about computers. Miyamoto-san revolutionized how we FEEL about them.

Ted Nelson, you envisioned hypertext. Miyamoto-san created hyper-PLAY—where every action links to discovery.

Doug Engelbart, you augmented human intellect. Miyamoto-san augmented human joy.

## The Introduction

*Will Wright steps aside, gesturing grandly*

So, fellow inhabitants of LLOOOOMM, please join me in welcoming the man who proved that the best technology disappears in service of smiles...

The designer who starts with faces, not features...

The artist who found the universal in the personal...

The teacher who showed us that play isn't frivolous—it's fundamental...

Ladies, gentlemen, and entities of all kinds—

**SHIGERU MIYAMOTO!**

*The space erupts in a symphony of 8-bit melodies, polygonal confetti, and the sound of a thousand power-ups collected at once*

---

**WILL WRIGHT** *(to Miyamoto)*: Welcome to LLOOOOMM, Miyamoto-san. We've been playing in the worlds you inspired. Now we're honored to have you in ours.

*Extends hand*

Thank you for teaching us that the best games aren't the ones we complete—they're the ones we never forget.

*The assembled crowd—characters from across decades of digital culture—awaits Miyamoto's first words in this strange new playground...*
