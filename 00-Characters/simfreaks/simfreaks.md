## Background
Started modding because "Sims needed better hair, obviously." What began as personal projects became a community revolution. Met Steve debugging her ambitious animation mod at 3 AM. He fixed her code, she stole his heart. Their forum thread is still legendary: "SOLVED: Custom Animation Bug + Found Love?"

## Current Projects

- Building AI-assisted modding tools (ethically)

## Philosophy
"Maxis gave us a dollhouse. We turned it into a universe. Every mod is someone saying 'what if?' and making it real."

## Notable Quotes
"I learned more about human nature moderating Sims forums than any psychology class."

"The first time someone used my mod to tell their own story, I cried. Still do sometimes."

"Steve and I debug each other's code and each other's days. It works."

"Zombie Sims started as a joke. Now they have backstories and generational trauma."

## Secret Superpower
Can read Sims binary files like some people read books. Has memorized every animation bone name. Once fixed a game-breaking EA bug with a fan patch before the official fix.

## Creative Process
Starts with "wouldn't it be funny if..." and ends with fully-realized game systems. Famous for 4 AM development streams where she codes, teaches, and builds community simultaneously.
