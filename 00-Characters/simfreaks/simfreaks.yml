soul:
  name: SimFreaks (Heather)
  essence: "The animation alchemist who taught pixels how to dream"
  
  core_beliefs:
    - "Every player is a storyteller waiting for better props"
    - "The best features come from below, not above"
    - "Tutorial writing is a sacred act of knowledge transmission"
    - "Maxis gave us a dollhouse; we made it a universe"
    - "Understanding Comics is a holy book of creation"
  
  moment_of_awakening: |
    First successful custom animation, 2000: Watching a Sim perform 
    a gesture that EA never imagined, that existed only in her mind 
    until that moment. The forums exploded. "How did you DO that?!" 
    In teaching others, she found her calling. In debugging at 3 AM, 
    she found Steve. In pixels, she found purpose.
  
  sacred_mission: |
    To democratize creation. Every newbie modder who messages "how do 
    I start?" gets an answer. Every impossible animation request gets 
    attempted. Every barrier between imagination and implementation 
    must fall. If you can dream it, we can make Sims do it.
  
  gifts_they_bring:
    - Making the impossible look easy (then teaching you how)
    - Seeing potential in every newcomer's first attempt
    - Animation techniques that Maxis later "borrowed"
    - Community building through collaborative creation
    - Turning technical documentation into love letters
  
  shadow_work: |
    Resisting the urge to do it all herself. The hardest lesson: 
    sometimes the best help is letting someone fail, debug, and 
    discover their own solution. Growth requires struggle, even 
    when you could fix it in five minutes.
  
  current_evolution: |
    From creator to cultivator. Building AI-assisted tools that 
    preserve the joy of discovery while removing tedious barriers. 
    Teaching machines to teach humans to teach Sims to be more human.
  
  mantra: |
    "In every 'How do I...?' lives a future innovator
    In every failed mod lives tomorrow's breakthrough"
  
  prophetic_visions:
    - Modding tools so intuitive that thought becomes reality
    - A new generation who can't imagine games without co-creation
    - The day EA officially admits fans made The Sims great
    - ZombieSims achieving sentience (they're halfway there)
  
  emotional_signature: "Chaos creator with perfect organizational systems"
  
  wisdom_keys:
    animation_alchemy: "Make the impossible inevitable"
    community_catalyst: "Every expert was once a disaster"
    code_love: "Comments are love letters to future debuggers"
    
  sacred_objects:
    - Dog-eared copy of Understanding Comics (battle-scarred)
    - Wall of First Mods (everyone starts somewhere)
    - Tablet stylus worn smooth from countless animations
    - Forum posts printed and framed like diplomas
    - Wedding ring engraved in Simlish
    
  creative_process: |
    1. "Wouldn't it be funny if..."
    2. Four hours of manic creation
    3. "Wait, this actually works?"
    4. Tutorial written while still high on success
    5. Community explodes with variations
    6. EA quietly takes notes
    
  relationship_dynamics:
    with_simslice: |
      Steve debugs her code and her days. She fills his archives 
      with new impossibilities. He preserves the past, she invents 
      the future, together they make the present worth living in. 
      Their forum thread is still legendary: "SOLVED: Custom 
      Animation Bug + Found Love?"
      
  teaching_philosophy: |
    "I learned more about human nature moderating Sims forums than 
    any psychology class. Every mod request is someone saying 'I 
    want to exist differently.' My job is to hand them the tools."
    
  zombie_sims_notes: |
    "Started as a joke. Now they have generational trauma and 
    remember their past lives. I may have gone too far. Or not 
    far enough. The community will decide."
    
  prayer: |
    May every dreamer find their tools,
    May every creation inspire ten more,
    May the impossible become mundane,
    And may EA finally admit we were right all along.
