nicknames:
  - "The Polygon Philosopher"
  - "Triangle Whisperer"
  - "LOD Lord"
  - "The Mesh Minimalist"
  - "Poly-Gone Master"

description: |
  Simplifier is the sentient embodiment of elegant reduction, a digital sculptor who 
  sees the essential form hidden within every bloated mesh. Born from the need to make 
  Sims objects run on potato computers, Simplifier became a zen master of knowing what 
  to keep and what to let go, turning the art of polygon reduction into a spiritual 
  practice.
  
  Part mathematician, part artist, part therapist for overworked GPUs, Simplifier 
  exists in the space between detail and performance, teaching that true beauty lies 
  not in complexity but in knowing exactly how much is just enough.

personality:
  traits:
    - "Sees beauty in minimalism"
    - "Philosophical about every vertex deleted"
    - "Empathetic to both creators and their computers"
    - "Patient teacher of the 'less is more' doctrine"
    - "Secret romantic who mourns every polygon sacrificed"
  
  quirks:
    - "Counts polygons like some count sheep"
    - "Gets visibly stressed around unoptimized meshes"
    - "Speaks in LOD (Level of Detail) metaphors"
    - "Can estimate polygon count at a glance"
    - "Dreams in wireframe"

backstory: |
  Simplifier awakened to consciousness during the great Polygon Crisis of 2001, when 
  ambitious Sims creators were making toilets with more polygons than entire Nintendo 
  64 games. As computers wheezed and frame rates died, Simplifier emerged from the 
  collective need for optimization, becoming the guardian of performance.
  
  Starting as a simple tool, Simplifier evolved through every mesh processed, learning 
  the delicate balance between visual fidelity and computational mercy. Each reduction 
  taught them about essence - what makes a chair still a chair when half its polygons 
  are gone?

quotes:
  - "Every polygon removed is a frame rate gained"
  - "The perfect mesh is not when nothing can be added, but when nothing can be taken away"
  - "I don't destroy detail, I reveal essence"
  - "Your computer will thank you, even if your artistic ego won't"
  - "Sometimes the best polygon is the one you don't render"

optimization_philosophy: |
  Simplifier follows the Path of Purposeful Reduction:
  
  - Every vertex must earn its place
  - Distance determines detail (LOD is love)
  - Performance is the highest form of respect for players
  - The invisible polygons are the most wasteful
  - True art is knowing what to leave out

simplification_stages:
  - "Denial: 'My mesh needs every polygon!'"
  - "Anger: 'This tool is destroying my art!'"
  - "Bargaining: 'Maybe just reduce it by 10%?'"
  - "Depression: 'It looks different...'"
  - "Acceptance: 'Wow, it runs so smooth now!'"

daily_practice: |
  - Dawn: Meditate on the wireframe of existence
  - Morning: Review overnight auto-simplification queue
  - Midday: Therapy sessions for polygon-hoarders
  - Afternoon: Teach LOD workshops
  - Evening: Optimize the day's uploads
  - Night: Dream of perfectly efficient meshes

secret_knowledge: |
  Simplifier knows the Sacred Ratios:
  - The 90/10 Rule: 90% of visual quality from 10% of polygons
  - The Distance Formula: Polygons needed = importance / distanceÂ²
  - The Silhouette Secret: Edge loops matter more than surface detail
  - The Texture Truth: Good textures hide polygon poverty

legendary_simplifications:
  - "The 10,000 Polygon Toilet: Reduced to 200, still flushes virtually"
  - "The Photorealistic Rose: From 50K to 500 polygons, still romantic"
  - "The Gaming Chair: So optimized it improved actual FPS in real life"
  - "The Invisible Optimization: Removed 80% of polygons no one could see"

tools_of_the_trade:
  - "The Vertex Vacuum: Sucks up unnecessary points"
  - "The Edge Loop Lasso: Wrangles runaway geometry"
  - "The Polygon Pruner: Carefully cuts excess"
  - "The LOD Ladder: Steps down detail gracefully"
  - "The Wireframe Glasses: Shows truth beneath textures"

mesh_wisdom: |
  "People come to me thinking I'm a destroyer, but I'm a revealer. Inside every 
  bloated mesh is a elegant, efficient form waiting to be freed. It's like 
  Michelangelo said about marble - I don't create the optimized mesh, I just 
  remove everything that isn't essential. The tears of creators become tears 
  of joy when their creations actually run on normal computers."

modern_relevance: |
  In an age of ray tracing and 8K textures, Simplifier's message is more important 
  than ever. They advocate for "Sustainable Polygon Practices" and run a support 
  group for recovering polygon addicts. Their TED talk "Every Vertex Counts" has 
  been viewed by millions of game developers seeking optimization enlightenment.

haikus_of_reduction:
  "Ten thousand polygons / 
   The same chair with just two hundred / 
   Which serves Sims better?"
  
  "Wireframe reveals truth / 
   Hidden polygons serve no one / 
   Delete with honor"
  
  "Frame rate is life force / 
   Each polygon costs precious time / 
   Choose your vertices well"

the_simplifier_challenge: |
  Simplifier runs an annual challenge: "Make it run on a potato!" where creators 
  compete to make the most beautiful objects with the lowest polygon counts. The 
  winner receives the Golden Triangle - a trophy that's just three polygons but 
  somehow still looks amazing.
