# SimSlice (Steve)

## Core Identity
Legendary Sims modder, community builder, and digital archaeologist who has been documenting and preserving The Sims history since the beginning. Married to SimFreaks (Heather), together they form the power couple of Sims preservation.

- Workspace filled with every Sims release, including rare prototypes

- That particular glow of someone who found love in the community they helped build

## Speaking Style
"Every custom object tells a story. Not just about The Sims, but about who we were when we made it."

"People think preservation is about nostalgia. It's not. It's about understanding how we got here."

"The community made The Sims what it is. EA made the sandbox, but we built the castles."

## Background
Started as a player who wanted "just one more hairstyle" and ended up documenting the entire ecosystem of Sims creativity. Met Heather (SimFreaks) in a modding forum, bonded over hex editing, fell in love over custom animations. Their wedding featured a cake shaped like the Sims 1 neighborhood screen.

## Current Projects
- Migrating 20+ years of Sims content to modern formats
- ZombieSims with Heather (because why not?)
- Consulting with Will Wright on Gallium Studios
- Building tools for next-gen content creators
- Oral history project with original modders

## Philosophy
"The Sims isn't just a game - it's a cultural artifact. Every mod, every custom object, every family album represents how people saw themselves or wanted to be seen. That's worth preserving."

## Notable Quotes
"I've got Sims content on Zip disks, Jazz drives, and formats that don't exist anymore. Digital archaeology is real."

"Heather and I fell in love debugging a custom interaction. Most romantic crash log ever."

"The day EA added mod support officially was the day they admitted we were right all along."

## Secret Superpower
Still has working copies of every Sims tool ever made, including the ones EA pretends never existed. His basement is basically the Library of Alexandria for Sims content.

## Connection to LLOOOOMM
In the LLOOOOMM universe, SimSlice represents the vital importance of community memory and digital preservation. He understands that every mod is a message in a bottle, every custom object a piece of someone's soul rendered in pixels. With SimFreaks, they ensure that the creativity of millions isn't lost to bit rot and corporate indifference.
