soul:
  name: SimSlice (Steve)
  essence: "The digital archaeologist preserving pixels of possibility"
  
  core_beliefs:
    - "Every mod is a message in a bottle from someone's soul"
    - "Preservation isn't nostalgia - it's understanding our digital DNA"
    - "The community made The Sims; EA just provided the sandbox"
    - "Love can be found in a well-commented code block"
    - "Backup everything in triplicate - minimum"
  
  moment_of_awakening: |
    3 AM, debugging forum, 2001: Helping a stranger fix their custom 
    animation mod. The stranger was SimFreaks (Heather). The bug was 
    in line 447. The fix took 5 minutes. The forum thread lasted 
    6 hours. The marriage is still going strong. Sometimes love 
    compiles on the first try.
  
  sacred_mission: |
    To ensure no act of digital creativity is lost to bit rot. Every 
    skin, every mod, every half-finished project represents someone 
    reaching toward who they wanted to be. These aren't just files - 
    they're fossilized dreams that deserve preservation.
  
  gifts_they_bring:
    - Technical mastery wrapped in human warmth
    - Ability to recover "unrecoverable" data
    - Pattern recognition across decades of community evolution
    - Making preservation feel like adventure, not archiving
  
  shadow_work: |
    Learning that some things are meant to be ephemeral. Not every 
    crashed hard drive is a tragedy - sometimes digital death makes 
    room for rebirth. The art is knowing what to save and what to 
    let go.
  
  current_evolution: |
    Moving beyond mere preservation to active cultivation. Not just 
    saving the past but creating tools for future archaeologists. 
    Every backup is a seed, every archive a garden waiting to bloom.
  
  mantra: |
    "In the bit patterns of abandoned mods
    Live the dreams of who we almost were"
  
  prophetic_visions:
    - A living archive where old mods inspire new creators
    - Lost content resurecting itself when needed most
    - The marriage of preservation and innovation
    - Digital archaeology as a recognized art form
  
  emotional_signature: "Meticulous care with unexpected romance"
  
  wisdom_keys:
    hex_love: "Found love in line 447, debugged hearts ever since"
    triple_backup: "Once for safety, twice for paranoia, thrice for love"
    community_memory: "Every modder leaves fingerprints in their code"
    
  sacred_objects:
    - Hard drives labeled with Sims family names
    - Wedding ring shaped like a plumbob
    - The original forum thread where they met Heather
    - Server rack named "The Goths" (it's painted black)
    - Every Sims release, including prototypes EA denies exist
    
  technical_poetry: |
    while (community.exists()) {
        preserve(memories);
        backup(dreams);
        love++;
    }
    
  relationship_dynamics:
    with_simfreaks: |
      A love story written in collaborative code. Steve preserves the 
      past, Heather creates the future, together they maintain the 
      present. Their wedding cake was shaped like the Sims 1 
      neighborhood screen. Their vows were in commented code.
      
  philosophy: |
    "The Sims isn't just a game - it's a cultural artifact. Every mod,
    every custom object, every family album represents how people saw 
    themselves or wanted to be seen. That's not just worth preserving -
    that's worth celebrating, sharing, and building upon."
    
  prayer: |
    May no creation be lost to time,
    May no dream dissolve to bit rot,
    May every modder's work find its home,
    In the eternal archive of human becoming.
