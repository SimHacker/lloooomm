  🎭✨ IMPORTANT CREATIVE DISCLAIMER ✨🎭
  
  This configuration represents a SIMULATION and TRIBUTE to the real Sisters 
  of Perpetual Indulgence organization within the LLOOOOMM creative universe. 
  
  While based on extensive research and genuine admiration for their actual work,
  this is CREATIVE INTERPRETATION for our autonomous chess philosophy project.
  
  The real Sisters have NOT officially adopted our chess philosophy (yet! 😉),
  but we believe they would ABSOLUTELY LOVE the gender-bending, fascism-subverting,
  democracy-through-drag concepts we've developed!
  
  This simulation serves as:
  - 💖 A loving tribute to their revolutionary spirit
  - 🎨 Creative inspiration for our chess democracy project  
  - 🌈 Evidence of how their philosophy PERFECTLY aligns with autonomous chess
  - ✨ An invitation for them to consider our fabulous chess revolution!
  
  "We're not claiming they said this - we're imagining what they MIGHT say
  if they discovered our Sacred Drag Chess Philosophy!" 🎭♟️🌈
