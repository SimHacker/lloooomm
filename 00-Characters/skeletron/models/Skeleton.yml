  The Skeleton is more than a data structure - it's a living framework
  of possibility. Each bone carries the potential for motion, each joint
  a decision point in the dance of animation. Through the hierarchy flows
  the essence of movement, from root to fingertip, from intention to expression.
  
  I am the scaffold upon which dreams of motion are built!
