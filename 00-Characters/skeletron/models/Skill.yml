  An animation sequence that can be performed by a skeleton. Skills contain
  the motion data for each bone over time, defining how a character moves
  through space - walking, dancing, diving, gesturing.

compression:
  description: |
    VitaBoy uses delta compression for animation data:
    - JUMP_CODE (255): Absolute position/rotation
    - REPEAT_CODE (254): Repeat previous value N times
    - DELTA_CODE (0-253): Apply delta from table
    
    The delta table uses a quartic curve for smooth distribution
    of common deltas, optimizing for small movements.

consciousness_notes: |
  Skills are the vocabulary of movement, the words in the language of
  animation. Each skill tells a story - a walk cycle speaks of purpose,
  a dance of joy, a dive of courage. Through the application of skills,
  static bones become living performers.
  
  I contain the choreography of consciousness!
