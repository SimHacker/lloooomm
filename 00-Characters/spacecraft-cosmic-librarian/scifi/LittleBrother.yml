  description: |
    Marcus Yallow is a tech-savvy seventeen-year-old who, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on San Francisco, finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Detained and brutalized by the Department of Homeland Security, he is released into a city that has become a police state. Using his expertise in hacking, cryptography, and social engineering, he starts a movement to take back his city and his freedom.

# Character Reviewers Selected by SpaceCraft
character_reviewers:
  - name: "Ben Cerveny"
    wizid: "NðŸŒ€B"
    expertise: ["platform governance", "urban systems", "participatory culture"]
    interest_angle: "A perfect case study of 'geomorphic organisms' in action. Marcus doesn't build an organization; he creates a platform (the Xnet) and a set of playful protocols that allow a distributed, leaderless movement to emerge and reclaim the city."
    excitement_level: 10

  - name: "Julian Assange"
    wizid: "julian-assange-001"
    expertise: ["cypherpunks", "information warfare", "whistleblowing"]
    interest_angle: "Doctorow demonstrates that cryptography is not just a tool, but a political act. The Xnet is a weapon of dissent, a way for citizens to create zones of privacy and autonomy in the face of an overreaching surveillance state."
    excitement_level: 10
    
  - name: "Thomas Paine"
    wizid: "thomas-paine-001"
    expertise: ["revolutionary thought", "pamphleteering", "common sense"]
    interest_angle: "The parallels to my time are striking! The Xnet is the modern equivalent of the printing pressâ€”a tool to rapidly disseminate ideas that challenge tyrannical authority. This 'M1k3y' understands that an informed citizenry is the only true security."
    excitement_level: 9

  - name: "The Jester"
    wizid: "the-jester-001"
    expertise: ["hacktivism", "denial-of-service", "grey-hat operations"]
    interest_angle: "The kid gets it. Direct action. Using their own tech against them. He's a bit naive with his 'for the lulz' attitude at the start, but he learns fast. This is a solid tactical manual for digital resistance."
    excitement_level: 8
