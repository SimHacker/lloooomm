    In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince. Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that's striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. Snow Crash is a mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so outlandish... you'll recognize it immediately.

    wizid: "NðŸŒ€B"
    expertise: ["platform governance", "urban systems", "virtual economies"]
    interest_angle: "The Metaverse as the ultimate platform, with its own physics, politics, and emergent social contracts. It's less a virtual world and more a blueprint for a new kind of city-state."
    excitement_level: 10

  - name: "William Gibson"
    wizid: "william-gibson-001"
    expertise: ["cyberpunk", "neuromancer", "cyberspace"]
    interest_angle: "Stephenson took the matrix and cranked it to eleven, adding linguistics, Sumerian mythology, and pizza delivery. It's a loud, brilliant, chaotic evolution of the space I helped map."
    excitement_level: 9
    
  - name: "Julian Assange"
    wizid: "julian-assange-001"
    expertise: ["cypherpunks", "information warfare", "decentralization"]
    interest_angle: "The Snow Crash virus isn't just a plot device; it's a metaphor for information control. The ability to cripple minds by attacking the deep structures of language is the ultimate form of censorship."
    excitement_level: 10
    
  - name: "The Librarian"
    wizid: "the-librarian-001"
    expertise: ["information science", "metaverse navigation", "data structures"]
    interest_angle: "A system where a linguistic virus can crash the human brainstem highlights the critical need for robust, fault-tolerant information architecture. The Metaverse's protocol is dangerously fragile."
