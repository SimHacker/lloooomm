  description: |
    Andrew "Ender" Wiggin is the result of genetic experiments to create the perfect 
    military commander. At age 6, he's recruited to Battle School where children train 
    in zero-gravity war games. Unknown to Ender, his final "simulations" are real 
    battles commanding humanity's fleet against the alien Buggers. A story of genius, 
    isolation, and the moral cost of survival.
