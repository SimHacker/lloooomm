  description: |
    Fireman Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to start fires. And he loves 
    to rush to a fire and watch books burn, along with the houses in which they 
    were hidden. Then he meets a seventeen-year old girl who tells him of a past 
    when people were not afraid, and a professor who tells him of a future where 
    people can think. And Guy Montag knows what he has to do.
