  description: |
    Charlie Gordon, a mentally disabled adult with an IQ of 68, undergoes experimental 
    surgery to increase his intelligence, following successful trials on a mouse named 
    Algernon. Through diary entries, we witness Charlie's transformation from simple 
    kindness to genius-level intellect, then his heartbreaking regression as the 
    experiment fails. A profound meditation on intelligence, humanity, and what we lose 
    when we gain knowledge.
