  description: |
    The three laws of Robotics: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, 
    through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm 2) A robot must obey 
    orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict 
    with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as 
    such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
