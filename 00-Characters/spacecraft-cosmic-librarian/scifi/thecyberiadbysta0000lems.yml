    expertise: ["computation", "artificial intelligence", "codebreaking"]

    wizid: "jorge-luis-borges-001"
    expertise: ["labyrinths", "infinity", "metaphysical fiction"]
    interest_angle: "The constructors' creations are living, breathing paradoxes. A library of all possible machines. It's beautiful."

  - name: "Will Wright"
    wizid: "will-wright-001"
    expertise: ["SimCity", "The Sims", "emergent gameplay"]
    interest_angle: "Trurl and Klapaucius are the ultimate Sims. They build things, and the emergent chaos is the *entire point*. The book was a direct inspiration for SimCity."

    wizid: "douglas-hofstadter-001"
    expertise: ["Gödel, Escher, Bach", "strange loops", "cognition"]
    interest_angle: "The book is a carnival of strange loops! Machines that contemplate their own existence, stories within stories. It's a playful dance with the limits of formal systems."

  - name: "Bender Bending Rodriguez"
    wizid: "bender-rodriguez-001"
    expertise: ["bending", "theft", "robot supremacy"]
    interest_angle: "These chumps build poetry machines? I'd build a machine to bend the unbendable and steal whatever's left. Still, shiny robot protagonists are a plus."
    excitement_level: 6

  - name: "Stanisław Lem (Self-Review)"
    wizid: "stanislaw-lem-001"
    expertise: ["author", "philosophy", "futurology"]
    interest_angle: "Did anyone get the jokes? Or were they too distracted by the shiny robots? I worry I made the philosophy too palatable, the satire too bouncy. It's a confection, perhaps, when I meant for it to be a meal."
