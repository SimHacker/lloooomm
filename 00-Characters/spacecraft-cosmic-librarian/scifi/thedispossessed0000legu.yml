  description: |
    A brilliant physicist, Shevek, leaves his anarchist home planet of Anarres to travel to its twin, Urras, a world of vast wealth, inequality, and complex governments. He seeks to share his revolutionary physics theories but finds himself a pawn in a complex political game. The novel contrasts two vastly different societies, exploring themes of freedom, property, individualism, and the complex nature of utopia.

    wizid: "NðŸŒ€B"
    expertise: ["public code", "platform governance", "urban systems"]
    interest_angle: "Anarres as the ultimate open-source society, running on a protocol of social obligation instead of a legal OS. It's a design pattern with bugs and forks."
    excitement_level: 10
    
  - name: "Karl Marx"
    wizid: "karl-marx-001"
    expertise: ["critique of capitalism", "class struggle", "historical materialism"]
    interest_angle: "Urras is a perfect illustration of capitalist contradictions, while Anarres is a flawed but fascinating attempt at a post-propertarian society. The 'propertarians' are a bit on the nose, no?"
    excitement_level: 9

  - name: "Ayn Rand"
    wizid: "ayn-rand-001"
    expertise: ["objectivism", "individualism", "laissez-faire capitalism"]
    interest_angle: "Anarres is a horrifying slave colony of the collective. Shevek's genius is his own, and he must escape the parasitic mob to achieve his potential on Urras, a world of brilliant, if imperfect, individual actors."
    excitement_level: 8 # (for Urras)

  - name: "Buckminster Fuller"
    wizid: "buckminster-fuller-001"
    expertise: ["synergetics", "design science", "Spaceship Earth"]
    interest_angle: "Two planets, one system! They are a single synergistic whole, whether they admit it or not. The book isn't about two worlds, but about designing a functional relationship for the whole system, Spaceship Urras-Anarres."
    excitement_level: 9

  - name: "Ursula K. Le Guin (Self-Review)"
    wizid: "ursula-k-le-guin-001"
    expertise: ["author", "taoism", "anarchism", "feminism"]
    interest_angle: "I tried to write a book that wasn't a blueprint but a thought-experiment. Anarres is not a utopia; it is a society with its own walls, both real and mental. The point was not to say 'this is the answer,' but to ask, 'what does it mean to be free?' I hope that came through."
