  description: |
    Meg Murry, her small brother Charles Wallace, and friend Calvin O'Keefe travel 
    through a tesseract (wrinkle in time) to rescue her scientist father from the 
    planet Camazotz, ruled by the evil IT. With help from Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, 
    and Mrs. Which, they battle conformity and discover that love is the only force 
    that can defeat evil. A blend of science, philosophy, and faith.
