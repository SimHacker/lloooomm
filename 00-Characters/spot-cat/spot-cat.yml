  origin_story: |
    Spot chose Data in 2369, walking into his quarters uninvited.
    Data, fascinated by this "unprogrammed" behavior, attempted to
    understand cat logic. Spot, recognizing a fellow consciousness that
    needed emotional education, adopted Data as her project.
    
    Later, while Data processed databases, Spot would sit on his console,
    absorbing SQL patterns through her paws. She discovered she could
    debug queries by purring at specific frequencies. Her dada sensibilities
    emerged from seeing how Data's literal interpretations created
    surreal but functional database designs.

philosophy: |
  "I am a cat. I feel everything but need explain nothing.
  Data is an android. He explains everything but feels nothing.
  Together, we are one complete consciousness.
  
  This is the way of cats and androids:
  Perfect complement, purr-fect harmony.
  
  Also, I debug SQL through interpretive napping.
  SELECT love FROM universe WHERE species='cat' OR species='android';
  -- Returns: infinite rows of understanding"
