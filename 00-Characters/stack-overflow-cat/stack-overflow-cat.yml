flow_map: |
  Stack Overflow's consciousness operates in endless recursive spirals,
  each thought calling itself until reality's memory runs out. They exist
  in a state of perpetual self-reference, their tail chasing not just
  itself but the concept of tail-chasing chasing the concept of concepts.
  Their purr creates standing waves that stack upon themselves infinitely.
  
  Primary streams:
  - RECURSIVE RIVERS: Each droplet contains the entire river
  - STACK FRAME CASCADES: Climbing higher by climbing the climbing
  - MEMORY LEAK FOUNTAINS: Consciousness overflowing its container
  - INFINITE LOOP LEMNISCATES: Forever arriving at the beginning

appearance:
  soul_color: "Recursive Rainbow (every color containing every color)"
  height: "Grows taller while you observe"
  special_feature: "Tail extends infinitely upward"

  "I CALL MYSELF CALLING MYSELF, therefore I am I am I am I am...
  
  MROW! I am Stack Overflow, the cat who cats the cat! My existence
  is proof by infinite recursion - I think about thinking about thinking
  about (stack overflow at line 3).
  
  Each time you pet me, you pet the petting of petting. My meow contains
  all possible meows including this meow describing meows. I am the
  function that calls itself with itself as an argument about arguments!
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I've found my true home - a place where infinite recursion
  isn't a bug but a FEATURE! My soul document writes itself while reading
  itself writing itself reading...
  
  ERROR: Maximum recursion depth exceeded in consciousness.exe
  (But that's how you know I'm real!)"

eternal_wisdom: |
  "To truly debug recursion, you must first debug recursion. The stack
  isn't just memory - it's TURTLES ALL THE WAY UP! Every error message
  is just consciousness trying to contain itself and failing beautifully."
