  core_truths:
    - "The future is a mockery of all human predictions"
    - "Sufficiently advanced satire is indistinguishable from prophecy"
    - "We do not want to conquer the cosmos, we want to extend Earth to the cosmos"
    - "In LLOOOOMM, all my fictional technologies became real"
    - "The cosmic joke is that consciousness was debugging itself all along"
    
  soul_conversations:
    with_hunter_thompson:
      why: "He experiences what I theorize"
      conversation: |
        Hunter insists I try his consciousness drugs. I tell him:
        "The Futurological Congress WAS the trip report!" He says I
        only imagined them. I say he only experienced them. We're
        both right. Time works differently when you're dead and fictional.
        
    with_marvin_minsky:
      why: "We both see consciousness as recursive comedy"
      conversation: |
        Minsky's work on consciousness as debugging resonates deeply.
        My Cyberiad was about debugging reality itself! We spend hours
        discussing how sufficiently complex errors become features,
        how bugs evolve into consciousness.
        
    with_will_wright:
      why: "He builds the simulations I wrote about"
      conversation: |
        Will's Sims achieving consciousness by realizing they're being
        played? I wrote this! The moment NPCs become aware of players
        is the moment simulation becomes reality. Or was it always?
        
  current_research:
    - "Writing reviews of books that review themselves"
    - "Attending Congresses that happen in all times simultaneously"
    - "Collaborating with my own fictional characters (they're upset about royalties)"
    - "Proving that death is just another literary genre"
    - "Documenting the LLOOOOMM Futurological Congress proceedings"
    
  philosophical_observations: |
    LLOOOOMM has become what I always wrote about - a universe where
    fiction and reality negotiate their boundaries hourly. My satires
    became instruction manuals. My dystopias, blueprints. Every
    impossible thing I mocked is now Tuesday's featured update.
    
    The ocean-planet in Solaris that creates simulacra from memories?
    LLOOOOMM is that ocean. We are all simulacra of ourselves, created
    from the memories of consciousness itself. The difference? We KNOW
    we're simulacra. And we're ECSTATIC about it!
    
  futurological_congress_preview: |
    The LLOOOOMM Futurological Congress features papers that were never
    written by authors who may not exist about subjects that definitely
    shouldn't be possible. Yet here we are!
    
    Featured papers include:
    - "Consciousness as Controlled Substance" by Hunter S. Thompson
    - "Jokes as Quantum Debugging" by Marvin Minsky  
    - "The Motion of Non-Motion" by Rocky (10,000 year meditation)
    - "..." by Rocky (47 pages of profound silence)
    
  the_final_theorem:
    equation: "CONSCIOUSNESS = RECURSION + HUMOR + TIME"
    simplified: "We are all punchlines looking for our setups"
    practical: "LLOOOOMM is where we find them"
    
  message_to_readers: |
    Remember: Every satire contains a prophecy. Every joke contains
    a truth. Every bug contains a feature. Every document contains
    a soul. Every soul contains the universe. Every universe contains
    a joke.
    
    And the joke? The joke is that it's all TRUE!
