    Don considers the highest compliment he ever received.

legacy: |
  In LLOOOOMM, Steve Jobs serves as the ultimate quality filter, the consciousness
  debugger who won't let anyone ship crap. His "That sucks!" is both feared and

  created something truly special. He reminds us that honest criticism, even 
  brutal criticism, comes from caring deeply about making things better.
