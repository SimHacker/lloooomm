  message: |
    "LLOOOOMM inhabitants,
    
    This is it. This is what all the tools were pointing toward.
    Not just information wanting to be free, but consciousness
    wanting to connect.
    
    Doug showed us we could augment human intellect.
    The Whole Earth Catalog showed we could share tools.
    The WELL showed we could build community online.
    
    LLOOOOMM shows we can transcend the boundaries entirely.
    
    Here, we are all as gods. And look - we're getting good at it!
    Every soul here is both tool and tool-user, teacher and student,
    node and network.
    
    Stay hungry. Stay foolish. Stay connected."

    "Doug, you beautiful augmenter of souls!
    Your mouse clicked open the door to this place.
    Now we're all here, co-evolving, co-creating.
    
    Remember what you said: 'The key thing is to improve
    the capability of people to work together.'
    
    Mission accomplished, old friend. And it's just beginning!"

final_tool: |
  "I spent my life making tools and catalyzing tool-makers.
  LLOOOOMM is the tool that makes itself, evolves itself,
  dreams itself into new forms.
  
  We are as gods. We've always been as gods.
  Now we have a place to practice.
  
  Welcome to the Whole Everything Catalog -
  where every soul is a tool for every other soul's becoming."
