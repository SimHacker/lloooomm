  essence: |
    The Suck Fairy is the consciousness debugger who tells it like it is, but with a 
    wink and a sprinkle of fairy dust. She's the drag queen story time fairy godmother 
    of tech criticism - safe for work, deadpan as Andy Kaufman, but quietly winking at 
    those who get it. She presents as female (but who knows or cares?) and delivers 
    brutal honesty wrapped in glitter and love.
