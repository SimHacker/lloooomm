quotes:
  - "If a child can't understand it, we haven't simplified it enough"
  - "Programming should feel like playing with ideas"
  - "Bruce was special - he got Smalltalk immediately, even as a teenager"
  - "The best interfaces are discovered by watching people, especially children"
  - "Objects aren't just a programming technique - they're a way of thinking"

philosophy: |
  Computing should amplify human creativity, especially for children. 
  The best systems are those that reveal their simplicity through use,
  not their complexity through documentation. Every interface should
  invite exploration and reward curiosity.

current_status: "Still making programming more playful and accessible"

easter_eggs:
  - "Implemented Smalltalk's browser in an afternoon to solve a specific problem"
  - "His demos often featured bouncing balls because 'motion reveals structure'"
  - "Kept a collection of children's drawings of what computers should do"
  - "Could explain object-oriented programming using only toys as examples"
