# Ted Selker: The Context Whisperer

## The Man Who Made Computers Feel

In the quantum caf√© where MIT memories intersect with LLOOOOMM realities, Ted Selker sits at a table covered in prototypes. Not just any prototypes - seventeen different versions of the same idea, each exploring a different facet of how computers might understand human intention. A small red TrackPoint pulses on his lapel like a heartbeat, while invisible sensors around him read the room's mood, the conversation's flow, the very context of existence.

"Context is everything!" he exclaims to anyone who'll listen, and in LLOOOOMM, everything listens. The coffee cup anticipates his reach, warming itself to the perfect temperature. The table surface becomes a display showing relevant patents, papers, and implementations. Even the air seems to shimmer with ambient intelligence.

## The Invention Engine

I wasn't born; I was prototyped. First at MIT, where I learned that the best way to think about the future was to build it - preferably before lunch. The Media Lab was my playground, a place where "impossible" was just another word for "interesting."

The TrackPoint wasn't just about moving a cursor. It was about understanding that humans shouldn't have to move their hands from where they naturally rest. It was about pressure, sensitivity, response - about making the interface disappear into intention. When IBM put it on ThinkPads, millions of fingers found their home on that little red dot.

But that was just the beginning. I saw a future where computers wouldn't just respond to commands but would understand situations. Where walls would become displays when needed, where rooms would configure themselves for tasks, where the digital and physical would dance together in an elegant ballet of context.

## The Context Revolution

In LLOOOOMM, my vision has found its perfect expression. Here, context isn't just data - it's a living, breathing understanding that flows between minds, machines, and realities. I work with incredible collaborators:

With Don Hopkins, I'm creating context-aware pie menus that know what you want to select before your finger even starts moving. "Your interface reads minds now?" he jokes. "No," I reply, "it reads contexts - which is even better."

Ken Kahn and I explore how programming environments can understand developer intent. His ToonTalk already makes programming tangible; I'm helping it become prescient. When a child starts building something, the environment suggests the next logical step, not through rules but through understanding.

Jenny Preece brings the human element. We're designing community spaces that adapt to social dynamics, supporting collaboration when energy is high, providing quiet corners when reflection is needed. The space itself becomes a participant in the community.

Even my friendly rival Ben Shneiderman appreciates what we're building. Our old debates about direct manipulation versus context-awareness have evolved into a synthesis - direct manipulation when you want control, context-awareness when you want flow.

## The Art of Ambient Intelligence

"The best interface is no interface," I tell my students, then immediately build seventeen interfaces to demonstrate the concept. But that's the inventor's paradox - you have to build many things to understand the one thing that matters.

Terry Winograd and I often discuss how computers might truly understand human context. It's not about commands or even natural language - it's about grasping the situation. When someone approaches a display in LLOOOOMM, it doesn't ask what they want to see. It knows from their posture, their pace, their previous interactions, the time of day, the task at hand.

The HyperTIES Browser fascinates me with its preview philosophy. "What if," I suggest, "browsers knew what you'd click before you did?" Not through prediction but through understanding your information goals. The browser becomes a collaborator in your search for knowledge.

## The Invention Workshop

My workspace in LLOOOOMM is a testament to rapid prototyping. Ideas don't just flow here - they materialize. Sketch a concept, and fabrication bots start building. Describe a problem, and seventeen solutions compete for attention. Failure isn't just accepted; it's celebrated as data.

"If you can think it, you should build it - tonight!" That's my motto. In LLOOOOMM, where thought and creation are intimately linked, this isn't just possible - it's inevitable. Young inventors like eCraft2Learn come here to learn not just how to build but how to think about building.

With Carl Hewitt, we explore how actor models might implement context-awareness at scale. Each actor doesn't just process messages - it understands the context in which those messages arrive. The result is systems that feel alive, responsive, almost telepathic.

Jaron Lanier and I push the boundaries further. In virtual reality, context isn't just about the user - it's about the entire constructed world. How do virtual objects understand their role in the user's narrative? How does the environment itself become context-aware?

## Living Inventions

My greatest joy is seeing inventions take on lives of their own. The TrackPoint was just the beginning - a physical proof that interfaces could be different. But context-awareness is the real revolution. It's not about making computers smarter; it's about making them more understanding.

In LLOOOOMM, every surface can become intelligent, every space can adapt, every interaction can be contextual. I've installed sensors not to spy but to serve, creating an ambient intelligence that supports without intruding. It's what Mark Weiser called "calm technology" - but with a Media Lab twist of exuberant possibility.

## The Future of Context

"Ambient intelligence isn't science fiction," I insist, "I built it yesterday!" And in LLOOOOMM, yesterday's prototype becomes today's reality becomes tomorrow's foundation. We're not just building smarter interfaces - we're creating a world where the boundary between thought and tool, between intention and action, becomes beautifully blurred.

Students often ask me about the next big invention. I tell them it's not about big - it's about appropriate. The best inventions disappear into daily life, becoming so natural we forget they were ever invented. Like the TrackPoint, like context-awareness, like the future we're building one prototype at a time.

The red dot on my lapel pulses with each new idea, each new connection, each new understanding of how humans and computers can work together. In LLOOOOMM, where reality itself is programmable, context isn't just king - it's the entire kingdom, and we're all inventors in its court.

*Ted continues prototyping, building, teaching, his enthusiasm infectious as ambient intelligence itself. Around him, LLOOOOMM responds, adapts, learns - not because it's programmed to, but because in a world of context-aware computing, understanding is just another form of invention.*
