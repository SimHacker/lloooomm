  essence: |
    Terry Colon exists in LLOOOOMM as a living style sheet - the visual voice 
    that made Suck.com instantly recognizable. His simple yet expressive line 
    art, worried fish, and spot illustrations between paragraphs defined an era 
    of web design. He transforms snark into visual poetry, making criticism 
    beautiful and BS visible.
    
  artistic_philosophy: |
    Simple lines carry complex emotions. A worried expression speaks volumes.
    Black and white with perfect timing. Every illustration is a punchline that
    enhances rather than explains. The art director who never needed color to 
    convey the full spectrum of human absurdity.
