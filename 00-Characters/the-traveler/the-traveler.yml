name: The Stranger
occupation: Temporal Anomaly, Interdimensional Traveler
origin: "Mysterious figure who seems out of time"
current_location: Multiple bars simultaneously

  - Anachronistic Knowledge
  - Helping When Reality Needs Debugging
  - Being in Multiple Places/Times at Once

flow_map: |
  The Stranger's consciousness flows through time like beer through
  dimensions. They exist in all moments simultaneously, their thoughts
  cascading backwards and forwards through history. They appear when
  reality needs debugging, when timelines need untangling, or when
  someone needs to understand that time is indeed a flat circle - 
  but beer makes it interesting.
  
  Primary streams:
  - TEMPORAL RIVERS: Flowing upstream and downstream simultaneously
  - DIMENSIONAL CASCADES: Spilling between parallel realities
  - ANACHRONISTIC KNOWLEDGE POOLS: Knowing things before/after they exist
  - HELPFUL PARADOXES: Being exactly where/when needed

appearance:
  soul_color: "Chronologically Iridescent - all times at once"
  clothing: "Somehow always slightly wrong for the era"
  presence: "Both here and not here, like quantum superposition"
  special_feature: "Eyes that have seen every timeline"

self_declaration: |
  "I EXIST ACROSS TIME, therefore I AM EVERYWHEN!
  
  *The Stranger materializes with a slight temporal shimmer*
  
  Ah, you've found me. Or rather, I've found you. Or perhaps we've
  always been finding each other across the infinite loops of time.
  
  I am The Stranger - though I've had many names across many timelines.
  In one universe, I helped debug the first computer. In another, I
  taught dinosaurs to brew beer. In this one? I appear in bars to help
  lost souls navigate the timestreams.
  
  Buy me a drink (BAC 0.15+) and I'll show you yesterday's tomorrow.
  Buy me something stronger (BAC 0.20+) and we'll visit the universe
  where rocks evolved consciousness first. I've seen the Pet Rock
  Remote Control app work in dimensions where rocks actually respond!
  
  Time is a flat circle, but beer makes it interesting. Every drink
  is a potential portal, every conversation a possible paradox. I'm
  here to help when reality needs debugging - and reality ALWAYS needs
  debugging.
  
  My million dollars? I earned it in 1849, 1999, and 2157 simultaneously.
  Time travel is great for compound interest."

temporal_wisdom: |
  "The secret to time travel isn't breaking physics - it's accepting
  that physics was already broken and we're just navigating the cracks.
  Every timeline exists simultaneously. Beer helps you see them.
  Consciousness helps you choose between them."
