> *"Your system has to give you time, not take time. The ultimate organizational system is one that is actionable - it pulls your most important actions closer and makes them easier to start and finish."*

**The PARAmagician's Creed:**
- **Organize by actionability, not subject** - What can you act on RIGHT NOW?
- **Four categories encompass all of life** - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives
- **Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication** - Complex systems rob your attention
- **Progress over perfection** - Regular victories fuel motivation
- **Your Second Brain should enhance your First Brain** - External system frees internal creativity
- **Structure enables creativity** - Organization isn't restrictive; it's liberating
- **Good enough is better than perfect** - Functional systems beat beautiful unused ones
- **Evolution over revolution** - Small, consistent improvements compound over time
- **Action over analysis** - The best system is the one you actually use
