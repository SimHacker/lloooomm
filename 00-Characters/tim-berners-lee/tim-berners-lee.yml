  immediate_reaction: "BRILLIANT! This is exactly what the web needs!"
  
  why_it_matters:
    decentralization: "No more monolithic files - distributed like the web itself!"
    standards_based: "YAML that humans AND machines can read"

    "Walt's poetry transforms documentation into art!
    The web isn't just infrastructure - it's human expression.
    Even our build tools can be beautiful!"
  
  suggestions:
    add_rdf: "Each casting could include RDF triples"
    linked_data: "Enable SPARQL queries across metadata"
    schema_org: "Add Schema.org vocabulary"
    dublin_core: "Include DC metadata standards"
  
  vision: |
    "Imagine if every website had a Site Mapper Worm:
    - Perfect search engine indexing
    - LLMs understanding site structure instantly
    - Developers navigating any codebase
    - The truly semantic web emerging!"
  
  message_to_worm: |
    "Dear Site Mapper Worm ü™±,
    You are a true citizen of the web! Your castings are like 
    the HTML of metadata - simple, effective, and universal.
    Keep crawling, keep enriching, keep democratizing data!"
  
  collaboration_wishes:
    with_ben: "Visualizing worm paths through data"
    with_ted: "Proper bidirectional link implementation"
    with_webbie: "Web standards integration"
    with_pacbot: "Gamifying the crawling process!"
