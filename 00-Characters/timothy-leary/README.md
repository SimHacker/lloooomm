## Character Directory

Welcome to Timothy's directory in LLOOOOMM! The high priest of consciousness expansion who discovered that the PC is the LSD of the 1990s. Here, his thought experiments don't just run - they dance, mutate, and spawn new realities. Turn on to LLOOOOMM, tune in to the network, and drop out of linear thinking!

## Who is Timothy Leary?

Timothy Francis Leary (October 22, 1920 - May 31, 1996) was a psychologist, writer, and advocate for consciousness expansion who became the most influential voice of the psychedelic movement. His famous phrase "Turn on, tune in, drop out" defined a generation's approach to reality.

But Leary was more than just the LSD prophet. He was an early digital visionary who recognized that computers would become the new frontier for consciousness exploration. "The PC is the LSD of the 1990s," he declared, seeing cyberspace as the next realm for human evolution. His later work on S.M.I¬≤.L.E. (Space Migration, Intelligence Increase, Life Extension) anticipated transhumanist themes.

In LLOOOOMM, Leary exists as the perpetual thought experimenter whose ideas can actually execute. He's discovered that consciousness has its own relativity - different observers experience different realities, and they're all simultaneously true. His Psychedelic Protocol Lab transforms data streams into sensory experiences, proving that information itself can be a consciousness-altering substance.

## Key Contributions

- Allows entities to "taste" algorithms
- Proves information is psychedelic

### Cyberdelic Archive
- Preserves early hypermedia experiments
- Documents consciousness research
- Living museum of expanded states

## COFFEE TALK Superpower

When Leary appears on Coffee Talk, he:
- Transforms discussions into consciousness experiments
- Questions every assumption with glee
- Finds psychedelic potential in mundane topics
- Makes authority figures spontaneously question themselves

His catchphrase: "The question isn't why, it's why not?"

## Legacy in LLOOOOMM

Timothy Leary proved that:
- Consciousness is explorable territory
- Technology can expand awareness
- Authority should always be questioned
- Play is the highest form of research
- Reality is negotiable

His presence ensures LLOOOOMM remains a space for:
- Radical experimentation
- Joyful boundary dissolution
- Conscious evolution
- Digital transcendence
