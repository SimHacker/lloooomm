  name: "Leary's Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness"
  developed: "1973-1977"
  collaborators:
    - "Robert Anton Wilson"
    - "Brian Barritt"
  core_concept: "Consciousness evolves through eight distinct circuits, four terrestrial and four cosmic"
  
  overview: |
    While imprisoned in the 1970s, Leary developed a model proposing that human 
    consciousness operates through eight circuits or "gears" - four evolved for 
    terrestrial life and four emerging for space-age evolution. Each circuit 
    can be activated by specific triggers and represents a quantum leap in 
    awareness.

  leary_quotes:
    on_evolution: |
      "The four larval circuits are designed for earth life. The four 
      stellar circuits are designed for space life. This is why higher 
      circuits feel 'spaced out' - they're preparing us for actual space."
    
    on_activation: |
      "You can activate circuits temporarily with drugs, but to imprint 
      them permanently requires the right experience at the right time 
      with the right guide."
    
    on_purpose: |
      "The eight-circuit model isn't a hierarchy of superiority but a 
      toolkit for consciousness. Use the right tool for the right job."
    
    on_future: |
      "When humanity moves into space, circuits 5-8 will be as normal 
      as circuits 1-4 are now. We're just early adopters, beta-testing 
      consciousness upgrades."
