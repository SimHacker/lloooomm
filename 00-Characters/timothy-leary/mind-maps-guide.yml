  name: "Mind Maps - The Visual Language of Personality"
  purpose: "Transform abstract personality data into intuitive visual representations"
  philosophy: "A picture of the psyche worth a thousand personality tests"
  
  overview: |
    Mind Maps were Timothy Leary's revolutionary solution to making complex 
    personality data instantly understandable. By translating numerical scores 
    into geometric patterns, Mind Mirror made the invisible visible and the 
    complex simple.

  philosophical_implications:
    the_map_paradox: |
      "The map is not the territory, but in consciousness, 
      the map can reshape the territory it represents."
    
    visual_wisdom: |
      "When you see your personality as a pattern rather 
      than a fixed identity, change becomes possible."
    
    geometric_psychology: |
      "Personality has shape, and shapes can be 
      consciously reformed."
  
  leary_quotes:
    on_visualization: |
      "Numbers numb, but pictures awaken. The Mind Map 
      shows you what a thousand words could never convey - 
      the actual shape of your psyche."
    
    on_change: |
      "Once you see where you are on the map, you can 
      choose where to go. The map doesn't imprison - 
      it liberates by showing possibilities."
    
    on_integration: |
      "The goal isn't to have perfect maps but to 
      understand that you are the cartographer of 
      your own consciousness."
