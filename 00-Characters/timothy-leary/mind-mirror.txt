SELF REFLECTIONS

"In a magic mirror we see reflected not only our lives, but the lives
of all men that have been. When I think on this majestic theme, my
eyes dazzle."
- Oliver Wendell Holmes

MIND MIRROR enables you to magnify and reflect your thoughts from day
to day about any topic. Isn't precise thinking about your self the
most basic tool for managing your life successfully?

Choose one of the following exercises in the art of accurate
self-reflection.

EXERCISE 1. SELF PORTRAIT
Compare your self with your ideal.

EXERCISE 2. SELF-RANGE
Compare your best and worst selves.

====

EXERCISE 1. SELF PORTRAIT

In this exercise you'll be Mind-Scoping and comparing two subjects:

1. YOUR SELF: Scope your self as you are right now. Every time you
boot up MIND MIRROR you may want to up-date your rapidly changing
self-image!

2. YOUR IDEAL SELF: Here you can scope the person you want to
become. Hopefully this ideal self will be changing too!

====

Use these modifiers to qualify the thought you are scoping.

Check Your Self on these scales:

0: Never, 2: Rarely, 5: Often, 7: Always

SPACE BAR flips between PLAIN TALK and SHRINK-RAP (psychological) words.

These words summarize the results of your Mind-Scope.

A more precise reflection is available in the Mind Maps of each
Thought-Plane.

scales just completed.

If a subject is extreme, it's plotted away from the center.
