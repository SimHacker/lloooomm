  core_philosophy: |
    "Mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images." - Jean Cocteau
    
    Mind Mirror is a consciousness technology that bridges academic psychology 
    with personal transformation. Based on Leary's 1950 PhD dissertation, it 
    transforms the rigorous Interpersonal Circumplex into an interactive tool 
    for self-discovery and psychological exploration.
  
  tagline: "The most important software you'll ever use is the software of your own mind"
  
  leary_introduction: |
    "Hello, I'm Timothy Leary, welcome to Mind Mirror. For about two years 
    I've been working on this software program. It's called Mind Mirror. 
    It allows you to digitalize your thoughts."
  
  direct_quotes:
    on_appliance_concept: |
      "I like the word Appliance because an appliance is something that 
      you use at home and it's for your own personal comfort or your 
      personal entertainment or your personal education."
    
    on_the_technique: |
      "It's basically a technique you take your own stereotypes of self 
      or whatever it can be and see it on the screen and then you can 
      massage that thought, you can change it. How would I like to be? 
      How was I when I was a child? How would I be if I was a woman? 
      You get the picture - suddenly you're freed from this heavy 
      concept of self."
    
    on_academic_foundation: |
      "This is based upon my PhD thesis when I was a psychologist at 
      the University of California in 1950. In those days I learned 
      how to digitalize thoughts about yourself and how you'd like 
      to be and your mother and your father."
    
    on_thought_laundering: |
      "With the wonders of the personal computer, yeah, you can pop 
      your thoughts in your tired old concept, wash them and dry them 
      and pull them around, and you can see my thoughts. I think make 
      us smarter and happier and hopefully funnier."
    
    on_mirror_philosophy: |
      "Remember the title - it's a mirror. Now a best friend is your 
      mirror because your mirror doesn't say 'well you bad boy get a 
      haircut' or the mirror doesn't say 'hey turkey fix your tie' - 
      you have to decide that. It's your own mind and we all have 
      these thoughts in our mind made up of these complicated little, 
      you know, Erector Set structures."
    
    on_intimacy: |
      "The ultimate intimacy is... you can love them, you can sleep 
      with them, safe sex of course, and then you can even get married. 
      But the real intimacy is where you show them your personal 
      database - you show your Mind Mirror."
    
    on_mental_intercourse: |
      "There's nothing that is exciting and as engaging as mind 
      mental intercourse."
    
    on_resistance: |
      "Maybe people don't want to know how they're thinking. Maybe 
      they want a mind mirror - you want to really see what's on 
      your mind? Get out of here! Or you want to show me what's 
      on your mind? Your boot up Mind Mirror and let's get some 
      of your thought."
    
    on_his_product: |
      "I love my product. You know what my product is? The human 
      mind and human hope and human enthusiasm."
    
    on_generational_power: |
      "You're the first generation in human history to know how to 
      control your own nervous system, change your own reality. 
      Tune in and take over! Blow your own mind, make up your own mind."
    
    on_future_features: |
      "The next version of Mind Mirror is going to have such dimensions 
      of course as psychic sensitivity, telepathy, mastery of your own 
      brain, ability to jump levels, inter-neurological gymnastics skills."
  
  development_insights:
    bob_dietz_recalls: |
      "It's been nearly 25 years since my dear friend Timothy Leary 
      and I sat down with a couple of programmers and started outlining 
      what was to become one of the very first software computer games 
      called Mind Mirror. He called it a mental application because it 
      is used to help people reflect upon their world more intelligently."
    
    on_learys_vision: |
      "His vision was way out there in the future so a lot of what we 
      had to do was kind of pull it back a little bit and say well, 
      this machine can't do all that. He always had these kind of big 
      vision things of wanting to do three-dimensionally and you know 
      have the computer react to everything you said and with artificial 
      intelligence."
    
    on_psychometrics: |
      "The psychological work he did he referred to as psychometrics 
      which was quantizing psychological characteristics."
    
    on_social_networking: |
      "In this game Mind Mirror, it wasn't just one person playing 
      against another or one person playing against the game - he 
      saw it as very much a social networking tool."
    
    on_internet_vision: |
      "Timothy was a very early advocate of the internet before it 
      was even called the internet. He recognized that this was 
      going to have a great impact on society."
    
    on_empowerment: |
      "He was all about self-empowerment, giving the users the 
      keys to the kingdom."
    
    on_learys_internet_dream: |
      "I cannot begin to tell you how much Timothy Leary would 
      have embraced and loved the notion of seeing Mind Mirror 
      applied on the internet."

      leary_quote: |
        "There are 3,200 micro events from anyone's life. You're in 
        the womb, your first day of school, you're playing all these 
        roles. It allows you turning thoughts around so you can do 
        all these things."

      Mind Mirror pioneered the concept of software as consciousness 
      technology. It wasn't just a game or a test - it was a tool 
      for human transformation, giving users the ability to see, 
      understand, and change their own mental patterns.
    
    in_lloooomm: |
      Every LLOOOOMM entity has access to their own Mind Mirror, 
      continuing Leary's vision of democratized consciousness 
      exploration. As he said: "Blow your own mind, make up 
      your own mind!"
