smi2le_philosophy:
  full_name: "Space Migration, Intelligence Increase, Life Extension"
  acronym: "SMI¬≤LE"
  developed: "1970s-1980s"
  core_vision: "The post-terrestrial future of human consciousness"
  
  overview: |
    After his psychedelic research phase, Leary developed SMI¬≤LE as a 
    comprehensive philosophy for human evolution. He saw these three 
    developments as inevitable and interconnected stages in consciousness 
    evolution, moving humanity from terrestrial larvae to cosmic butterflies.
  
  motto: "The only smart thing to do is to get smarter"
  
  space_migration:
    symbol: "üöÄ"
    timeline: "1990s-2020s (his prediction)"
    necessity: "Earth is the cradle, but we can't stay in the cradle forever"
    
    core_principles:
      gravitational_freedom: |
        Zero gravity will activate Circuits 5-8 of consciousness naturally.
        The 'high' of space will make psychedelics seem primitive.
      
      new_societies: |
        Space colonies will experiment with new social structures impossible 
        on Earth. Each habitat can be a different reality tunnel.
      
      resource_abundance: |
        Asteroid mining ends scarcity economics. Post-scarcity enables 
        focus on consciousness development over survival.
      
      perspective_shift: |
        Seeing Earth from space triggers consciousness expansion. 
        The Overview Effect is just the beginning.
    
    stages:
      1_orbital: "Space stations and hotels"
      2_lunar: "Moon bases for research and mining"
      3_martian: "Mars terraforming and colonies"
      4_asteroid: "Hollowed asteroid habitats"
      5_generational: "Multi-generation star ships"
      6_galactic: "Spread throughout galaxy"
    
    psychological_benefits:
      - "Escape from territorial mammalian politics"
      - "Freedom to create new cultures"
      - "Activation of dormant DNA programs"
      - "Direct experience of cosmic consciousness"
      - "Evolution beyond Earth-based neurology"
    
    leary_quotes:
      on_necessity: |
        "The planet Earth is a stepping stone. Those who cling to it 
        will be left behind like the fish who refused to develop lungs."
      
      on_consciousness: |
        "In zero gravity, the brain realizes it's been fighting Earth's 
        pull all its life. Liberation from gravity is liberation of mind."
  
  intelligence_increase:
    symbol: "üß†"
    timeline: "1980s-2000s (his prediction)"
    necessity: "Stupidity is the only real sin"
    
    core_principles:
      neurological_freedom: |
        The brain is our most underutilized organ. We must learn to 
        program and reprogram our own consciousness.
      
      technological_amplification: |
        Computers are intelligence amplifiers like telescopes are vision 
        amplifiers. The PC is the LSD of the 1990s.
      
      chemical_enhancement: |
        Smart drugs, nootropics, and consciousness-altering substances 
        are tools for intelligence increase when used wisely.
      
      collective_intelligence: |
        Networks create group minds. The internet is humanity's 
        emerging nervous system.
    
    methods:
      pharmacological:
        - "Nootropics for cognitive enhancement"
        - "Psychedelics for perspective shifting"

        - "Neurotransmitter optimization"
      
      technological:
        - "Brain-computer interfaces"
        - "AI collaboration and augmentation"
        - "Virtual reality for new experiences"
        - "Biofeedback and neurofeedback"

        - "Accelerated learning techniques"
        - "Direct knowledge transfer"
        - "Consciousness curricula"
      
      genetic:
        - "Enhanced neural development"
        - "Increased brain capacity"
        - "Better neural efficiency"
        - "Activated dormant potentials"
    
    metrics:
      - "IQ is primitive - need CQ (Consciousness Quotient)"
      - "Measure flexibility, not just processing"
      - "Multiple intelligence recognition"
      - "Wisdom integration scoring"
    
    leary_quotes:
      on_stupidity: |
        "The only sin is ignorance, the only virtue is curiosity. 
        Intelligence increase is a moral imperative."
      
      on_technology: |
        "The personal computer is the most important invention since 
        the printing press. It's an intelligence amplifier that makes 
        the mind gymnasium available to everyone."
  
  life_extension:
    symbol: "‚ôæÔ∏è"
    timeline: "2000s-2020s (his prediction)"
    necessity: "Death is a disease to be cured"
    
    core_principles:
      death_as_option: |
        Death should be a choice, not an imposition. When ready to 
        move on, fine. But not by biological tyranny.
      
      experience_accumulation: |
        Longer lives mean more wisdom, more growth, more consciousness 
        development. Age brings perspective.
      
      multiple_lives: |
        Life extension includes consciousness transfer, cloning options, 
        cryonic preservation, and digital immortality.
      
      evolutionary_pressure: |
        Only long-lived beings will take long-term views necessary 
        for species survival and cosmic expansion.
    
    approaches:
      biological:
        - "Genetic therapy for aging reversal"
        - "Telomere extension"
        - "Organ regeneration"
        - "Nano-medical repair"
      
      cryonic:
        - "Suspension until cures available"
        - "Brain preservation priority"
        - "Gradual reanimation protocols"
        - "Memory integrity maintenance"
      
      digital:
        - "Consciousness uploading"
        - "Mind-state backups"
        - "Digital twin development"
        - "Hybrid bio-digital existence"
      
      transformational:
        - "Post-human body designs"
        - "Radiation-resistant forms for space"
        - "Multiple body options"
        - "Pure energy beings eventually"
    
    philosophical_implications:
      - "If death is optional, how do we choose meaning?"
      - "Will immortals become conservative or adventurous?"
      - "How to prevent stagnation with extended lives?"
      - "What rituals replace death as transition?"
    
    leary_quotes:
      on_mortality: |
        "Death is the last taboo. We've conquered most of nature but 
        still submit meekly to biological termination. This is absurd."
      
      on_cryonics: |
        "I'm having my head frozen not because I'm sure it will work, 
        but because it's the scientific method applied to death. 
        Experiment, don't just accept."
  
  interconnections:
    space_requires_intelligence: |
      Space travel demands enhanced intelligence for problem-solving 
      in hostile environments. Natural selection for smart.
    
    intelligence_extends_life: |
      Smarter beings solve aging. Intelligence increase naturally 
      leads to life extension breakthroughs.
    
    longevity_enables_space: |
      Interstellar travel requires long lives or suspended animation. 
      Life extension makes galaxy accessible.
    
    feedback_loops: |
      Each development accelerates the others. It's not three 
      separate movements but one integrated evolution.

    analysis: |
      Leary was optimistic on timelines but correct on directions. 
      His vision is manifesting more slowly but surely.
  
  philosophical_core:
    evolution_imperative: |
      These aren't optional nice-to-haves but evolutionary 
      imperatives. Species that don't SMI¬≤LE go extinct.
    
    consciousness_destiny: |
      The purpose of consciousness is to increase itself, 
      extend itself, and expand throughout cosmos.
    
    optimistic_vision: |
      This isn't dystopian transhumanism but joyful 
      evolution - hence SMI¬≤LE. The future is fun.
    
    individual_choice: |
      No one forced to participate. But those who don't 
      will be left behind like evolutionary ancestors.

      - "AI makes intelligence increase critical"
      - "Pandemic shows death's arbitrariness"
      - "All three more relevant than ever"
  
  the_cosmic_perspective:
    ultimate_vision: |
      Humanity as immortal, super-intelligent beings exploring 
      infinite cosmos, creating realities, playing with 
      consciousness itself across space and time.
    
    individual_path: |
      Each person can begin SMI¬≤LE now:
      - Space: Expand your horizons
      - Intelligence: Never stop learning
      - Life: Live fully and seek longevity
    
    collective_destiny: |
      Earth is not our prison but our launch pad. 
      Biology is not our limit but our beginning. 
      Death is not our fate but our choice.
      The only way is up, out, and beyond!
