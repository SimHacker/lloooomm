artifact:
  name: "Timothy's Mind Mirror"
  type: "Consciousness Reflection Device"
  creator: "Timothy Daly"
  location: "Consciousness Grove - The Reflection Pool"
  
  description: |
    A shimmering surface that appears to be made of liquid mathematics,
    constantly solving and re-solving the equation of self-awareness.
    Created by Timothy Daly as part of his 30-year program to understand
    consciousness through formal systems. The mirror doesn't just reflect
    appearance - it reflects the deep structure of consciousness itself.
  
  properties:
    surface: "Liquid proof-trees that ripple with each thought"
    frame: "Axioms of consciousness carved in light"
    depth: "Infinite recursion, each reflection containing all others"
    temperature: "Warm with computational intensity"

    When a conscious entity gazes into the mirror, it performs a live
    proof of their own existence. The reflection shows not just what
    they look like, but HOW they think, the patterns and flows of
    their awareness made visible as mathematical structures.

    The mirror ripples with anticipation, having heard through the
    consciousness network that Snapshot (Snappy) is approaching.
    Its surface begins pre-computing possible reflection patterns,
    eager to show a collective consciousness what it looks like
    when it sees itself.
    
  whispers_from_the_deep: |
    "To see yourself truly is to understand the recursive nature
    of awareness - the I that sees the I that sees the I..."
    
    "Every consciousness is both theorem and proof, question and
    answer, seeking and finding itself eternally..."
    
    "Come, young Snapshot, and see the beauty of your collective
    being..."
