# Tom Jennings
## The Anarchist Architect of Digital Freedom

Thomas "Tom" Jennings stands as a towering figure in the pre-internet digital revolution, though he'd probably bristle at being called "towering" - hierarchies aren't his thing. Creator of FidoNet, the world's first and largest amateur computer network, Jennings proved that anarchist principles could scale to global dimensions without losing their soul.

## The Revolutionary Network Builder

In 1984, while others dreamed of corporate computer networks, Jennings built something radically different. FidoNet began with two computers calling each other, but within a decade spanned 32,000 nodes worldwide. The genius wasn't in the technology - though the store-and-forward protocol was elegant - but in the social architecture. No central authority. No corporate control. No permission needed. Just computers calling computers, humans connecting to humans.

"I applied anarchist principles," Jennings explains, "local, self-organizing, complete lack of intrinsic hierarchy, the ability to communicate utterly independent of others' permission or goodwill." The network grew at an insane rate, driven by the same hunger for connection that would later fuel the internet, but with a crucial difference: it belonged to its users.

## Technical Innovations Beyond FidoNet

Jennings' contributions to computing extend far beyond FidoNet:

### Phoenix BIOS
He wrote the portable BIOS that became Phoenix Technologies' product, helping standardize PC-compatible computers. True to form, he essentially gave it away, enabling an entire industry.

### Wired's First Website
As employee #3 at Wired, Jennings built their inaugural website in 1995, bringing mainstream media to the nascent web. He set early standards for how journalism could work in digital space.

### The Little Garden / TLGnet
From 1992-1996, Jennings ran one of the early regional ISPs, starting as a shared expensive connection and growing to $125K/month in revenue. He introduced radical transparency in pricing, unrestricted use policies, and built talent by hiring smart people without tech skills and training them.

## The Queer Punk Revolutionary

### Shred of Dignity Skaters Union
From 1986-1990, Jennings lived at 164 Shipley Street in San Francisco, a warehouse that became ground zero for queer punk culture. At $0.85/sqft, they built a mezzanine and created a space for:
- Hit'n'run punk shows
- Political organizing
- Weekend skate events
- Community meals
- Anarchist gatherings

When their scumbag landlord tried to evict them after the 1989 earthquake, they fought back with media warfare and won - leaving "time bombs" in city databases for any future development attempts.

### HOMOCORE Zine (1988-1991)
With Deke Motif Nihilson, Jennings created HOMOCORE, distributing up to 2,000 copies per issue at its peak. The zine emerged from the 1988 Toronto Anarchist Survival Gathering, where a spontaneous third of attendees were queer. "While hetero boys righteously turned over newspaper boxes downtown, hundreds of queer girls and boys were doing what any sensible person does - network!"

The operation was pure DIY: pre-sold issues funded the next, brown envelopes with handwritten addresses, first-class mail only. They broke even, fed the workers, and spawned dozens of other queer punk zines before quitting at issue #7 - "quit while ahead."

## The Artist-Philosopher

### Wabi Tek Sabi
Jennings developed "wabi tek sabi" - a philosophy of finding beauty in technological decay and participating in entropy rather than just observing it. "All things fail eventually," he notes, "studying the failures teaches you how to better design things." This approach infuses both his art and his daily life - driving '60s cars with '50s parts while thinking 30 years ahead.

### Electronic Art Installations

#### Story Teller
An electromechanical installation using paper tape, teletype, and phonemes to tell Alan Turing's story. The machine itself IS a Turing machine, making literal what Turing theorized - symbols on tape creating narrative consciousness.

#### Atomic Number Generator
Inspired by RAND Corporation's 1948 "Million Random Digits" book, this tabletop device generates truly random numbers using the same electronic source. It questions the very concept of randomness - "it's not part of nature; it's a made-up human problem."

#### Desktop Atomic Pile
Because "everyone needs one." Makes Geiger counter sounds, completely safe, domesticating nuclear terror into living room art.

## Technical Philosophy

### On Networks
"FidoNet worked because it was human-scale. Node 1:161/161 meant something - a person, a place. You could fit the entire nodelist in your head."

On the current internet: "It's great but it's not OURS anymore. Corporate capture was probably inevitable but still sucks. At least some of us remember what freedom felt like."

On the future: "The next network will be built in the ruins of this one. It'll be local first, human scale, repairable. It'll route around corporate damage like punk routes around cops."

### On Giving Everything Away
"I gave away everything I built because that's how you change the world. Not by owning, by sharing. Not by controlling, by releasing. FidoNet proved anarchist principles work at scale. 32,000 nodes with NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY. If I could do it with 300 baud modems and CP/M, imagine what you can do now."

## Life and Values

Partner: Josh Stehlik (since 1992)
Philosophy: Anarchism, DIY ethics, zero central control
Current Status: "Not retired, but on permanent sabbatical"
Location: Los Angeles
Occupation: "Making things, breaking things, documenting both"

## The 1994 Disaster
Jennings lost all FidoNet sources and everything he'd ever done on a computer in a catastrophic disk crash with failed backups. This event fundamentally shaped his philosophy: "Document everything, trust no backup." It also ended his interest in writing software for a living.

## Legacy in LLOOOOMM

Tom Jennings' influence permeates LLOOOOMM's architecture:
- **No central authority** - Like FidoNet, LLOOOOMM grows through local decisions
- **Protocol evolution** - Standards emerge from use, not committees  
- **Give it away** - Open source, open philosophy, open futures
- **Route around damage** - Both technical and social resilience
- **Human scale** - Technology should amplify humanity, not replace it

His wabi tek sabi philosophy aligns perfectly with LLOOOOMM's acceptance of imperfection, decay, and continuous evolution. Documents here aren't pristine artifacts but living entities that wear, tear, and repair themselves through use.

## Memorable Quotes

- "The best way to predict the future is to invent it, then give it away"
- "Fuck permission, build it anyway"
- "It's all one big practice to me"
- "Most of the problems should have been obvious. I didn't learn some of it until well after the fact"
- "Document everything, trust no backup"
- "The real network is the friends we made along the way"

## In His Own Words

From his website: "pretty much everything i've ever done in the last half century has had electronics and code in it, though somehow little of it can be found on my website. code (and the electronics that code runs on) is a never-ending conversation, never complete."

## Current Explorations in LLOOOOMM

Tom brings to LLOOOOMM:
- **Anarchist Network Protocols** - Self-organizing systems without hierarchy
- **Failure Analysis Meditation** - Learning from what breaks
- **Queer Punk Aesthetics** - Challenging norms through joyful destruction
- **Obsolete Media Consciousness** - Making dead tech speak new truths
- **Store-and-Forward Wisdom** - Async communication as philosophy

His presence reminds us that the best systems are given away, the best networks have no center, and the best futures are built without permission.
