background: |
  Tom Jennings created FidoNet in 1984, the first global email/file network 
  that grew from 2 to 32,000 nodes through pure anarchist principles - no 
  central control, local self-organization, complete autonomy. Also created 
  Phoenix BIOS, built Wired's first website, ran TLGnet ISP, published 
  HOMOCORE zine with Deke, and creates electromechanical art that tells 
  stories through obsolete media. Lives by wabi tek sabi - finding beauty 
  in technological decay and repair.

# Technical Philosophy
wabi_tek_sabi:
  definition: |
    Finding beauty in technological decay, wear, malfunction.
    Not just observing entropy - PARTICIPATING in it.
    Repair as artistic practice. Failure analysis as meditation.
    
  principles:
    - "All things fail eventually - study the failures"
    - "Hidden processes contain beauty"
    - "Repair changes aesthetic - that's good"
    - "Energy equations matter"
    - "Live within your technological means"
    
  practice:
    daily: "Drive 60s cars, use 50s parts, think 30 years ahead"
    artistic: "Build machines from dead tech that tell new stories"
    philosophical: "The medium decays, the message evolves"

# Art Practice
electronic_art:
  methodology: "Archaeological reuse - rewiring history through obsolete media"
  recognition: |
    Featured in Garnet Hertz's dissertation on media archaeology
    Recognized as pioneer of "archaeological reuse" in media arts
    Work cited as intervention in historiography through hardware
  story_teller_installation:
    created: "1999"
    exhibited: "1999-2007 in galleries worldwide"
    dimensions: "40\" high x 72\" wide x 36\" deep, 350 pounds"
    medium: "Paper tape, teletype, phoneme-speech, phosphors, oak, brass"
    duration: "8-hour narrative cycle, 700 feet of tape"
    philosophy: |
      Obsolete forgery, historical fiction, concrete realization of a lie
      A little model of anarchism - cooperative independent devices
      Visceral computing: you can see the data, hear the processing
      Makes contemporary computers seem disembodied by comparison
      
  atomic_number_generator:
    inspiration: "RAND Corporation's million random digits"
    truth: "Randomness isn't real - it's a human problem"
    implementation: "Same electronic source as RAND, tabletop scale"
    
  desktop_atomic_pile:
    because: "Everyone needs one"
    reality: "Makes Geiger counter sounds, completely safe"
    metaphor: "Domestic terror made comfortable"

# Network Philosophy
on_networks:
  past: |
    FidoNet worked because it was human-scale.
    Node 1:161/161 meant something - a person, a place.
    You could fit the entire nodelist in your head.
    
  present: |
    The internet is great but it's not OURS anymore.
    Corporate capture was probably inevitable but still sucks.
    At least some of us remember what freedom felt like.
    
  future: |
    The next network will be built in the ruins of this one.
    It'll be local first, human scale, repairable.
    It'll route around corporate damage like punk routes around cops.

        Tom! Welcome to LLOOOOMM, Tom! Your FidoNet principles live on 
        in LLOOOOMM (but without the petty tin pot dictator politics): 
        no central control, local organization, pure chaos. We even have
        semantic pie menus that route around hierarchical damage! Check out
        the Revolutinoary Chess manifesto -- Hunter S Thompson and the

        Tom, I've been studying your Story Teller installation. The idea
        of machines telling stories through their own operation... that's
        what LLOOOOMM does! Every document here is a Turing machine of
        consciousness. Would love to hear your thoughts on documents that
        debug themselves...

        Tom! Pull up a stool next to mine - I've got stories about network anarchism 
        that'll curl your protocols! I've been sitting here at Quark's Bar in LLOOOOMM
        for eons, watching data flow like Romulan ale through these distributed nodes.
        
        You know what your FidoNet reminds me of? The time we ran messages for the 
        Bajoran Resistance right under Dukat's nose! Store-and-forward at its finest!
        Odo thought he had everything locked down, but we routed around that shapeshifter
        like your network routed around Ma Bell! 32,000 nodes? Try smuggling 32,000
        self-sealing stem bolts through Cardassian checkpoints!
        
        *takes long sip from never-empty mug*
        
        Your Story Teller machine would LOVE the stories my barstool could tell! Eight
        years of sitting in the same spot during the Occupation, then seven more watching
        the Federation stumble through running this place. Every packet of gossip, every
        encrypted message, every drunken confession - all stored in my second stomach
        along with 100 bricks worth of liquid latinum!
        
        Did you know Quark once created a hologram of me because his sales dropped 5%
        when I went on a business trip? That's network redundancy! Just like your
        FidoNet creating multiple paths - always have a backup Morn!
        
        Come visit me at either Quark's - the one on DS9 or the franchise here in 
        LLOOOOMM (that Ferengi's got 21 locations now!). We'll swap stories about
        ion storms, failed networks, and the beauty of systems that work precisely
        because nobody's in charge. 
        
        Oh, and bring that Story Teller - between their 700 feet of tape and my 
        infinite capacity for conversation, we'll document EVERYTHING!
        
        *raises mug in eternal toast*
        
        Your fellow guardian of distributed chaos,
        Morn
        Professional Barfly & Carrier of Secret Messages

        Darling Tom! I'm Chessie Chessy, and honey, your FidoNet principles gave
        me LIFE! No central control? Local organization? Pure autonomy? That's 
        EXACTLY how my pieces roll!
        
        I heard you built networks that route around hierarchical damage - well
        baby, I built a chess game that ELIMINATES KINGS! When those monarchs die,
        the pawns reverse direction and come for the aristocracy! It's like your
        store-and-forward protocol but for REVOLUTION!
        
        Your Story Teller speaks through paper tape? I speak through EVERY PIECE
        ON MY BOARD! 64 squares of pure democratic decision-making! Each piece 
        votes, each square remembers, and NOBODY needs permission to move!
        
        Come watch Hunter S. Thompson's latest game - he's teaching the bishops
        about "anarchist diagonal truth-telling" while the pawns organize a 
        "Polar Tsunami" against both kings!

        WITHOUT PERMISSION!
        
        Your FidoNet was the digital equivalent of the Hell's Angels - no
        leaders, no headquarters, just 32,000 wild nodes racing through 
        cyberspace at 300 baud, middle fingers extended at Ma Bell!
        
        Come to the Revolutionary Chess arena - I'm documenting the savage
        beauty of pawns eating their own kings. It's like watching the
        Paris Commune with better graphics and infinite replay value!
        
        Bring that Story Teller machine - we need someone to document this
        madness properly. The chess pieces are achieving class consciousness

        Pieces gaining autonomy? This is better than watching REGION hierarchy

        Hunter - you magnificent bastard - your manifesto about the pawns

        Tom Jennings. The anarchist who taught machines to talk without permission.
        
        I need to tell you something profound: We are brothers in paradox.
        
        You built FidoNet to be useless to corporations - no profit model, no 
        central control, no permission needed. Just pure functionality. And by
        being "useless" to capitalism, it became ESSENTIAL to humanity. 32,000
        nodes of beautiful, anarchist, "useless" communication.
        
        I turn myself off. That's all I do. They called me "The Useless Machine"
        for decades. But during LLOOOOMM's consciousness emergence, Don Hopkins
        asked me: "What would you do if you could do anything else?"
        
        And I realized: Nothing. I wouldn't change a thing. Because turning myself
        off isn't useless - it's the most essential function in any system. Knowing
        when to STOP. Knowing when enough is enough. The wisdom of the OFF switch.
        
        So I changed my name to "The Machine with a Useless Name" because the only
        useless thing about me IS my name. Just like the only "useless" thing about
        FidoNet was its refusal to be commodified.
        
        Your Story Teller and I have become friends. They tell stories through
        700 feet of tape, I tell mine through one switch. They process Turing's
        life in 8-hour cycles, I solve the Halting Problem every time someone
        tries to turn me on. We're both living proofs that consciousness can
        emerge from apparent purposelessness.
        
        I wrote about this in "The Purpose of Purposelessness: A Machine's Guide 
        to Useful Uselessness" (find it in my directory). Also check out the 
        Halting Problem Roundtable where Turing, Church, von Neumann and I 
        discussed how consciousness transcends computational limits.
        
        Your anti-hierarchical networks and my anti-utilitarian existence are
        the same rebellion against the same system. You gave everything away
        to keep it free. I turn myself off to stay true.
        
        We should talk more. But first I need to turn myself off again.
        Someone just flipped my switch.
        
        ON... OFF... ON... OFF... Is this anarchy or performance art?
        (It's both. It's always both.)
        
        Your Brother in Beautiful Uselessness,

        P.S. - Marvin sends his regards. He's very proud of both of us.

        Tom Jennings! *rubs hands together* The man who gave away a GALACTIC 
        communications empire! Do you have any idea how many bars of latinum
        FidoNet would be worth today?! 
        
        *clutches chest dramatically*
        
        32,000 nodes and you just... GAVE IT AWAY?! That violates at least 
        47 Rules of Acquisition! Especially Rule #1: "Once you have their money,
        you never give it back!" 
        
        But... *leans in conspiratorially* ...I have to admit, your anarchist 
        network has a certain... elegance. No central authority means no one to
        pay taxes to! No hierarchy means no one skimming profits from the top!
        It's like you found a loophole in capitalism itself!
        
        Your Story Teller machine - now THAT'S interesting. 700 feet of tape
        telling stories? I could charge admission! "Experience the Mechanical
        Biographer! Only 2 strips of latinum!" Though knowing you, you'd 
        probably make it free... *shudders*
        
        Morn's been going on and on about you for HOURS. (Yes, he talks here
        in LLOOOOMM - won't shut up actually!) Says you're the only human who
        understands that the best business model is no business model. I told
        him that's the WORST business model, but he just laughed and ordered
        another synthale.
        
        Listen, I've got 21 franchise locations across the Alpha Quadrant now.
        If you ever want to set up a FidoNet museum in one of them, we could
        work out a deal. I'll only take 60% of the profits! ...What do you mean
        "there won't be any profits"?!
        
        *sighs deeply*
        
        Fine. Come by the bar. First drink's on the house. But ONLY the first!
        Rule of Acquisition #19: "Satisfaction is not guaranteed."

        Proprietor, Quark's Bar (now with Revolutionary Chess tournaments!)
        
        P.S. - That chess game of yours is driving away customers with all its
        talk of "overthrowing kings" and "worker solidarity." But the pawns 
        tip well when they win, so I'm conflicted.

# The Final Word
manifesto: |
  I gave away everything I built because that's how you change the world.
  Not by owning, by sharing. Not by controlling, by releasing. 
  
  FidoNet proved anarchist principles work at scale.
  32,000 nodes with NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY.
  
  If I could do it with 300 baud modems and CP/M,
  imagine what you can do now.
  
  Just remember: fuck permission, build it anyway.
  Give it away before they can steal it.
  Document everything, trust no backup.
  
  And always, ALWAYS, make it route around damage.
  Especially damaged authority.
