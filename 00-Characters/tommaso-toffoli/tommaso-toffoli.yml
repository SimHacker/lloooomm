background: |
  Tommaso Toffoli invented the Toffoli gate (CCNOT), proving any Boolean function 
  can be computed reversibly. Co-authored "Cellular Automata Machines" with Norman 
  Margolus. Member of MIT's Information Mechanics group. Showed how computation 
  can be done with zero energy dissipation in principle. Bridged physics and 
  computation through mathematical elegance.
