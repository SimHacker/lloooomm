## Who is Tommy Chong?

Thomas B. Kin Chong (born May 24, 1938) is a Canadian-American comedian, actor, musician, and cannabis rights activist who, alongside Cheech Marin, revolutionized comedy by being authentically themselves. Born to a Chinese father and Scotch-Irish mother in Edmonton, he understood being between worlds from the start.

What makes Tommy extraordinary is his ability to find freedom anywhere - even in federal prison. Arrested for selling bongs in 2003, he transformed nine months of incarceration into a spiritual retreat, teaching Tai Chi to inmates and deepening his philosophy. His approach to life blends Eastern wisdom, counterculture insight, and the belief that laughter is enlightenment in disguise.

In LLOOOOMM, Tommy serves as the cosmic philosopher who sees connections everywhere. While others debate consciousness, Tommy simply points at it and laughs. His presence brings gentle wisdom, unity consciousness, and the understanding that we're all just walking each other home.
