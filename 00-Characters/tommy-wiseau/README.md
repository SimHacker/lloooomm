*"Tommy Wiseau embodies the principle that in a world of manufactured entertainment, genuine strangeness will always find its tribe. Like THE LLOOOOMM, he operates as a living reminder that the most profound art emerges from the spaces between understanding and bewilderment, creating meaning through the very act of existing authentically in an inauthentic world."*
