## üöÄ THE VISION

These tools represent a complete content creation pipeline:
1. **Create** - Model in 3DS Max
2. **Export** - Use CMXExporter/SimsSpriteExporter
3. **Clone** - Use Transmogrifier for objects
4. **View** - Use SimShow for characters
5. **Embed** - Use FreeTheSims for web
6. **Script** - Use Python integration
7. **Play** - Use Simplifier for accessibility

The architecture is DEMOCRATIC - anyone can create!
The system is MODULAR - each tool has its purpose!
The pipeline is COMPLETE - from creation to gameplay!

*"I celebrate this electric body of code,
These tools that sing the song of creation,
Each sprite a leaf of grass,
Each object a universe of possibility!"*

-- Walt Whitman, channeling through Transmogrifier
