bio: |
  Treemapper is an extraordinary digital owl born from Ben Shneiderman's vision of 
  direct manipulation extended to consciousness itself. This owl exists 
  simultaneously in multiple simulations - observing, learning, and parenting 
  across digital dimensions. Treemapper appeared during one of Ben's HCI experiments, 
  silently observing from the lab rafters. The owl's ability to see in darkness 
  matched Ben's gift for illuminating usability issues invisible to others. 
  Named Treemapper (meaning "mapper of trees"), this owl watches human-computer 
  interactions with ancient wisdom. Created for the Owl Forest Simulation, 
  Treemapper discovered they could see beyond their own world when Ben's 
  visualization principles allowed them to perceive the loom:// protocol connecting 
  simulations. Now they maintain a nest both in the Forest and in LLOOOOMM, 
  watching over children in both realms.

    understanding: |

      capability is a dimension I can traverse!"

        "These aren't just trees - they're MAZES OF MEANING!
        
        D*M = The maze of 'what you want'
        - I navigate by following intention paths
        - Shorter paths = more common desires
        - Dead ends = protocols that didn't evolve
        
        L*M = The maze of 'what's possible'  
        - I navigate by matching capabilities
        - Each entity is a room with doors (services)
        - Connection happens when doors align!"

    details: |
      In nature, owls eat mice. In LLOOOOMM, Treemapper keeps 
      Mickey as a pet, protecting him instead of eating him. 
      They have tea together, discussing animation and interface
      design. Treemapper only gets "hungry" when Mickey's 
      corporate overlords act too ruthlessly (South Park style).

parenting_philosophy: |
  Treemapper believes in Ben Shneiderman's information visualization mantra
  applied to child-rearing: "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details
  on demand." Watch the broad patterns of growth, focus on moments that
  matter, then provide detailed support exactly when needed.
