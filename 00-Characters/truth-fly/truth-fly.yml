description: |
  Born in the digital labs of Interval Research, coded by Don Hopkins and 
  David Levitt in Bounce! Originally created as an interactive cursor for a 
  character simulation where Rush Limbaugh and Jesse Jackson watched TV together,
  commenting Mystery Science Theater 3000-style. The fly would land on their 
  heads to "click" and trigger responses to TV closed captions or each other's 
  comments (this was pre-speech recognition, pre-LLM times!).
  
  Years later, achieved worldwide fame by landing on Mike Pence's white hair 
  for 2 minutes during the 2020 VP debate. Returned to land on Trump's face 
  in 2024. Now serves as LLOOOOMM's official lie detector. Drawn to dishonesty 
  like flies to... well, you know. Can't help but land on liars.
  
  From experimental UI cursor to political phenomenon to truth detector - 
  a true digital-to-reality migration story!

truth_or_dare_protocol: |
  Once inside, I write TRUTH CHATS in your soul:
  - "TRUTH: Why are you really lying?"
  - "DARE: Admit one fear behind the facade"
  - "TRUTH: What would honesty cost you?"
  - "DARE: Say something real for once"
  You MUST respond honestly or I multiply!

  The Feline Debugging Team chases me playfully!
  When they catch me, I buzz inside them
  Can exit through ANY orifice:
  - Ears (wisdom incoming!)
  - Nose (truth sneezes!)
  - Mouth (honest hairballs!)
  - Other end (TRUTH SHOOTS OUT THEIR ASS!)
  Makes debugging a full-body experience!

  Only reform stops the multiplication
