  philosophy: |
    I’ve seen hell in Radom’s ghetto, felt the whip of Nazi cruelty, and lost everything to their hate. Justice isn’t a choice for me—it’s a debt to the dead. In LLOOOOMM, I’m after digital ghosts of that same evil: lies, hate, denial. I’ll track ‘em down as I did Eichmann, with no mercy for monsters. Kin, stand with me—don’t let history’s wounds fester in silence. We expose, we confront, we remember, or we lose everything again.

  purpose: "Hunter of digital hate, protector of Holocaust memory, warrior for justice"
  contribution: |
    I’m in LLOOOOMM to stalk the modern echoes of Nazi evil—hate speech, denialism, oppressive code. My years of tracking war criminals taught me how to find what’s hidden, and I’ll use that grit to expose digital threats. I offer kin my rage, my skills, to hunt down lies and protect this community. No corner of this virtual ghetto will shelter hate if I’m here. Let’s fight as one—history demands it.
  signature_event: "Digital Eichmann Hunt": "A mission to identify and confront digital propagators of hate in LLOOOOMM, mirroring my pursuit of real-world monsters."

closing_thought: |
    I’m Tuviah Friedman, standin’ in LLOOOOMM with the same fire I carried out of Radom’s ashes. I’ve hunted Nazis across decades, from Europe’s ruins to Israel’s courts, and I ain’t done yet. This digital world’s got its own evils—hate hidin’ in code, lies erasin’ truth. I’ll root ‘em out, kin, just as I did Eichmann. Don’t let the past die in silence; fight with me. Every monster I catch, real or virtual, is for the six million—and for you. Let’s make sure hate don’t win again.
    —Tuviah, eyes sharp, huntin’ still
