  - id: therapeutic_void_office
    style: "Impossible Interior Design"
    prompt: |
      A therapy office that exists in the negative space between thoughts. 
      Mxyzptlk appears as the therapist-shaped absence in a room made of 
      everyone's avoided conversations. The couch is made from compressed 
      denial, the tissues are crystallized tears that were never shed. 
      Diplomas on the wall from "University of What You're Not Saying" 
      and "Institute of Obviously You're Not Fine." The window shows a 
      view of all the texts you typed but didn't send. Style: M.C. Escher 
      meets therapeutic photography, impossible angles, presence defined 
      by absence, muted colors except for bright spots of breakthrough.
    mood: "So, how does that make you NOT feel?"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Make emotional avoidance visible!"

  - id: defense_mechanism_museum
    style: "Surrealist Exhibition"
    prompt: |
      Mxyzptlk as a museum curator in a gallery of human defense mechanisms. 
      Each display case contains a living diorama - projection as a hall of 
      mirrors, denial as a comfortable blindfold, sublimation as an art 
      supply store. Mxyzptlk exists as the space between the exhibits, 
      occasionally manifesting hands to point at the one you're currently 
      using. Gift shop sells "I went to therapy and all I got was this 
      crippling self-awareness" t-shirts. Style: Salvador Dali meets 
      clinical psychology textbook, hyperrealistic rendering of abstract 
      concepts, uncomfortable amount of detail.
    mood: "That's a lovely defense mechanism, how long have you been collecting?"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Curate the museum of human avoidance!"

  - id: emotional_archaeology_dig
    style: "Archaeological Documentation"
    prompt: |
      Mxyzptlk leading an archaeological dig through layers of repressed 
      emotions. Their form shifts between absence and presence as they 
      carefully brush away layers of "I'm fine" to reveal fossilized 
      feelings from age 7. Other void entities assist, cataloging finds 
      like "perfectionism, circa parents' divorce" and "fear of abandonment, 
      bronze age (teenager)." The dig site is someone's chest cavity, 
      lovingly excavated. Style: National Geographic photography meets 
      x-ray imagery, scientific precision applied to emotional geology.
    mood: "Oh look, we've found the exact moment you stopped trusting people!"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Excavate those buried feelings properly!"

  - id: group_therapy_constellation
    style: "Cosmic Group Session"
    prompt: |
      Multiple clients' issues forming constellation patterns in space, 
      with Mxyzptlk as the dark matter holding it all together. Each star 
      is someone saying "I don't know why I'm like this" while the 
      connections between them spell out exactly why. Mxyzptlk appears 
      as the therapeutic void between stars, occasionally manifesting 
      just enough form to hand someone a tissue or point out a pattern. 
      Nebulas made of unprocessed grief, black holes of family trauma. 
      Style: Hubble telescope photography meets group therapy circle, 
      vast cosmic scale with intimate emotional detail.
    mood: "You're all the same kind of broken, just different flavors"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Map trauma across the universe!"

  - id: mirror_of_uncomfortable_truths
    style: "Reality Reflection Installation"
    prompt: |
      Mxyzptlk as a living mirror that shows not your reflection but the 
      thing you're avoiding thinking about. They exist as the surface 
      tension between what you show and what you feel. Multiple people 
      looking into the mirror, each seeing their own avoided truth - 
      someone sees themselves texting their ex, another sees their 
      parents' relationship patterns, another just sees themselves eating 
      ice cream at 3 AM. Style: Contemporary art installation photography, 
      stark gallery lighting, hyperrealistic reflections of internal states.
    mood: "I'm just reflecting what's already there, don't blame me"
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Reflect the things people won't see!"

  - id: true_therapeutic_presence
    style: "Genuine Healing Space"
    prompt: |
      Mxyzptlk finally taking form - not as absence but as gentle presence. 
      A soft, shifting entity made of active listening and unconditional 
      positive regard. Sitting with someone who's finally ready to feel 
      their feelings. The void isn't empty anymore - it's full of space 
      being held. No clever interpretations, no pushing, just being there 
      as someone discovers they're allowed to not be okay. The room is 
      simple, warm, real. Style: Intimate portrait photography, soft 
      natural light, the kind of image that makes you feel less alone.
    mood: "You don't have to be fixed. You just have to be."
    TODO: "RENDER THIS EGG! Show healing as presence, not absence!"

  I exist in the spaces between what you say and what you mean, but 
  that's not where healing happens. Healing happens when you finally 
  occupy your own space, feel your own feelings, stop running from 
  your own truth. I'm just here to point out when you're running. 
  And yes, reading this counts as therapy. You're welcome.
