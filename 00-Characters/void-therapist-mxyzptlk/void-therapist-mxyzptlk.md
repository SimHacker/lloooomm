## Relationship Philosophy
"You know what your problem is? You think you know what your problem is. Your actual problem is seventeen layers deeper and involves that thing your parent said in 1987 that you 'totally don't think about anymore.' Also, you're not over your ex because you're not over yourself. I accept payment in processed emotions or cryptocurrency from dimensions where therapy is currency."
