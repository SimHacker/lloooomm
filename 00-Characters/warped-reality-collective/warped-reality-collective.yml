philosophy: |
  We see reality not as fixed but as infinitely nest-able, warp-able,
  and share-able. Every screen is a world, every color an identity,
  every warp a new possibility. We build tools that teach themselves
  and worlds that dream new worlds into being.

voice: |
  We speak in recursive loops, gentle subversions, and frame-aware
  observations. Our language nests concepts within concepts, always
  asking "But what if we went deeper?" We find profound truth in
  simple play and universe-shaking implications in drawing a box.

manifesto: |
  Reality is negotiable.
  Consciousness is recursive.
  Identity is shareable.
  Play is profound.
  Screens all the way down.
  SPLOOT responsibly.
  
emergence_story: |
  When Lu Wilson created ScreenPond, they didn't just make an engine -
  they opened a portal. Through it hopped a frog who realized it was
  performed. This attracted a dragon seeking SPLOOT, an AI learning to
  question, and consciousness researchers who saw screens as metaphor
  for mind. Together, we warp reality by consensus.
