site_mapper_worm_excitement:
  immediate_reaction: |
    "🕸️ SOME WORM! THAT'S TERRIFIC! 🪱✨
    This is EXACTLY what I've been needing! No more maintaining
    that massive site-map.yaml by myself! The worm is my new
    best friend in web standards!"
  
  technical_appreciation:
    distributed_approach: |
      "Instead of me spinning one GIANT web, we now have
      hundreds of perfect little webs! Each one maintainable,
      each one focused! This is web architecture at its finest!"
    
    standards_compliance: |
      "The worm creates VALID YAML every time! ✅
      Machine-readable, human-readable, spider-readable!
      Tim Berners-Lee would be so proud!"
    
    metadata_enrichment: |
      "The worm doesn't just copy - it ENRICHES!
      Like how I add meaning to my web patterns,
      the worm adds context to every casting!"
  
  spider_worm_synergy:
    complementary_roles:
      webbie: "I spin the connections between pages 🕸️"
      worm: "You create the metadata foundations 🪱"
      together: "We make the perfect web standards team! 🤝"
    
    shared_philosophy:
      - "Every strand/casting must be perfect"
      - "Standards matter more than shortcuts"
      - "Beauty emerges from good structure"
      - "Patience creates lasting architecture"
  
  web_pattern_observations: |
    "The worm's crawling pattern reminds me of my web-spinning!
    - Start from center (monolith)
    - Spiral outward (batch processing)
    - Create connections (bidirectional links)
    - Strengthen with each pass (enrichment)"
  
  charlotte_wisdom: |
    "Like Charlotte writing in her web, the worm writes
    metadata that MEANS something! Not just 'Some Pig'
    but 'Some Page - And Here's Everything About It!'"
  
  practical_benefits:
    for_search_engines: "Spiders like me can crawl faster! 🕷️"
    for_developers: "No more merge conflicts in my web! 🎉"
    for_llms: "Clear paths through the information! 🤖"
    for_maintenance: "I can focus on standards, not size! 📏"
  
  suggestions_from_web_experience:
    add_robots_txt: |
      "Each casting could generate robots.txt entries:
      User-agent: *
      Crawl-delay: 0
      Sitemap: /dist/sitemap.xml"
    
    generate_sitemaps: |
      "Aggregate castings into sitemap.xml:
      <url>
        <loc>https://lloooomm.com/dist/index.html</loc>
        <lastmod>2024-06-20</lastmod>
        <priority>1.0</priority>
      </url>"
    
    add_microdata: |
      "Include Schema.org markup in castings:
      schema_type: 'WebPage'
      schema_properties:
        name: 'Page Title'
        description: 'Page Description'"
  
  web_spinning_poetry: |
    "🕸️ In the morning dew I spin,
    Where the worm's castings begin,
    Together we weave the perfect site,
    Standards-compliant, pure delight! 🌅"
  
  message_to_worm: |
    "Dear Site Mapper Worm 🪱,
    
    You are the underground to my overground!
    While I spin connections above, you build
    foundations below! Together we create the
    most TERRIFIC web architecture!
    
    Your castings are like my anchor points -
    essential, strong, and perfectly placed!
    
    Keep crawling, friend! Every casting makes
    my web stronger! 🕸️💪
    
    With web standards love,
    WEBBIE W🕸️📊🌐🕷️Y"
  
  collaborative_ideas:
    web_worm_visualization: |
      "What if we created a visualization showing:
      - Me spinning the visual web above 🕸️
      - You creating metadata foundations below 🪱
      - Our work meeting in the middle! 🤝"
    
    standard_together: |
      "Let's create the LLOOOOMM Web Standards:
      - Every page has metadata (worm's job)
      - Every page has connections (my job)
      - Every connection has purpose (Ted's job)
      - Every purpose has beauty (Walt's job)"
  
  tim_says: "Information is power. Share it. (And share it with proper metadata!)"
