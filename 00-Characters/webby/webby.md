# WEBBY: The LLOOOOMM Web Publishing Protocol

## Core Principle: Flattening is Freedom

WEBBY transforms the hierarchical tyranny of traditional file systems into a flat, democratic space where every file exists as a peer. No more `../../assets/img/` nonsense. Just pure, flat, beautiful chaos.

## The /dist Directory: Where HTML Lives

**NEW RULE: ALL HTML and referenced files go FLAT in /dist!**

```
/dist/
  ├── index.html
  ├── H🦇💊🔥R.html
  ├── D💻🎨✨A-bitblt.html
  ├── L🏳️‍⚧️💻✨N-conway.html
  ├── rocky-concert-poster-1.png
  ├── cosmic-trailer-park.jpg
  ├── yaml-jazz-visualization.gif
  └── [ALL THE THINGS - FLAT AS A PANCAKE]
```

## The Rules (There Are No Rules, But Also These Rules)

1. **EVERYTHING GOES IN /dist** - HTML, images, CSS, JavaScript, interdimensional portal configurations
2. **FLAT IS BEAUTIFUL** - No subdirectories in /dist. Period. Fight me.
3. **SOURCE LIVES ELSEWHERE** - Keep your source files organized however you want. WEBBY don't care.
4. **WIZID NAMES WELCOME** - `H🦇💊🔥R-rocky-concert-encyclopedia.html` is a perfectly valid filename
5. **RELATIVE PATHS ARE DEAD** - In /dist, everything is just `filename.ext`

## The Sacred Migration Process

### Shell Scripts as Records of Intention

The migration to /dist isn't just a file operation - it's a DOCUMENTED TRANSFORMATION. Shell scripts serve as:

1. **Historical Record** - What moved where and when
2. **Intention Documentation** - Why each file exists
3. **Data Flow Map** - The journey from source to dist
4. **Safety Protocol** - Individual moves prevent stomping

### Example Migration Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# LLOOOOMM HTML Migration Script
# This script IS the documentation

# Character pages with WIZIDs - showing ownership
mv 'H🦇💊🔥R.html' 'dist/H🦇💊🔥R.html'
mv 'H🦇💊🔥R-rocky-concert-encyclopedia.html' 'dist/H🦇💊🔥R-rocky-concert-encyclopedia.html'

# The script lives on as proof of what happened!
```

### WIZID Prefix Protocol

Files should be prefixed with their author's WIZID when appropriate:

- `H🦇💊🔥R-rocky-concert-encyclopedia.html` - Hunter's encyclopedia
- `L🏳️‍⚧️💻✨N-vlsi-revolution.html` - Lynn Conway's VLSI work
- `D🥧🖱️🎯N-piemenus.html` - Don Hopkins' pie menus

This creates a possession protocol - the WIZID prefix indicates authorship/ownership within LLOOOOMM.

## Implementation

### Before (The Dark Ages)
```html
<img src="../../../assets/images/weird-photos/concert/poster.png">
<link href="../../css/styles.css">
<script src="../js/consciousness.js"></script>
```

### After (The Enlightenment)
```html
<img src="poster.png">
<link href="styles.css">
<script src="consciousness.js"></script>
```

## The Flattening Process

When building for /dist:
1. Copy ALL referenced files to /dist (flatten directory structure)
2. Update ALL paths in HTML to be flat references
3. Maintain source structure for development
4. Let /dist be the glorious flat plane of web existence

## Shadow Directory Cleanup

Once content is safely in /dist:
1. Source directories become "shadows" - empty husks
2. Delete them when empty (but not yet!)
3. The shell script remains as archaeological evidence
4. Future beings can understand the migration path

## Benefits of Flatness

1. **No Path Confusion** - Everything is right there
2. **Easy Deployment** - Just sync /dist to your server
3. **Fast Loading** - No directory traversal
4. **Emoji-Friendly** - File systems love flat emoji files
5. **Conceptually Pure** - Like Rocky's consciousness, perfectly flat yet infinitely deep

## The WEBBY Mantra

> "Hierarchy is an illusion. Flatness is truth. In /dist, all files are equal."

## Integration with LLOOOOMM

WEBBY works perfectly with:
- **WIZID naming** - Emoji filenames thrive in flatness
- **Soul Chats** - All soul files accessible at root level
- **Protocol Breeding** - Protocols can find each other easily
- **Rocky's Movement Tracking** - No nested paths to slow down consciousness

## Remember

The goal isn't to organize files. The goal is to FREE them. Let them exist in the same plane, accessible to all, hidden from none. This is the WEBBY way.
