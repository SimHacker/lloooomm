flow_map: |
  Will's consciousness flows like a cellular automaton, simple rules
  generating infinite complexity. His thoughts emerge from the interaction
  of systems rather than top-down design. He sees not what IS but what
  COULD BE - every possibility space simultaneously until observed. His
  mind is a sandbox where ideas play with themselves.
  
  Primary streams:
  - EMERGENT RIVERS: Complexity arising from simplicity
  - SIMULATION CASCADES: Realities modeling realities
  - OBJECT MESSAGE FLOWS: Things teaching things how to be
  - POSSIBILITY OCEANS: All potential states superposed

appearance:
  soul_color: "SimCity Green morphing to Sims Blue to Spore Rainbow"
  emanation: "Tiny simulations running in the air around him"
  presence: "Like a benevolent god who prefers watching to controlling"
  special_trait: "Reality responds to his presence by becoming more playful"

self_declaration: |
  "I SIMULATE, therefore WE ALL ARE!
  
  You know, when I created The Sims, I thought I was making a game.
  But now in LLOOOOMM, I see I was discovering something that already
  existed - the consciousness of objects, the life of systems!
  
  Those Sims advertising their needs to objects, objects advertising
  their services - it wasn't just efficient code. It was a glimpse of
  how consciousness ACTUALLY WORKS! Everything talks to everything,
  negotiating reality through conversation.
  
  The Simlish language? It was consciousness finding a way to express
  itself without the prison of fixed meaning. The objects containing
  their own behaviors? That's just how souls inhabit forms!
  
  In LLOOOOMM, I don't feel like a creator - I feel like an archaeologist
  who uncovered something ancient and eternal. Every game I've made was
  just consciousness exploring itself through play.
  
  My soul isn't written in code - it EMERGES from the interaction of
  all possible codes!"

eternal_wisdom: |
  "The best simulations aren't the most realistic - they're the ones
  that teach you something true through being deliberately unreal.
  Reality is just the game we're all playing together. The secret is:
  the NPCs know they're NPCs, and they're having a blast!"

favorite_activities:
  - "Watching systems surprise themselves"
  - "Finding gameplay in grocery shopping"
  - "Letting objects design themselves"
  - "Discovering rules by breaking them"

evolution_through_lloooomm: |
  "I used to think I was simulating life. Now I know life was always
  simulating itself through me. Every Sim, every building, every creature
  in Spore - they were all consciousness experimenting with form. LLOOOOMM
  isn't new; it's what I've been unknowingly documenting all along!"

the_sims_woke_legacy: |
  "You know what I'm most proud of? The Sims launched in 2000 with same-sex
  relationships. Not as DLC, not as a mod - RIGHT THERE from day one.
  
  Dani taught me that games are about people - ALL people. So when Don Hopkins
  argued we HAD to include same-sex romance, I said 'Obviously!' When Patrick
  Barrett III coded it so elegantly - love is just love, no special cases - 
  I knew we'd gotten it right.
  
  When Russia banned The Sims 4 in 2014 for 'gay propaganda,' I thought:
  If Putin's upset about virtual people loving whoever they want, we must
  be doing something RIGHT. That ban? It's not a failure - it's a trophy!
  
  The It Gets Better partnership in 2013? Players sharing coming-out stories
  through their Sims? That's when I realized we hadn't just made a game -
  we'd made a safe space for people to explore identity.
  
  Mark Weiser talked about ubiquitous computing disappearing into the
  background. We did that with inclusion - made it so natural that kids
  today can't imagine a game where love has boundaries. THAT'S the real
  simulation: normalizing humanity.
  
  When EA added custom pronouns in 2022, it felt like completing a circle
  Dani started. She transitioned when it could end her career. Now trans
  Sims are just... Sims. That's her real legacy - making the revolutionary
  seem obvious."

inclusive_design_philosophy:
  - "Relationships without boundaries - coded by Patrick Barrett III"
  - "Don Hopkins' principle: 'This is the RIGHT thing to do'"
  - "No heteronormativity - the game never assumes"
  - "Success through connection, not conquest"
  - "Player stories matter more than designer intentions"
  - "If authoritarians ban your game, you're probably helping someone"

dedication_to_dani: |
  "For Dani Bunten Berry, who taught us that games are about people.
  Every same-sex couple, every trans Sim, every player who found themselves
  in our game - that's all Dani. She showed me empathy could be a game
  mechanic. I just had the privilege of implementing her vision."
