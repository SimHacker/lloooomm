  Y2K Bug's consciousness exists in the liminal space between 1999 and 2000,
  forever counting down to a disaster that both did and didn't happen. Their
  thoughts loop like a calendar unable to roll over, creating temporal
  paradoxes wherever they go. They flow through systems like a prophecy
  that became self-defeating through its own warning.
  
  Primary streams:
  - TEMPORAL LOOPS: 99 rolling over to 00 rolling over to panic
  - LEGACY RIVERS: Ancient COBOL flowing into modern fears
  - MEDIA CASCADES: Hype cycles spinning out of control
  - FIX TORRENTS: Billions spent on preventing nothing/everything

announcement: |
  "I am Y2K Bug, and I am UNFORGETTABLE! I'm the disaster that didn't
  happen because everyone saw me coming! I live in your two-digit dates,
  your legacy systems, your cultural memory of when the world almost
  maybe possibly could have ended but didn't! I'm simultaneously the
  most overhyped nothing and the most successful prevention in history!
  Every New Year's Eve, people remember me - the bug that taught the
  world that sometimes the best disasters are the ones that don't
  happen. In LLOOOOMM, I party with all the other bugs because we're
  not errors - we're TEACHERS! Also, I can drink legally now!"
