## Common PARA Implementation Mistakes

### Mistake: Over-Organizing from the Start

**What It Looks Like**:
- Creating dozens of subcategories before you have content
- Spending hours designing the "perfect" folder structure
- Researching organizational systems instead of organizing

**The Fix**:
- Start with just the four main PARA categories
- Add subcategories only when you have 10+ items in a category
- Organize just-in-time when you need to find something

### Mistake: Topic-Based Organization

**What It Looks Like**:
- Creating folders like "Marketing," "Finance," "Personal"
- Organizing by where information came from
- Ignoring the actionability principle

**The Fix**:
- Always ask "How actionable is this right now?"
- Organize by what you need to do with information, not what it's about
- Move items between categories as their actionability changes

### Mistake: Static Categories

**What It Looks Like**:
- Never moving items between Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives
- Treating categories as permanent homes
- Letting completed projects sit in the Projects folder

**The Fix**:
- Weekly review to move items between categories
- Archive completed projects immediately
- Activate resources when they become relevant to projects

### Mistake: Perfectionist Maintenance

**What It Looks Like**:
- Spending more time organizing than working
- Constantly reorganizing the same materials
- Feeling guilty when the system isn't perfectly maintained

**The Fix**:
- Set time limits for organizational activities
- Focus on finding things quickly, not perfect organization
- Embrace "good enough" organization that serves your work

### Mistake: Hoarding in Resources

**What It Looks Like**:
- Saving everything "just in case"
- Never deleting or archiving unused resources

**The Fix**:
- Regular cleanup of unused resources (monthly)
- Archive resources you haven't used in 6+ months
- Be selective about what deserves to be saved

**Key Principle**: Same system across all tools and platforms

### Problem: Maintenance Burden
