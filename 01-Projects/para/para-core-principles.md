# PARA Core Principles & Philosophy

*Distilled from Tiago Forte's teachings ü¶ú*

## The PARA Foundation

PARA is fundamentally about **actionability** - organizing information based on how actionable it is right now, not by topic or source.

### The Four Categories (In Order of Actionability)

#### üìã Projects - Highest Actionability
**Definition**: Outcomes you're actively committed to that require multiple work sessions to complete.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Has a specific outcome/goal
- Has a deadline (even if flexible)
- Requires multiple steps/tasks
- Action-oriented and short-term focused
- Once completed, moves to Archives

**Examples**:
- "Launch new website by March"
- "Write quarterly report"
- "Plan vacation to Japan"
- "Potty train the dog"

**Typical Range**: 15-25 active projects is standard for most people

#### üéØ Areas - Ongoing Maintenance
**Definition**: Roles or responsibilities with standards to maintain over time.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Ongoing responsibility
- No specific completion point
- Has standards/quality levels to maintain
- Important now AND in the future
- Less actionable than projects but still requires attention

**Examples**:
- Health & fitness
- Finances
- Professional development
- Relationships
- Home maintenance

**Key Insight**: Areas often generate projects (e.g., "Health" area might generate "Train for 5K" project)

#### üìö Resources - Future Reference
**Definition**: Topics of ongoing interest or useful references for future use.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Low actionability right now
- Waiting to be activated for future projects/areas
- Organized by topic/theme
- "Just in case" information
- May become relevant later

**Examples**:
- Industry research
- Recipes
- Travel destinations
- Learning materials
- Inspiration and ideas

**Philosophy**: Don't over-organize initially - organize when you need to use it

#### üì¶ Archives - Cold Storage
**Definition**: Inactive items from the other three categories.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Almost completely unactionable
- Completed projects
- Outdated areas
- Unused resources
- Searchable but doesn't clutter active workspace

**Examples**:
- Completed project files
- Old job materials
- Past tax records
- Historical documents

**Rule**: When in doubt, archive it - storage is cheap, but mental clutter is expensive

## Core Decision Framework

### The PARA Decision Tree
```
New Information Arrives
‚Üì
Is this actionable right now?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Does it have a deadline?
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí PROJECT üìã
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is it an ongoing responsibility?
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí AREA üéØ
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí RESOURCE üìö
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is it reference material for later?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí RESOURCE üìö
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí ARCHIVE üì¶ (or delete)
```

### Key Questions for Each Category

**For Projects**:
- What is the specific outcome?
- When does this need to be completed?
- What are the next actions required?

**For Areas**:
- What standard am I trying to maintain?
- How often does this need attention?
- What happens if I neglect this?

**For Resources**:
- Might this be useful in the future?
- What topic/theme does this relate to?
- How would I search for this later?

**For Archives**:
- Is this still active/relevant?
- Do I need to keep this for reference?
- What was the original category?

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Actionability Over Topic
- Traditional filing systems organize by topic (Finance, Marketing, etc.)
- PARA organizes by actionability (what needs attention now vs. later)
- This reduces decision fatigue and focuses attention on what matters most

### 2. Progressive Summarization
- Start broad, get specific as needed
- Don't over-organize upfront
- Let the system evolve with your needs

### 3. Just-in-Time Organization
- Organize information when you need to use it
- Avoid perfectionist organizing that never gets used
- "Good enough" is better than perfect

### 4. Mobility and Platform Independence
- PARA works across all apps and platforms
- Same structure in notes, files, email, etc.
- Reduces cognitive load of remembering different systems

### 5. Bias Toward Action
- The goal is to take action, not perfect organization
- If organizing takes more time than the task itself, stop
- Organization serves productivity, not the other way around

## The 10-15 Rule for Projects

### Why Limit Projects?
- More than 15 projects = decision paralysis
- Fewer than 10 = not ambitious enough
- Sweet spot: 10-15 active projects maximum

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Audit Current Projects**: List everything you're working on
2. **Ruthless Prioritization**: Keep only the most important 10-15
3. **Move Excess to "Someday/Maybe"**: Don't delete, just defer
4. **Regular Review**: Weekly check to maintain the limit

### Project States
- **Active**: Working on this week
- **Scheduled**: Has a start date in the future
- **Someday/Maybe**: Might do eventually
- **Waiting For**: Blocked by someone else

## Common Mistakes & Solutions

### Mistake 1: Over-Categorizing
**Problem**: Creating too many subcategories initially
**Solution**: Start with the four main categories, subdivide only when necessary

### Mistake 2: Topic-Based Thinking
**Problem**: Organizing by subject instead of actionability
**Solution**: Always ask "How actionable is this right now?"

### Mistake 3: Perfectionism
**Problem**: Spending more time organizing than working
**Solution**: Set time limits for organizing activities

### Mistake 4: Static Categories
**Problem**: Never moving items between categories
**Solution**: Regular reviews and migrations (weekly/monthly)

### Mistake 5: Hoarding in Resources
**Problem**: Resources becoming a dumping ground
**Solution**: Regular cleanup and archiving of unused items

## Integration with Other Systems

### Getting Things Done (GTD) Compatibility
- PARA handles reference materials (GTD's weakness)
- GTD handles next actions (PARA's focus is higher level)
- Use together: GTD for tasks, PARA for information

### Second Brain Integration
- PARA provides the organizational structure
- CODE method (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express) provides the workflow
- Together they create a complete knowledge management system

### Digital Tools Integration
- **Notes Apps**: Primary home for PARA structure
- **File Storage**: Mirrors PARA for documents/media
- **Task Managers**: Projects break down into tasks
- **Calendar**: Time-specific commitments from projects/areas

## Success Metrics

### You'll Know PARA is Working When:
- ‚úÖ You can find anything in under 2 minutes
- ‚úÖ You feel confident about what you're working on
- ‚úÖ You're not constantly reorganizing
- ‚úÖ New information has an obvious home
- ‚úÖ You actually use your organizational system

### Red Flags That Need Attention:
- ‚ùå Spending more time organizing than working
- ‚ùå Creating folders you never use
- ‚ùå Constantly searching for things
- ‚ùå Avoiding your organizational system
- ‚ùå Feeling overwhelmed by your own structure

## The Philosophy Behind PARA

### From Scarcity to Abundance
We've moved from information scarcity to information abundance. Our psychology hasn't adapted - we still try to hoard and save everything. PARA helps us be selective and intentional about what deserves our attention.

### Perspective as the Ultimate Resource
In our information-rich world, the scarcest resource isn't attention - it's **perspective**. PARA helps you develop a point of view by organizing information in service of your goals and projects.

### The Action-Reference Framework
Think of your information system as having two hemispheres:
- **Left Brain (Action)**: Tasks, projects, things to do
- **Right Brain (Reference)**: Ideas, inspiration, things to think about

PARA bridges both hemispheres by organizing reference material in service of actionable outcomes.
