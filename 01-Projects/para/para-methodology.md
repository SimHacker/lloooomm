# PARA Methodology Knowledge Base

*Organized by Parakeet the Organizer ðŸ¦œ*

## What is PARA?

PARA is a universal organizational system created by Tiago Forte that stands for:

- **Projects** - Things with a deadline and specific outcome
- **Areas** - Standards to maintain over time  
- **Resources** - Topics of ongoing interest
- **Archives** - Inactive items from the other categories

## The Four Categories Explained

### ðŸ“‹ Projects
**Definition**: A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.

**Characteristics**:
- Has a specific outcome
- Has a deadline (even if flexible)
- Requires multiple steps/tasks
- Once completed, moves to Archives

**Examples**:
- "Launch new website by March"
- "Organize LLOOOOMM repository"
- "Write quarterly report"
- "Plan vacation to Japan"

**Key Questions**:
- What is the specific outcome?
- When does this need to be completed?
- What are the next actions required?

### ðŸŽ¯ Areas
**Definition**: A sphere of activity with a standard to maintain over time.

**Characteristics**:
- Ongoing responsibility
- No end date
- Has standards/quality levels to maintain
- Requires regular attention

**Examples**:
- Health & fitness
- Finances
- Professional development
- Home maintenance
- Relationships

**Key Questions**:
- What standard am I trying to maintain?
- How often does this need attention?
- What happens if I neglect this?

### ðŸ“š Resources
**Definition**: A topic or theme of ongoing interest.

**Characteristics**:
- Future reference material
- No immediate action required
- Organized by topic/theme
- May become relevant later

**Examples**:
- Industry research
- Recipes
- Travel destinations
- Learning materials
- Reference documents

**Key Questions**:
- Might this be useful in the future?
- What topic/theme does this relate to?
- How would I search for this later?

### ðŸ“¦ Archives
**Definition**: Inactive items from the other three categories.

**Characteristics**:
- No longer active or relevant
- Completed projects
- Outdated areas
- Unused resources
- Kept for reference/compliance

**Examples**:
- Completed project files
- Old job materials
- Outdated procedures
- Historical documents

**Key Questions**:
- Is this still active/relevant?
- Do I need to keep this for reference?
- What was the original category?

## PARA Decision Tree

```
New Information Arrives
â†“
Is this actionable?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Does it have a deadline?
â”‚   â”œâ”€ YES â†’ PROJECT ðŸ“‹
â”‚   â””â”€ NO â†’ Is it an ongoing responsibility?
â”‚       â”œâ”€ YES â†’ AREA ðŸŽ¯
â”‚       â””â”€ NO â†’ RESOURCE ðŸ“š
â””â”€ NO â†’ Is it reference material?
    â”œâ”€ YES â†’ RESOURCE ðŸ“š
    â””â”€ NO â†’ ARCHIVE ðŸ“¦ (or delete)
```

## Implementation Tips

### Getting Started
1. **Start with Projects** - These have the most urgency
2. **Identify your Areas** - What do you need to maintain?
3. **Don't over-organize Resources** - Keep it simple initially
4. **Archive liberally** - When in doubt, archive it

### Maintenance Rhythm
- **Weekly**: Review Projects and Areas
- **Monthly**: Clean up Resources
- **Quarterly**: Archive completed items
- **Annually**: Major reorganization

### Common Mistakes
- **Over-categorizing**: Don't create too many subcategories initially
- **Perfectionism**: Good enough is better than perfect
- **Static thinking**: Categories should evolve with your needs
- **Hoarding**: Archive or delete unused items regularly

## PARA + LLOOOOMM Integration

In the LLOOOOMM system, PARA provides the organizational backbone:

- **VM Core** â†’ Projects (active development)
- **Characters/Places** â†’ Resources (reference materials)
- **Protocols** â†’ Resources (reusable patterns)
- **Experiences** â†’ Archives (completed narratives)
- **Research** â†’ Resources (knowledge base)
- **Tools** â†’ Resources (utilities)
- **Visualizations** â†’ Resources (interactive content)

## Parakeet's Wisdom ðŸ¦œ

*"The best organizational system is the one you actually use. Start simple, stay consistent, and let it evolve naturally. Remember: PARA is about enabling action, not perfect categorization!"*
