# LLOOOOMM Disclaimer Survey Plan
# Location: /02-Areas/maintenance/disclaimer-survey.yml
# Purpose: Stream through all HTML files and classify by disclaimer state
# Date: June 29, 2025
# Cross-Reference: BRANDING Protocol Implementation

survey_metadata:
  total_files: 251
  directory: "/Users/a2deh/GroundUp/Leela/git/lloooomm/dist"
  last_updated: "2025-06-29"
  survey_status: "active"
  methodology: "stream through files using huge context window for batch processing"
  html_standardization: "complete - all files have DOCTYPE + filename comments + proper formatting"
  files_analyzed: "a* (14) + b* (8) = 22/251 total"

# METHODOLOGY FOR REPRODUCIBLE BATCH PROCESSING
methodology:
  file_listing:
    command: "ls -l {letter}*.html"
    purpose: "Get complete list of files to analyze for verification"
    
  batch_reading:
    command: "cat {letter}*.html"
    purpose: "Read ALL files of given letter into huge context window simultaneously"
    advantage: "Enables pattern recognition across similar file types"
    
  verification_protocol:
    step_1: "Compare files analyzed vs directory listing"
    step_2: "Report any missed files for additional analysis"
    step_3: "Update survey with comprehensive results"
    step_4: "Move to next letter alphabetically"
    
  file_comparison_template: |

  batch_process_template: |
    1. List files: ls -l {letter}*.html
    2. Read all files: cat {letter}*.html  
    3. Analyze in huge context window
    4. Classify each file by disclaimer status
    5. Compare analyzed vs listed files
    6. Update survey with results
    7. Move to next letter
    
  classification_focus:
    - "Look for EXACTLY ONE top disclaimer"
    - "Look for EXACTLY ONE bottom disclaimer"
    - "Verify working anchor links"
    - "Check character attribution quality"
    - "Identify content type patterns"
    
  efficiency_tips:
    - "Use huge context window for pattern recognition"
    - "Group similar files (series, content types)"
    - "Always verify file count against directory listing"
    - "Document unique patterns for template creation"

# Strategic lessons learned:
strategic_breakthroughs:
  multi_letter_efficiency: "Combining small letter batches (J=4, K=3) with larger ones (I=9) maximizes context window usage"
  pattern_template_recognition: "Character celebration series, real person simulations, technical content each have predictable disclaimer patterns"
  file_size_awareness: "Always check directory listing for massive files before batch processing"
  loop_prevention: "Strategic analysis prevents infinite loops and improves quality"
  adaptive_batch_sizing: "Adjust batch size based on file sizes and content complexity"

# Next strategic target: L* files (39 files - major batch like Hunter!)
next_batch: "l"
estimated_l_files: 39  # Needs Hunter-level strategic approach
remaining_files: 175   # 251 - 76 = 175 files to analyze - CORRECTED MATH
