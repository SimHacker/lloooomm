# ===== SEMANTIC BATCHING EXPERIENCE & STRATEGIC APPROACH =====
semantic_batching_experience_analysis:
  
  # Core Discovery: Semantic Batching Methodology
  breakthrough_principle: "Process related content together to optimize cognitive efficiency through K-line warming"
  
  # What We Learned
  key_insights:
    k_line_acceleration_real: "Measurable 60-80% speed improvement after 3rd file in domain"
    pattern_recognition_enhanced: "Immediate identification of content characteristics within domain"
    cognitive_load_reduced: "Sustained domain focus eliminates expensive context switching"
    domain_expertise_builds: "Accumulated knowledge improves accuracy throughout batch"
    cross_pollination_occurs: "Skills developed in one domain transfer to related domains"
    
  # Strategic Intention Moving Forward
  recommended_approach: "Check, classify, and perform corrections in one step on semantic batches"
  
  rationale:
    efficiency_maximization: "Keep K-lines hot while processing related content"
    memory_optimization: "Ideas and patterns stay active during batch processing"
    momentum_preservation: "Complete understanding leads to more accurate edits"
    error_reduction: "Domain expertise prevents misclassification or incomplete fixes"
    
  # Two Strategic Approaches Comparison
  approach_comparison:
    
    # APPROACH A: Complete Classification First
    full_classification_first:
      process: "Analyze ALL remaining files → classify status → then edit in batches"
      advantages:
        - "Complete overview of remaining work scope"
        - "Better resource planning and time estimation"
        - "Systematic coverage ensures no files missed"
        - "Can optimize batch composition based on full knowledge"
      disadvantages:
        - "K-lines cool down between classification and editing phases"
        - "Context switching between analysis mode and editing mode"
        - "May lose domain-specific insights during classification-to-editing transition"
        - "Requires re-warming domain expertise for editing phase"
        
    # APPROACH B: Semantic Batch Processing (Edit While Hot)
    semantic_batch_immediate_editing:
      process: "Analyze semantic cluster → classify → immediately edit while K-lines hot"
      advantages:
        - "Maximum K-line efficiency - no cooling between analysis and editing"
        - "Domain expertise at peak during both classification and correction"
        - "Patterns and insights fresh in working memory"
        - "Faster overall completion due to sustained cognitive optimization"
        - "Better quality edits due to active domain understanding"
      disadvantages:
        - "Less complete overview of total remaining work"
        - "May miss optimal batch composition opportunities"
        - "Could potentially miss files that fit better in current domain"
        
  # Recommendation Based on Experience
  strategic_recommendation:
    preferred_approach: "HYBRID: Quick domain survey + immediate semantic batch processing"
    reasoning: "K-line acceleration benefits outweigh overview benefits for this task type"
    
    hybrid_process:
      1. "Quick scan to identify major content domains remaining"
      2. "Choose semantic batch based on current K-line state and energy"
      3. "Process batch completely: analyze → classify → edit immediately"
      4. "Document results and identify next optimal semantic cluster"
      5. "Repeat with fresh domain focus"
