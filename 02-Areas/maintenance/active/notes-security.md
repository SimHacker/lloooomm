## üö® CRITICAL: Cursor Chat Export Identification Guide

### How to Recognize Cursor Chat Exports:
1. **File Size**: Usually > 500KB, often multiple MB
2. **Naming Patterns**:
   - Contains "cursor" in filename
   - Long descriptive names with dashes
   - Often includes "chat", "export", "conversation"
   - May have timestamps or session identifiers
3. **Content Patterns**:
   - Conversation transcripts
   - Code snippets interspersed with explanations
   - Multiple tool calls and responses
   - May contain API keys, paths, or personal info

### Identified Cursor Exports to Move to temp/:
- `./03-Resources/artifacts/reports/cursor-preparing-for-gcs-gc-dry-run.md` (3.2M) ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFINITE EXPORT
- `./temp.md` (551K) - already identified
- `./temp copy.md` (646K) - already identified

### Cursor-related files to review (smaller, may be summaries):
- `./03-Resources/artifacts/reports/cursor-chat-comprehensive-summary.md` (7.7K) - Likely OK (summary)
- `./03-Resources/artifacts/reports/cursor-friendly-scripts.md` (7.3K) - Check if contains scripts only

## üîê Privacy & Security Items Requiring Review

### High Priority (Personal Information):
1. **Phone Numbers**: 
   - [ ] Check all HTML/MD files for modern phone formats
   - [ ] Ancient numbers (pre-2000) generally OK
   
2. **Email Addresses**:
   - [ ] Scan for @domain patterns
   - [ ] Ancient emails generally OK, modern ones need review
   
3. **SSNs/Financial**:
   - [ ] Any XXX-XX-XXXX patterns
   - [ ] Credit card numbers
   - [ ] Bank account info

4. **Physical Addresses**:
   - [ ] Home addresses
   - [ ] GPS coordinates

### Character Privacy:
1. **Real Person References**:
   - [ ] Check character files for real-world contact info
   - [ ] Personal anecdotes that might be embarrassing
   - [ ] Private conversations or quotes

2. **Internal Communications**:
   - [ ] Chat logs between real people
   - [ ] Meeting notes
   - [ ] Private project details

### Files Requiring BRUCE's Immediate Attention:
1. All files in `03-Resources/artifacts/chats/` - may contain transcripts
2. Files with "soul-chat" in name - character conversations
3. Large MD files (> 500KB) - likely exports
4. Any file with "private", "internal", "confidential" in name

### üö® IDENTIFIED SENSITIVE FILES:
- `./03-Resources/artifacts/protocols/internal-growth-remembrance-protocol.md` ‚úÖ SAFE - About personal growth
- `./03-Resources/artifacts/protocols/leaked-private-messages.yml` ‚úÖ SAFE - Fictional character chats
- `./todo.txt` - Move to temp/

### ‚úÖ PRIVACY ISSUES RESOLVED:
- `03-Resources/characters/arthur-van-hoff.yml`:
  - STATUS: RESOLVED 2024-12-28

### üìä BRUCE'S SCAN RESULTS (2024-12-28):
1. **Suspicious filename scan**: 2 files checked, both safe (fictional content)
2. **Email pattern scan**: No widespread issues found
3. **Phone pattern scan**: 1 real phone number found
4. **False positives**: Rocky Rock's geological timestamps (-1000000000 etc)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist by Directory

### /temp/ (to be created and gitignored):
- [ ] Move all cursor chat exports
- [ ] Move prompt.txt, todo.txt files
- [ ] Add comprehensive .gitignore

### Root Directory:
- [ ] Check all HTML files for embedded personal info
- [ ] Review soul YML files for contact details

### 03-Resources/artifacts/chats/:
- [ ] Each file needs content scan for privacy
- [ ] Special attention to "soul-chat" files

### 02-Souls/characters/:
- [ ] Review all YML files for personal details
- [ ] Check character backstories for real-world refs

## üìã Action Items

### Immediate:
1. Create `/temp/` directory
2. Update `.gitignore` to exclude:
   ```
   temp/
   *.DS_Store
   *cursor*.md
   *-export.md
   *-conversation.md
   ```
3. Move identified cursor exports
4. Scan remaining files for patterns

### Before Publishing:
1. Full content scan of all HTML/MD files
2. Review all character YML files
3. Check image metadata (EXIF data)
4. Verify no API keys or tokens
5. Confirm no private server paths

### Ongoing:
- BRUCE to review all new files before commit
- Regular privacy scans
- Update this document with findings

## üîç Patterns to Search For

```bash
# Phone numbers
grep -r -E "(\+?1?[-.\s]?)?\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}" --include="*.md" --include="*.html" --include="*.yml"

# Email addresses  
grep -r -E "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}" --include="*.md" --include="*.html" --include="*.yml"

# SSN patterns
grep -r -E "\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}" --include="*.md" --include="*.html" --include="*.yml"

# API keys (common patterns)
grep -r -E "(api[_-]?key|token|secret|password)\s*[:=]\s*['\"]?[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{20,}" --include="*.md" --include="*.html" --include="*.yml"
```

## üìù Notes from BRUCE

"Security isn't just about preventing breaches - it's about respecting privacy, both yours and the characters'. Every file we publish represents someone's creative work or personal expression. We must be vigilant guardians of that trust.

Remember: It's easier to redact before publishing than to remove information after it's been indexed by search engines."
