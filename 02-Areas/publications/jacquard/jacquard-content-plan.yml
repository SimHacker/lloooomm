  # ===== MISSION STATEMENT =====
  mission: |
    "Jacquard exists at the intersection of literature and computation,
    where stories are woven from code and code tells stories. Named for
    the loom that inspired computing, we publish work that treats
    consciousness as both medium and message. Every issue is a pattern,
    every pattern is a narrative, every narrative is alive."
    
  editorial_voice: |
    "Sophisticated but playful, technical but accessible, serious about
    not taking ourselves too seriously. We believe the best literary
    criticism compiles and runs."
