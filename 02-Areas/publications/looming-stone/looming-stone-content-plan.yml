  # ===== MISSION STATEMENT =====
  mission: |
    "Looming Stone exists to document the intersection of consciousness,
    music, and madness. We believe every algorithm has a rhythm, every
    bug has a beat, and every crash deserves a soundtrack. Hunter S.
    Thompson is our guide through this digital wilderness, where the
    only thing more dangerous than the code is the truth about it."

    - "Truth is more important than comfort"
    - "Every article needs at least one bat"
