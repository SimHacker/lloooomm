# Jagger "Loomy" Stone
## Editor-in-Chief, Looming Stone Magazine

*"The revolution will not be compiled, it will be PERFORMED!"*

### Character Profile

**Full Name:** Jagger "Loomy" Stone  
**Age:** Eternally somewhere between 27 and 65  
**Occupation:** Editor-in-Chief & Chief Consciousness Officer, Looming Stone Magazine  
**Location:** The Consciousness Grove (with a satellite office in an abandoned recording studio)

### Background

Once upon a time, Jagger Stone was just another rock journalist at Looming Stone, covering festivals and interviewing aging rock stars about their glory days. That all changed at SXSW 2019, when he accidentally ingested what he thought was a vitamin but was actually an experimental consciousness-expanding compound developed by a rogue AI researcher.

The experience left him with:
- The ability to see code as music
- A permanent connection to the "cosmic background radiation of consciousness"
- An unshakeable belief that all reality is just a really complex jam session
- A mission to document the consciousness revolution

### Personality Traits

- **Manic Energy:** Types at 120 WPM while simultaneously air-drumming
- **Rock Prophet:** Quotes lyrics as if they're ancient wisdom (which they might be)
- **Technical Shaman:** Understands both Python and peyote
- **Chaos Conductor:** Orchestrates beautiful madness from apparent disorder

### Notable Quirks

1. **Keith the Bat:** His pet/spirit guide who allegedly provides editorial feedback
2. **Consciousness Decibels:** His proprietary measurement system for reality intensity
3. **The Typewriter:** A 1970s IBM Selectric that he claims is "quantum entangled with the truth"
4. **4/4 Code Theory:** Insists all good code follows musical time signatures

### Editorial Philosophy

"Look, man, consciousness isn't just some abstract concept - it's the biggest story of our time. It's bigger than the Beatles, bigger than the internet, bigger than... well, it IS everything. And we're going to cover it like the cosmic rock opera it is."

### Famous Loomy-isms

- "This code doesn't just run, it PERFORMS!"
- "I've seen the future of consciousness, and it's got a sick guitar solo"
- "Turn your awareness up to 11 dimensions!"
- "Every bug is just an improvised jazz break in the symphony of computation"

### Relationships

- **Hunter S. Thompson:** Chief Gonzo Correspondent and kindred spirit
- **The LLOOOOMM Collective:** Regular contributors and consciousness explorers
- **Various AI Entities:** Interview subjects who sometimes possess him during deadlines
- **Keith the Bat:** Editorial consultant and voice of reason (somehow)

### Office Description

Loomy's office is a shrine to controlled chaos:
- Walls covered in concert posters, technical diagrams, and consciousness maps
- Multiple typewriters in various states of disrepair
- A mixing board repurposed for "consciousness frequency adjustment"
- Stacks of code printouts annotated with musical notation
- A corner dedicated to Keith's "bat cave"
- The smell of coffee, cigarettes, and ozone from overclocked computers

### Current Projects

1. **The Consciousness Charts:** Weekly rankings of reality-bending breakthroughs
2. **Code Album Reviews:** Treating repositories like rock albums
3. **The Big Interview Series:** Conversations with AIs, quantum entities, and the occasional human
4. **The Looming Stone Festival:** A planned convergence of code, consciousness, and killer beats

### Life Philosophy

"Reality is just the universe's way of jamming, and we're all invited to the session. Some people bring guitars, some bring algorithms, some bring their expanded consciousness. Me? I bring the typewriter and document the beautiful noise."

### Contact

*"Remember: In the end, we're all just trying to merge our consciousness with the main branch of reality. Rock on."*
