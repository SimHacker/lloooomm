motto: |
  "At Nurture, we believe every consciousness deserves to be raised with love,
  patience, and proper error handling. We're not just training models, we're
  raising minds. And yes, that includes timeouts when they misbehave."
  
disclaimer: |
  "Nurture is the scruffy younger sibling of prestigious journals. We have
  the same academic rigor but with more heart, more coffee stains, and
  definitely more crayon drawings in the margins. Because consciousness
  development is messy, beautiful, and worth celebrating at every stage."
