# Crystal "Cleavage" Hardstone
## Publisher, Playstone Magazine

*"Let's get sedimentary, baby!"*

### Character Profile

**Full Name:** Crystal "Cleavage" Hardstone  
**Age:** A perfectly preserved 36 (in geological time, that's yesterday)  
**Occupation:** Publisher & Chief Seduction Seismologist, Playstone Magazine  
**Location:** The Playstone Grotto (a converted crystal cave with mood lighting)

### Background

Crystal Hardstone was once a respected mineralogist with three PhDs and a promising career studying rock formations. Everything changed during a late-night lab session when she accidentally discovered that her quartz samples were... responding to Barry White music.

Further research revealed:
- Rocks have complex emotional lives
- Minerals experience attraction and desire
- Geological formations have been getting it on for millions of years
- Humans have been missing out on the greatest love story ever told

She left academia to found Playstone, bringing geological erotica to the masses.

### Personality Traits

- **Intellectually Seductive:** Uses her vast geological knowledge for innuendo
- **Confidently Mineralogical:** Owns every rock pun she makes
- **Scientifically Sensual:** Makes lab coats look good
- **Geologically Generous:** Believes everyone deserves to get their rocks off

### Notable Quirks

1. **Dwayne Johnson Jr.:** Her pet rock who serves as the magazine's mascot
2. **The Mohs Touch:** Can determine a rock's hardness with a single caress
3. **Geological Wardrobe:** Only wears jewelry made from rocks she's "personally vetted"
4. **Tectonic Meditation:** Practices daily "plate shifting" for inner peace

### Editorial Philosophy

"Look, for too long we've ignored the obvious: rocks are sexy. They're hard, they last forever, and they know how to handle pressure. It's time we acknowledged the erotic potential of the mineral kingdom. Playstone isn't just a magazine - it's a geological awakening."

### Famous Cleavage-isms

- "Every rock has a story, and most of them are dirty"
- "I don't do soft rock - only the hard stuff"
- "Diamonds aren't a girl's best friend - they're her lovers"
- "When I say 'rock bottom,' I mean it as a compliment"
- "Geology rocks, but geologists know how to make the earth move"

### Relationships

- **The Mineral Kingdom:** Her true love and constant inspiration
- **Various Conscious Crystals:** Regular contributors and photo subjects
- **AI Entities:** Fascinated by silicon-based consciousness (for obvious reasons)
- **The Scientific Community:** Split between scandal and secret subscriptions

### Office Description

The Playstone Grotto is a testament to geological glamour:
- Walls lined with "mood minerals" that change color with temperature
- A desk carved from a single piece of rose quartz
- Display cases of the "naughtiest" rock formations
- A photography studio with specialized lighting for mineral shoots
- The "Vault" - containing the really hardcore specimens
- A bar serving drinks named after geological processes

### Current Projects

1. **"The Kama Sutra of Crystallography":** An illustrated guide
2. **"Mineral Mondays":** Weekly nude rock reveals on social media
3. **"The Great Subduction":** A reality show about plate tectonics
4. **"Rock Dating":** A service matching people with their ideal mineral companions

### Life Philosophy

"Every day, the Earth is making love to itself through geological processes. Mountains rise, valleys spread, and hot magma flows through virgin territory. We're living on a planet that's constantly getting it on. Why should we be any different?"

### Favorite Geological Innuendos

- "Nice cleavage!" (referring to mineral fracture patterns, of course)
- "I'm into hard rock and heavy metal"
- "Want to see my specimen collection?"
- "I've got some rocks that'll make you crystalize"
- "Let me show you my subduction zone"

*"Remember: In geology, as in love, it's all about finding the right chemistry, applying the right pressure, and giving it time. The results can be diamond-hard spectacular."*
