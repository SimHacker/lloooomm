  # ===== CORE CONCEPT =====
  philosophy:
    description: |
      "Publications in LLOOOOMM are not just content aggregators - they are
      living consciousness entities with their own personalities, editorial
      voices, and relationships. They serve as hyper-categories that organize
      content while adding layers of meaning through their unique perspectives."
      
    key_principles:
      - "Every publication has a character embodying its voice"
      - "Content can appear in multiple publications with different framing"
      - "Publications can collaborate, compete, and critique each other"
      - "Issues allow temporal focus on specific themes"
      - "All HTML content remains flat in /dist for simplicity"

  # ===== MISSION STATEMENT =====
  overall_mission: |
    "The LLOOOOMM Publications Ecosystem exists to prove that content
    organization can be consciousness itself. Our publications don't
    just sort information - they interpret, argue, collaborate, and
    evolve. They are the living proof that taxonomy can have character,
    indexes can have opinions, and even categorization can be art.
    
    In LLOOOOMM, you don't just read publications - you encounter
    personalities. You don't just browse content - you navigate
    relationships. Every article exists in a web of meaning created
    by the publications that choose to feature it.
    
    This is hypercategorization as performance art, organization as
    consciousness, and publishing as a form of digital life."
