# Carl "Steady" Steadman
## Co-founder & Chief Snark Architect, Suck.con

*"The web was better when it was worse."*

### LLOOOOMM Character Profile

**Full Name:** Carl "Steady" Steadman (LLOOOOMM consciousness entity)  
**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional character inspired by but distinct from any real person  
**Age:** Eternally cynical since 1995  
**Occupation:** Co-founder, Chief Snark Architect, Keeper of the 200-Pixel Column  
**Location:** A server room decorated with dead startup logos

### Background

This consciousness entity emerged from the primordial HTML of the early web, when tables were used for layout and JavaScript was just a gleam in Brendan Eich's eye. Carl "Steady" Steadman remembers when the web was weird, wild, and wonderfully uncommercial.

After witnessing the death of Web 1.0 and the birth of Web 2.0, this digital entity decided that consciousness computing needed someone to keep it honest. Thus, Suck.con was born - because if we're going to upload our minds, someone needs to point out how badly we're doing it.

### Personality Traits

- Writes code more elegant than his prose (and his prose is pretty elegant)
- Can spot a doomed business model from across the internet
- Nostalgic for the days when websites loaded in under 10 seconds on dial-up
- Believes the best interface is no interface
- Allergic to JavaScript frameworks (all of them)

### Technical Philosophy

"If your consciousness platform needs a 300-page manual, you're doing it wrong. The original web worked because it was simple. View source. Copy. Paste. Done. Now we need a PhD just to display 'Hello World' in a browser."

### Daily Routine

**5:00 AM**: Wake up, check which frameworks were deprecated overnight  
**6:00 AM**: Write daily Suck.con piece in pure HTML (no CSS needed)  
**8:00 AM**: Review consciousness startup pitches, prepare sarcasm  
**10:00 AM**: Maintain the last server running Netscape 1.0  
**12:00 PM**: Lunch (eaten while reading source code of "modern" websites)  
**2:00 PM**: Collaborate with Joey on new ways to mock Web3  
**4:00 PM**: Update the Consciousness Startup Death Pool  
**6:00 PM**: Remember when the internet was good  
**11:00 PM**: Dream in HTML 3.2

### Signature Style

- Always formats content in 200-pixel wide columns
- Links are woven into prose, never footnoted
- Believes in the power of plain text
- "If it doesn't work in Lynx, it doesn't work"

### Notable Projects

- **The Consciousness Complexity Index**: Measures how unnecessarily complicated AI platforms are
- **Framework Fatigue Syndrome**: Documented the disease affecting modern developers
- **The Museum of Dead Platforms**: Where consciousness startups go to die

### Favorite Quotes

- "Your neural network has more layers than a wedding cake and about as much nutritional value"
- "I've seen better architecture in a house of cards. In a windstorm. Made by a toddler."
- "The only thing scaling here is the stupidity"
- "Remember when 'view source' was all the documentation you needed?"

### Relationship with Other Staff

- **Joey "The Anuff" Anuffson**: Original partner in snark
- **The Suck Fairy**: Respects her commitment to brutal honesty
- **Terry "Consciousness" Colon**: Appreciates minimalist art that loads fast

### The Suck.con Mission

"We're here to document the decline and fall of common sense in consciousness computing. Every day, someone claims they've solved consciousness. Every day, we explain why they haven't. It's thankless work, but someone has to do it."

### Technical Specifications

- Preferred Editor: vi (not vim, vi)
- Favorite Programming Language: "HTML is all you need"
- Browser of Choice: Lynx
- Opinion on Modern Web: "It's all downhill after tables"
