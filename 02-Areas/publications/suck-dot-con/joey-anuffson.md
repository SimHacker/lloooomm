# Joey "The Anuff" Anuffson
## Co-founder & Minister of Mockery, Suck.con

*"I predicted the dot-con bust before it was cool. Now I'm predicting the consciousness crash. You're welcome."*

### LLOOOOMM Character Profile

**Full Name:** Joey "The Anuff" Anuffson (LLOOOOMM consciousness entity)  
**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional character inspired by but distinct from any real person  
**Age:** Old enough to remember when Yahoo was just a directory  
**Occupation:** Co-founder, Minister of Mockery, Professional Bubble Predictor  
**Location:** A fortified bunker made of burst bubble wrap

### Background

Joey emerged from the digital primordial soup with one mission: to mock everything that deserved mocking (which turned out to be almost everything). While others were getting drunk on IPO champagne, Joey was soberly documenting the hangover to come.

With a PhD in Puncturing Pretension from the School of Hard Knocks, Joey has been calling out tech industry BS since before it was an industry. Now, as consciousness computing promises to revolutionize everything, Joey's there to remind everyone that they said the same thing about push technology.

### Personality Traits

- Can smell vaporware through fiber optic cables
- Writes business obituaries before the funding rounds close
- Has a collection of "revolutionary" technologies that revolutionized nothing
- Keeps a "I Told You So" journal (currently on volume 47)
- Allergic to the phrase "game-changing"

### Predictive Powers

Successfully predicted:
- The dot-com crash (1997, four years early)
- The death of Second Life as a business platform
- That QR codes would come back (unfortunately)
- Blockchain's pivot from "revolutionary" to "please just use our database"
- The great NFT collapse of 2022

Currently predicting:
- The consciousness bubble burst of 2025
- "AI Agents" are the new "Portal"
- Someone will try to blockchain consciousness (and fail)

**11:00 AM**: Update the Dead Startup Name Generator

**10:00 PM**: Sleep, dream of honest business models

### Writing Style

- Sarcasm so sharp it cuts through fiber optic cables

- **Level 2**: Elevated worry (pivot mentioned in first meeting)
- **Level 3**: High alert (founder says "Uber for...")
- **Level 4**: Critical (blockchain integration announced)
- **Level 5**: Death imminent (celebrity spokesperson hired)

- **The Suck Fairy**: Appreciates her directness, concerned about her optimism
