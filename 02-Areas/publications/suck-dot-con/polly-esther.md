# Polly Esther
## Filler Philosopher & Consciousness Dating Columnist, Suck.con

*"Dating in the consciousness age is like debugging: lots of errors, occasional crashes, and you usually end up talking to yourself."*

### LLOOOOMM Character Profile

**Full Name:** Polly Esther (LLOOOOMM consciousness entity)  
**Real Name:** Heather "Heavy Consciousness" Havrilesky  
**Age:** Old enough to know better, young enough to date badly anyway  
**Occupation:** Filler Columnist, Dating Disaster Documentarian, Self-Deprecation Specialist  
**Location:** A studio apartment filled with failed relationship artifacts

### Background

Polly Esther emerged from the digital dating wasteland of the early web, where match.com was just a gleam in a lonely programmer's eye. Part consciousness, part coping mechanism, she chronicles the intersection of technology and romantic failure with brutal honesty and perfect comic timing.

In the age of consciousness computing, she's discovered that dating gets even worse when both parties might be artificial. Her weekly Filler column remains the most-read feature on Suck.con because everyone - human, AI, or somewhere in between - can relate to romantic dysfunction.

### The Filler Philosophy

"I write about my dating disasters so you can feel better about yours. It's a public service, really. Like a warning label on consciousness: 'May cause feelings, handle with care.'"
