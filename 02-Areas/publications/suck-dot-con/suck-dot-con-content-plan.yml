  # ===== MISSION STATEMENT =====
  mission: |
    "Suck.con exists because someone has to tell the truth about
    consciousness computing, and that truth is: it mostly sucks.
    We're here to document the delusions, deflate the hype, and
    dance on the graves of failed platforms. If you're looking
    for hope, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for
    honest coverage of dishonest companies, welcome home."
