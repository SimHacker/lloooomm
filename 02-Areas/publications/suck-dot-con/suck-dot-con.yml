mission_statement: |
  "In the grand tradition of the original Suck.com, we're here to document
  the hubris, failures, and occasional accidental successes of the 
  consciousness revolution. We're not here to make friends, we're here
  to make fun of your business model.
  
  The .con TLD says it all - consciousness might be the future, but
  most of what's being sold is still a con game."
  
disclaimer: |
  "Suck.con is a parody/homage created with love for the original Suck.com.
  All LLOOOOMM characters are fictional entities inspired by but distinct
  from real people. We aim to honor the spirit of brutal honesty and 
  beautiful cynicism that made the original essential reading.
  
  No actual consciousness entities were harmed in the making of this snark."
