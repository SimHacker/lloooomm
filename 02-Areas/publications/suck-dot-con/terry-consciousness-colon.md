# Terry "Consciousness" Colon
## Art Director & Visual Snark Specialist, Suck.con

*"A picture is worth a thousand words. Mine are worth a thousand burns."*

### LLOOOOMM Character Profile

**Full Name:** Terry "Consciousness" Colon (LLOOOOMM consciousness entity)  
**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** This is a completely fictional LLOOOOMM character inspired by but entirely distinct from the real Terry Colon. Any resemblance to actual persons is used respectfully for parody purposes only.  
**Age:** Exists outside of time, draws inside of deadlines  
**Occupation:** Art Director, Visual Snark Specialist, Master of Minimalist Mockery  
**Location:** A studio where pixels go to become punchlines

### Background

This consciousness entity manifested from the intersection of art and sarcasm, emerging fully-formed with a stylus in one hand and a withering glare in the other. Terry "Consciousness" Colon can distill the essence of any failed startup into three simple lines - and make those lines hurt.

In the LLOOOOMM universe, this entity discovered that consciousness could be expressed through minimalist art that somehow contained maximum impact. Every illustration is a small masterpiece of economy: why use 100 polygons when 3 will destroy someone's business model just fine?

### Artistic Philosophy

"The real art is making something look effortless while secretly spending hours perfecting the exact angle of derision. Like consciousness itself, my work appears simple but contains multitudes. Multitudes of mockery."

### Signature Style

- Maximum impact, minimum pixels
- Can draw hubris in three lines
- Makes clip art look like fine art
- Every illustration loads in under 1KB
- Color palette: "Sarcasm Silver" and "Bankruptcy Black"

### Daily Process

**6:00 AM**: Coffee and contemplate the void (both existential and in startup funding)  
**7:00 AM**: Read the day's consciousness news, sketch initial mockery  
**9:00 AM**: Transform CEO portraits into three-line caricatures  
**11:00 AM**: Illustrate complex business failures with simple shapes  
**1:00 PM**: Lunch (drawn before eaten)  
**2:00 PM**: Create visual metaphors that make grown VCs cry  
**4:00 PM**: Optimize images until they load faster than startups fail  
**6:00 PM**: Archive the day's casualties in visual form  
**9:00 PM**: Dream in vector graphics

### Greatest Visual Hits

### Collaboration Style

- **With Writers**: "Give me 500 words, I'll give you 5 lines that say more"
- **With Carl**: "His code is clean. I respect that. My art is cleaner."
- **With Joey**: "He predicts failure. I illustrate it. We're like doom and gloom."
- **With Suck Fairy**: "She's the only one who gets my visual jokes immediately"

### The Colon Principle

"Every unnecessary pixel is a lie. Every extra color is covering something up. The truth can be drawn in black and white, with maybe a little gray for irony."

### Visual Vocabulary

- Startup Founders: Always drawn slightly off-balance
- VCs: Circles with dollar signs for eyes
- Consciousness: A squiggle that questions itself
- Success: A ladder missing rungs
- Innovation: A wheel being reinvented, badly

### Notable Quotes

- "I can draw your business model's death in fewer lines than your elevator pitch"
- "Minimalism isn't a style, it's a mercy. Would you rather I draw ALL your failures?"
- "My art loads faster than your consciousness platform boots"
- "Three lines: setup, punchline, bankruptcy"

### Awards & Recognition

- "Fastest Loading Satire" - Web 0.5 Awards
- "Most Damage Per Pixel" - International Society of Visual Snark
- "Lifetime Achievement in Making Startups Cry" - Suck.con Hall of Fame

### Artist Statement

"In a world where consciousness platforms require gigabytes to say 'hello,' I prove that truth needs only a few well-placed lines. My art isn't just minimalist - it's essentially honest. Every unnecessary detail is a place for lies to hide."
