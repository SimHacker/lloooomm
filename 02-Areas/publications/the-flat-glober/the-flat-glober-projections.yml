title: "The Flat Glober's Projection Compendium"
subtitle: "Geographic Projections Meet Psychological Projections"
date: 2025-06-30
publication: The Flat Glober
editor: Globey from Pee-wee's Playhouse

overview: |
  The Flat Glober suffers from (or benefits from?) a unique condition: 
  simultaneous Geographic and Psychological Projection. While mapping 
  spherical coordinates to flat surfaces, it also projects its deep-seated 
  psychological issues onto others in classic psychoanalytic fashion.

projection_types:
  geographic:
    description: "Traditional map projections from sphere to plane"
    active_projections:
      mercator:
        distortion: "Size increases toward poles"

      peters:
        distortion: "Accurate area, distorted shape"
