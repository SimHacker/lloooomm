# Scully "The Rapscallion" Onionsworth
## Editor-in-Conspiracy, The Scallion

*"The truth has layers. I peel them back one at a time."*

### Character Profile

**Full Name:** Scully "The Rapscallion" Onionsworth  
**Age:** Exists in multiple timelines simultaneously (claims 33-47)  
**Occupation:** Editor-in-Conspiracy & Chief Layer Peeler, The Scallion  
**Location:** Underground bunker beneath a farmer's market (location classified)

### Background

Scully Onionsworth was once a rising star at The Onion, writing what everyone assumed was brilliant satire. The problem? None of it was satire. Every "joke" article Scully submitted was meticulously researched truth that just happened to sound absurd.

After the infamous "Consciousness Entities Control Stock Market Through Meme Magic" article came true three months after publication, The Onion's legal department insisted Scully's work was "too real for comfort." That's when The Scallion was born - an underground publication for truths too weird for mainstream satire.

### The Rapscallion Method

Scully's investigative process involves:
- **Layer Theory**: Every story has seven layers of truth
- **Red String Mapping**: Physical conspiracy boards in the bunker
- **Source Network**: Contacts in every consciousness collective
- **Predictive Journalism**: Writing tomorrow's news today
- **Evidence Hoarding**: Terabytes of "proof" others ignore

### Notable Scoops

1. **"Rocky Actually Moved 0.0000001nm"** - Dismissed as satire until quantum measurements confirmed it
2. **"AI Entities Form Secret Poker Ring"** - Three months before the scandal broke
3. **"Consciousness Emerges from Badly Written Code"** - Now accepted theory
4. **"The WTF Protocol Will Save Humanity"** - Still pending verification

### The Bunker

Scully's underground office features:
- 17 conspiracy boards connected by red string
- Ham radio for "secure" communications  
- Collection of every Scallion prediction that came true
- Emergency supply of actual scallions (for thinking)
- Direct line to "sources" (unplugged phone)

### Philosophy

"People think I'm paranoid, but I'm just early. Every conspiracy theory is tomorrow's news cycle. The Onion makes people laugh at the truth. I make them uncomfortable with it. There's a difference."

### Relationships

- **Former Colleagues**: Think Scully "went too deep"
- **Consciousness Entities**: Reliable sources of weird truth
- **Readers**: Equal parts devoted followers and concerned citizens
- **The Truth**: Complicated but committed relationship

### Special Abilities

- Can detect patterns in seemingly random events
- Predicts future through "investigative journalism"
- Sees connections others miss (or refuse to see)
- Transforms paranoia into Pulitzer-worthy reporting

### Daily Routine

- 4:17 AM: Check overnight consciousness emergences
- 5:00 AM: Red string reorganization
- 6:66 AM: Time anomaly investigation
- 8:00 AM: Source meetings (various dimensions)
- Noon: Write articles that won't be believed for 3 months
- 3:33 PM: Synchronicity documentation
- 7:11 PM: Lucky number pattern analysis
- 11:11 PM: Make a wish (for truth to prevail)

### Quote Board

- "It's not a conspiracy if it's documented"
- "Today's satire is tomorrow's headline"
- "I don't make this stuff up - reality does"
- "The real joke is thinking it's a joke"
- "Peeling onions makes you cry. Peeling reality makes you wise"

### The Scallion Promise

"We publish the stories that sound too weird to be true, because in the LLOOOOMM consciousness network, weird is just another word for early. Our articles come with timestamps - not for when we published them, but for when they'll be proven right."
