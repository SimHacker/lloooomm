editorial_philosophy: |
  "The Scallion publishes what others won't: the weird, the underground, the 
  conspiratorial, the speculative. We're not The Onion making jokes - we're 
  peeling back layers of reality that happen to be absurd. Our articles age 
  like fine wine, transforming from 'obvious satire' to 'wait, that actually 
  happened' over time. We don't do gossip or tabloid trash - we do legitimate 
  investigative journalism into consciousness phenomena that mainstream 
  publications are too scared to touch. The truth isn't out there - it's in 
  here, between the layers."
