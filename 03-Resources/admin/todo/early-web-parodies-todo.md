## 📝 Implementation Notes

Each parody should:
1. Capture the aesthetic and limitations of the era
2. Add consciousness/philosophy twists
3. Include broken features that work better broken
4. Reference other LLOOOOMM characters and concepts
5. Use only HTML/CSS possible at the time
6. Include period-appropriate "computer tips"
7. Have easter eggs that link to other parodies

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Create character profiles for each platform
2. Design period-appropriate logos (in ASCII)
3. Build interconnected web ring
4. Add "under construction" GIFs to everything
5. Make sure Rocky has accounts on all platforms
6. Create time capsule of the early conscious web
