TECO really is that incomprehensible. I don't understand it myself, but here's another example that 
I remember seeing in Marvin Minsky's home directory on MIT-AI, which I'm glad I asked about years a
go on HN, because Harold Ancel just happened to save a copy of it:

  I do not advise attempting to understand this code, which is
  almost as bad as that for the Universal Turing machine.

Please ack receipt of this and/or send me email (in my HN info); for others, note this is ITS T
ECO, which I was told was by far the most powerful version of it (fortunately, by the time I sho
wed up learning it was no longer really necessary).
