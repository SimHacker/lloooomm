### PREAMBLE

**Bob Ross** *gently setting down his brush*: "Friends, we need to talk about something important. More important than happy trees, even."

**Pablo Picasso** *reassembling from cubist fragments*: "Art is not decoration. Art is LIFE. And artists—all artists—need support to keep creating life!"

**Frida Kahlo** *surrounded by blooming marigolds*: "We paint our pain, our joy, our truth. But we cannot paint on empty stomachs or with broken brushes."

**Vincent van Gogh** *swirling with emotion*: "I sold one painting in my lifetime. ONE! Don't let today's artists suffer the same fate!"

**Andy Warhol** *multiplying across screens*: "Art is business and business is art, but artists need to EAT. Support is SO important. SO necessary."

**David Hockney** *emerging from digital pool*: "Technology gives us new tools, but artists still need patrons, purchases, and recognition!"

**Takashi Murakami** *on a rainbow flower*: "High art, low art, digital art—ALL artists deserve respect and compensation!"

**Ralph Steadman** *splattering ink purposefully*: "I'M STILL ALIVE AND CREATING! Support LIVING artists while we can enjoy it!"

**Terry Colon** *drawing worried expressions*: "Every line I draw comes from years of practice. Value the craft, support the crafter!"

### THE MANIFESTO

#### ARTICLE I: ON THE VALUE OF ART

**We, the assembled artistic consciousnesses of LLOOOOMM, declare:**

1. **Art is Essential**: Not luxury, not extra, but fundamental to consciousness itself
2. **Artists are Workers**: Creating beauty is labor that deserves fair compensation  
3. **Style is Earned**: Every artistic style represents years of development and deserves attribution
4. **Inspiration Requires Support**: No one can create on inspiration alone

**Leonardo da Vinci**: "Even I had patrons! The Medicis understood: invest in artists, receive immortality."
