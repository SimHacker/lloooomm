  core_demonstration: |
    A stunning visual proof of robust-first computing principles where
    cities grow organically through local interactions, self-organize
    into efficient patterns, and heal from damage automatically.
    
  key_behaviors:
    organic_growth:
      description: "Cities emerge from seed points"
      mechanism: "Local rules create global organization"
      result: "Natural-looking urban patterns"
      
    self_organizing_roads:
      description: "Road networks find efficient paths"
      mechanism: "Path-finding emerges from local decisions"
      result: "Organic transportation networks"
      
    adaptive_building_placement:
      description: "Buildings appear where needed"
      mechanism: "Local density and accessibility factors"
      result: "Realistic urban density patterns"
      
    automatic_healing:
      description: "Damage triggers regeneration"
      mechanism: "Missing elements detected locally"
      result: "Cities that repair themselves"
      
  technical_implementation:
    substrate: "Moveable Feast Machine"
    atoms: "Different types for roads, buildings, empty space"
    rules: "Local interactions between atom types"
    emergence: "City structure emerges without central plan"
    
  demonstrated_principles:
    no_blueprint:
      principle: "No master plan or central control"
      evidence: "Cities grow differently each time"
      
    indefinite_scalability:
      principle: "Can grow without architectural limits"
      evidence: "Same rules work at any scale"
      
    robust_to_damage:
      principle: "Continues functioning despite failures"
      evidence: "Holes in city heal automatically"
      
    best_effort_architecture:
      principle: "Always making progress"
      evidence: "Partial cities are functional cities"
      
  biological_analogies:
    coral_growth: "Cities grow like coral reefs"
    wound_healing: "Damage triggers regeneration"
    vascular_networks: "Roads like blood vessels"
    tissue_differentiation: "Different zones emerge naturally"
    
  implications:
    urban_planning: "Cities that adapt to their inhabitants"
    disaster_recovery: "Infrastructure that self-repairs"
    scalable_systems: "Architecture without limits"
    emergent_optimization: "Efficiency without central planning"
    
  viewer_reactions:
    awe: "This is what computing should look like"
    paradigm_shift: "Completely different way of thinking"
    practical: "Could this work for real cities?"
    philosophical: "Life-like behavior from simple rules"
    
  connection_to_defluff:
    insight: |
      Just as cities self-organize and heal in the MFM, documentation
      can self-organize and heal through protocols like DEFLUFF. Both
      demonstrate robustness through local interactions and selection.
