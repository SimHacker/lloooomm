  core_concept: |
    A differentiable model of morphogenesis that learns to grow 
    complex patterns from a single cell using only local interactions,
    mimicking biological development.
    
  key_innovations:
    differentiable_ca:
      description: "Cellular automata with learnable update rules"
      benefit: "Can be trained with gradient descent"
      
    persistent_patterns:
      description: "Patterns that maintain themselves when grown"
      benefit: "Demonstrates true self-organization"
      
    regeneration:
      description: "Patterns that heal when damaged"
      benefit: "Robust to perturbations like biological systems"
      
    local_only:
      description: "Each cell only sees immediate neighbors"
      benefit: "Scales indefinitely without architectural changes"
      
  biological_inspiration:
    embryogenesis: "Single cell develops into complex organism"
    regeneration: "Salamanders regrow lost limbs"
    homeostasis: "Living systems maintain their form"
    morphogen_gradients: "Chemical signals guide development"
    
  technical_details:
    cell_state: "16-dimensional vectors per cell"
    update_rule: "Small neural network (learned)"
    training: "Backpropagation through time"
    loss_function: "Match target pattern + stability"
    
  remarkable_properties:
    - "Learns to grow from any starting configuration"
    - "Robust to damage during growth"
    - "Patterns are attractors in dynamical system"
    - "Exhibits biological-like development stages"
    
  connection_to_mfm:
    shared_principles:
      - "Local interactions create global patterns"
      - "Robustness through redundancy"
      - "Self-healing and regeneration"
      - "No central control"
      
    differences:
      - "Neural CA are differentiable, MFM is discrete"
      - "Neural CA trained, MFM programmed/evolved"
      - "Neural CA deterministic, MFM stochastic"
      
  implications:
    for_ai: "Learning systems that grow and heal"
    for_robotics: "Self-assembling, self-repairing robots"
    for_computing: "Programs that develop like organisms"

    This connects beautifully to the Moveable Feast Machine - both are
    exploring how complex, robust systems can emerge from simple local
    rules. The differentiable aspect opens up new possibilities for
    learning these rules rather than hand-crafting them.
