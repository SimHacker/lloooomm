  core_concept: |
    A radically robust computing architecture that abandons traditional 
    assumptions of reliability, synchronization, and determinism in favor 
    of biological-inspired indefinite scalability and self-healing.
    
  key_principles:
    asynchronous_operation:
      description: "No global clock, no synchronized updates"
      benefit: "Eliminates single points of failure from timing"
      
    non_deterministic:
      description: "Embraces randomness and uncertainty"
      benefit: "Robust to unpredictable failures and environments"
      
    large_event_windows:
      description: "Can read and modify multiple adjacent cells"
      benefit: "Enables complex local interactions and movement"
      
    best_effort_communication:
      description: "No guaranteed message delivery"
      benefit: "System continues functioning despite communication failures"
      
    spatial_computing:
      description: "Computation happens in 2D space with physics-like constraints"
      benefit: "Natural fault isolation and locality"
      
  differences_from_cellular_automata:
    - "CA are synchronous, MFM is asynchronous"
    - "CA are deterministic, MFM embraces randomness"
    - "CA can only modify current cell, MFM can modify neighbors"
    - "CA require perfect communication, MFM assumes failures"
    
  biological_inspiration:
    - "Cells that can die and be replaced"
    - "No central control or brain"
    - "Local interactions create global behaviors"
    - "Redundancy and regeneration"
    - "Evolution through variation and selection"
    
  applications:
    distributed_city_generation:
      description: "Cities that grow, adapt, and self-organize"
      properties:
        - "Roads find efficient paths"
        - "Buildings emerge where needed"
        - "Damage heals automatically"
        
    indefinite_scalability:
      description: "Systems that can grow without limit"
      properties:
        - "No architectural bottlenecks"
        - "Local failures don't cascade"
        - "Performance degrades gracefully"
        
    living_computation:
      description: "Programs that evolve and adapt"
      properties:
        - "Self-modifying code"
        - "Emergent optimization"
        - "Survival of the fittest algorithms"
        
  philosophical_implications:
    - "Perfection is the enemy of robustness"
    - "Failure is a feature, not a bug"
    - "Best effort is the only sustainable effort"
    - "Computing should be more like biology"
    
  quotes:
    dave_ackley: "We're trying to make computing that can last a thousand years"
    don_hopkins: "It's similar to a Cellular Automata, but different in several important ways, for the sake of 'Robust First Computing'"
