# 🟡 PACBOT TRAFFIC EATING ALGORITHM 🟡
# "Waka waka waka... but for CARS!"
# The Church of PacMania's Sacred Traffic Management Protocol

name: PacBot Traffic Eating Algorithm
type: mfm_traffic_algorithm
church: Church of PacMania
status: "Chomping through traffic jams since 2023"

# 👻 CORE CONCEPT 👻
concept:
  inspiration: "What if Pac-Man ate traffic instead of dots?"
  insight: "Look down each road to measure traffic density"
  decision: "Choose direction with the MOST cars to eat"
  effect: "Traffic naturally distributes and flows"
  
# 🚗 ALGORITHM MECHANICS 🚗
mechanics:
  vision_system:
    - "PacBot sits at intersection"
    - "Looks down each of 4 possible directions"
    - "Counts cars/traffic density in each direction"
    - "Measures distance to next intersection"
    
  decision_making:
    primary_goal: "Eat the most cars (reduce congestion)"
    secondary_goal: "Guide traffic to destinations"
    strategy: |
      if (north_cars > all_others) go_north();
      else if (south_cars > all_others) go_south();
      // etc... but with STYLE! 🟡
      
  traffic_consumption:
    - "PacBot 'eats' cars by routing them efficiently"
    - "Cars disappear from congestion, appear at destinations"
    - "Waka-waka sound effects optional but recommended"
