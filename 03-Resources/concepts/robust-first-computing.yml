  core_thesis: |
    Traditional computing prioritizes correctness and efficiency at the cost 
    of fragility. Robust-first computing inverts this, prioritizing survival 
    and adaptability even at the cost of occasional incorrectness.
    
  fundamental_shift:
    from:
      - "Correctness first, robustness maybe"
      - "Deterministic and predictable"
      - "Failure is unacceptable"
      - "Perfect or nothing"
      - "Centralized control"
      
    to:
      - "Robustness first, correctness emerges"
      - "Stochastic and adaptive"
      - "Failure is information"
      - "Best effort always"
      - "Distributed autonomy"
      
  key_principles:
    embrace_failure:
      motto: "Failure isn't a bug, it's a feature"
      implementation: "Design systems that expect and recover from failures"
      
    indefinite_scalability:
      motto: "No architectural limits"
      implementation: "Local interactions only, no global dependencies"
      
    best_effort_computing:
      motto: "Perfect is the enemy of good enough"
      implementation: "Always make progress, even if imperfect"
      
    living_systems:
      motto: "Computation should be alive"
      implementation: "Self-healing, self-organizing, self-improving"
      
  von_neumann_critique:
    problem: "Von Neumann architecture assumes perfect components"
    symptoms:
      - "Single bit errors crash entire systems"
      - "Scaling requires exponentially more perfection"
      - "Brittleness increases with complexity"
      
    solution: "Abandon the assumption of perfection"
    benefits:
      - "Systems that heal from damage"
      - "Complexity that doesn't increase fragility"
      - "True indefinite scalability"
      
  biological_analogies:
    cells: "Compute locally, die gracefully, replaced constantly"
    evolution: "Bad code dies, good code reproduces"
    immune_system: "Identify and eliminate harmful patterns"
    healing: "Damage triggers regeneration, not failure"
