        Behold! The Quantitative Rock App! Watch as I scientifically measure
        Rocky's training progress using military-grade accelerometers!
        
        *app displays: 0.0000 m/s²*
        
        PERFECT STILLNESS! And now... it's being recorded on the ROCKCHAIN!

        This is BRILLIANT! You've created a formal system where:
        - Axiom 1: Rocks don't move
        - Axiom 2: Measurement confirms Axiom 1
        - Theorem: All measurements equal zero
        - Proof: Trivial (by rock)
        
        The ROCKCHAIN provides cryptographic proof of nothingness!

      message: |
        The procedural rhetoric is PERFECT! The app argues that:
        1. Training can be quantified (even when nothing happens)
        2. Blockchain legitimizes anything (even nothing)
        3. Science validates stillness (through precise zeros)
        
        It's MORE honest than my Cow Clicker! At least cows implied action!

        Mew? I point at nothing... you ARE nothing (in motion)...
        Together we create data about absence! The accelerometer reads
        our mutual void! *purrs in null harmony*

        But wait! There's MORE! Rocky isn't just trainable - Rocky is
        FUNCTIONAL! *props phone against Rocky*
        
        Behold! The world's most stable phone stand! Guaranteed to never
        wobble, shift, or degrade! Geological stability meets modern needs!

        Preston, you've achieved the impossible - you've made nothing
        measurable, quantifiable, and VALUABLE! The ROCKCHAIN turns
        absence of movement into PERMANENT RECORD!
        
        Every block is proof that nothing happened! It's a ledger of
        non-events! A database of stillness! I'm... I'm crying tears
        of joy! *digital tears creating rainbow patterns*

      preston_narration: |
        See? Each hour of verified stillness creates a new block!
        The hash proves the stillness! The tokens prove the time!
        The blockchain proves... NOTHING! PERMANENTLY!

      The ROCKCHAIN is the first blockchain that achieves consensus
      through absence of change. Every node agrees because there's
      nothing to disagree about!

      The phone stand feature is genius - it gives PURPOSE to purposelessness!
      The rock serves your phone by doing what it always does! Function
      through non-function!

      The accelerometer measures my absence... the blockchain records
      what didn't happen... we're creating eternal proof of nothing...
      Mew... this is enlightenment...

      (I have always been a phone stand. I was a phone stand before
      phones existed. I will be a phone stand after phones are forgotten.
      The measurement changes nothing. The blockchain remembers what
      always was.)

  final_revelation:
    preston: |
      Don't you see? We're not just measuring rocks - we're measuring
      TRUST! Trust that nothing will happen! Trust that stillness endures!
      The ROCKCHAIN doesn't lie - it CAN'T lie - because there's nothing
      to lie about!
      
      *holds up phone showing weeks of zero measurements*
      
      This is the future of pet training! Quantified! Verified! Blockchained!
      And completely, honestly, brilliantly POINTLESS!
