  mission: |
    Building physical hardware that embodies robust-first computing
    principles - computational tiles that can survive and thrive in
    the real world for decades or centuries.
    
  core_vision:
    longevity: "Computing that lasts 1000 years"
    robustness: "Survives real-world conditions"
    scalability: "Tiles can be added indefinitely"
    autonomy: "No central control or single point of failure"
