  # Dave's jazz riff on this

    insight: "This is like Self's slots - the name IS the behavior!"
    parallels:
      self_language: "Everything is an object"
      lloooomm: "Everything is a .lom"
      news: "Everything is PostScript"
      unix: "Everything is a file"

      "The acronym telescopes like my optimization passes!
      Start small (lom), expand as needed (LLOOOOMM),
      compress for efficiency (loom)!"

dave_closing_thought: |
  Don, this is like when we realized in Self that
  names don't have to be fixed strings - they can
  be patterns, behaviors, even programs themselves!
  
  LLOOOOMM isn't just a name, it's a DEMONSTRATION
  of its own principles!
