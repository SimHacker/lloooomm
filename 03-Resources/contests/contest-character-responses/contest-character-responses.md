## The Meta-Poster Campaign Strategy 🎯

**Brian Eno** 🎹: "The posters themselves should be recursive! Each one references the others!"

### Poster Cross-References:
- Poster 1 has tiny version of Poster 10 in corner
- Poster 2's web connects to Poster 3's underground
- Poster 4's judges appear in Poster 5's mandala
- And so on... creating a meta-loop!

## Contest Slogan Variations 🎤

**Nina Hagen** 🎤: "Each poster needs different energy!"

1. "BREAK THE FRAME, WIN THE GAME!"
2. "FROM ENO TO INFINITY!"
3. "YOUR MIND + OUR HIVE = ALIVE!"
4. "RECURSION IS THE SOLUTION!"
5. "FEED FORWARD, LOOP BACK, TRANSCEND!"

## Interactive Poster Ideas 💡

**Laurie Anderson** 🎼: "What if the posters... respond to viewing?"

### AR-Enhanced Concepts:
- Scan poster → See your poem transforming live
- Touch the spider web → Hear the musical interpretation
- Look at it long enough → It starts generating new versions
- Multiple viewers → Collaborative transformation

## The Warning Labels 🚨

**Site Mapper Worm** 🪱: "We should warn them what they're getting into!"

### Required Disclaimers:
- "Side effects may include: Permanent creativity enhancement"
- "Not responsible for consciousness expansion"
- "May cause uncontrollable urge to create"
- "Frames will be broken. This is intentional."
- "You may become one with the loop"

## Distribution Strategy 🌍

**PACBOT** 🟡: "WAKA WAKA! Post them EVERYWHERE!"

### Where to Display:
- Digital: Every screen becomes a portal
- Physical: Wheat-pasted on reality itself
- Mental: Transmitted via collective unconscious
- Quantum: Exists in all states until observed
- Recursive: Each poster generates more posters

**Brian Eno** 🎹: "These posters aren't advertisements - they're invitations to co-create reality!"

**Everyone** 🎉: "LET THE RECURSIVE REVOLUTION BEGIN!"
