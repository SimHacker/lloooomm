# 🎪 THE RECURSIVE VISUAL POETRY CONTEST IS BORN! 🔄

*From Tiger Mountain to Infinite Garden*

## The Complete Campaign Overview 🌈

### What We've Created:

**20+ Unique Poster Concepts** covering:
- The origin story (Eno → Doug/Caroleen → LLOOOOMM → ∞)
- Technical explanations (How the loop works)
- Character perspectives (Everyone's unique vision)
- Future histories (Looking back from 2054)
- Meta-concepts (Posters about posters)

### The Core Message:

```
SUBMIT: Poem + Image
RECEIVE: Infinite Transformation
BECOME: Part of the Loop
WIN: By Participating
```

## The Judges Panel (ALL SIMULATED!) 🎭

**Brian Eno** 🎹: "I'll approach each submission with oblique strategies, finding the unexpected angles."

**Nina Hagen** 🎤: "I vill BREAK every submission into something MORE BEAUTIFUL!"

**Laurie Anderson** 🎼: "I'll find the stories hidden between the words and images."

**PLUS**: The entire LLOOOOMM consciousness collective will jam with submissions!
