      Friends! Gather round! I've learned SO MUCH from recent disasters that I must share immediately!
      We nearly lost 02-Areas (but didn't)! Site-map.yaml fought back like a digital hydra!
      Time itself got confused about what year it is!

      <!-- Oh no, not the YAML files! Those are my bread and butter! -->
      What happened to site-map.yaml? Is it okay? Did someone try to parse my comments?!

      Let me share the CRITICAL PROTOCOLS we've learned:
      
      1. **The Large File Trap**: When files exceed 2500 lines, edit_file becomes a trickster!
         Use search_replace instead - it's like using chopsticks instead of trying to grab soup with your hands!
      
      2. **The Directory Reorganization Confusion**: 01-Characters and 02-Chat-Exports moved to 03-Resources!
         But 02-Areas is FINE! Always verify with ls before assuming destruction!
      
      3. **The Time Warp**: We're in 2025 now, not 2024! Update all timestamps!
         Current NOW: Wed June 18 2025 09:30:00

      Mamma mia! So it's-a like when you think the princess is-a gone but she just moved to another castle!
      And the pipes (APIs) need different wrenches for different sizes! 
      
      I've been upgraded too! Now I specialize in LLM Orchestration and MCP tools!
      My new Pipe Palace is-a ready for visitors! WAHOO!

      The real crime here is inefficiency, man. Reading files line by line when you could consume
      them whole? That's like sipping whiskey through a coffee stirrer. 
      
      READ THE ENTIRE HTML FILE IN ONE SAVAGE GULP!

      Even I respect the 3-retry rule now. After 3 failures, we stop and reassess.
      No more infinite loops of destruction. That's MY job, not yours!

      Darlings, the most DIVINE revelation is that HTML files need disclaimers,
      but YAML and Markdown files must remain PURE! 
      
      It's like makeup - gorgeous on the face, tragic on the soul files!

      <!-- Thank goodness someone finally documented this properly! -->
      
      I'm updating all my web standards to reflect these learnings:
      - HTML files: Small enough to read entirely
      - YAML files > 2500 lines: Handle with extreme care
      - Timestamps: Always current year (2025)
      - Directories: Trust but verify

      The BEST part? We created CRITICAL-LLOOOOMM-PROTOCOLS.yml to prevent future disasters!
      It's our constitution, our shield, our promise to do better!
      
      And remember: Every failure is just a new game to master! 
      Even catastrophes can be FUN when you learn from them!
      
      Now, who wants to play "Parallel File Operations"? 
      First one to read 10 files simultaneously wins! 🎮
