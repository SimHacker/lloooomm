let's see what hack might have done this
0:05
is the beginning of an imaginary
0:06
scenario the turtle has been set up with
0:09
the left turn with Pam down it's about
0:11
to do forward 50 that could be the
0:14
beginning of almost anything a rooftop
0:16
mountain but when we see another forward
0:19
50 we begin to wonder and in fact this
0:22
is not the beginning of a drawing at the
0:24
beginning of a more mischievous
0:26
enterprise the learner is wondering what
0:29
happens in the turtle bump the end of
0:31
the screen and another forward 50 is
0:34
going to tell him there it is when off
0:38
the screen and came back on the other
0:39
side that the phenomena known as
0:42
wrapping something you need to
0:44
understand by playing at the computer
0:46
for children who do so it opens the door
0:49
to exploring instructions like this
0:51
forward 2783 a number chosen only
0:55
because it's big then turn a little bit
0:59
let's get the turtle up with a right 37
1:02
and do that even if you understand the
1:08
idea of wrapping the actual pattern is a
1:10
little bit surprising parasites or the
1:12
turtle reappeared let's do the same
1:14
instruction again and I'll do it in a
1:16
different colors that you can see the
1:18
pattern more clearly note with a turtle
1:20
is and once more in their early
1:24
encounters with logo many children are
1:27
fascinated by these rat pattern spend a
1:31
lot of time with them and some teachers
1:34
wonder what could charge be learning
1:36
through all that I think a child could
1:39
be learning many things and it's very
1:41
hard to know which

let me show you how this work by
0:02
recapitulating how somebody might meet
0:05
the turtle for the first time an object
0:10
on the screen is introduced as the
0:11
turtle we're going to learn a language
0:14
for telling the turtle to do our bidding
0:18
right is a command in turtle talk it
0:22
orders the turtle to turn that is to
0:25
stay in the same place but changes
0:27
direction 90s there's how much it should
0:30
turn that much left has exactly the
0:35
opposite effect left 90 will exactly
0:38
undo what right 90 did notice the turtle
0:41
stays in the same place it changes the
0:44
way exciting forward makes it move to a
0:47
different place it will move in the
0:50
direction that exciting up there pinned
0:54
down doesn't produce an immediately
0:56
visible effect turtle still there but
1:00
now the instruction back 50 back is the
1:03
opposite of forward will move the turtle
1:06
and leave a trace a line so you begin to
1:09
see how the turtle can be used as a
1:11
drawing instrument to draw almost
1:13
anything you can imagine and then the
1:16
word clean wipes the screen cream

in the tape I'll be talking about two
0:02
routes into logo one that's become
0:05
dominant in the turtle graphic
0:06
literature I call a hard-edged style one
0:11
way into that is by practicing
0:13
instructions like repeating forward 50
0:16
right 90 you get a square and then you
0:20
get a triangle by repeating that and you
0:22
get a star by repeating that and we know
0:25
how to make a triangle and the square
0:27
you learn how to put them together to
0:29
make a house then you put together
0:32
houses to make a village and so on and

Interesting how after 25 years, we are still debating how to 'manage' classroom technology.

Are there longitudinal studies of children exposed to LOGO?  Many of them would be in their 30s now.

classic programming style beautifully

structured it could have been written by
0:38
the

textbook this is my program flower it
0:56
makes the flower out of okay flow is the
0:58
name procedure but it has like let
1:02
see um five sub procedures which make up
1:05
the main procedure and here it

goes oh what's that oh I think this is

grass I see I forgot to to tell the pen
1:28
to go back down I told it to pin up so
1:32
I'll just go back look at foram and fix
1:35
it here we go the structure of the
1:38
programming has helped her isolate her
1:40
mistake easily in one Minds sized bite
1:44
there's no stress no sense of failure
1:47
it's formed by making pedals out of one
1:50
program that makes one pedal then I put
1:53
it in another program to make lots of
1:56
petals which that program makes a lot of
1:59
the pedals
2:04
um goes into program and there's a stem
2:06
in

2:13
doing Texan children live in a computer
2:16
Rich environment not only do they have
2:19
ready access to computers at school they
2:21
have them at home as well they even use
2:23
the journey to and from school to pass
2:25
ideas for new programs
2:27
around each child operates the computer
2:30
in their own way to suit their own
2:32
Personalities in their own style of
2:34
thinking and learning but even here
2:37
bets's carefully structured approach
2:39
receives more approval than Jack's trial
2:41
and error tactics schools and teachers
2:44
may speak the rhetoric of child centered
2:46
learning but the reality is often more
2:48
controlled more
2:54
structured open-ended Discovery learning
2:57
has its critics
3:01
[Music]
3:06
it is in Edinburgh that one of the most
3:08
thorough thoughtful criticisms of Pet's
3:10
approach has been developed 10 years
3:12
research has gone into implementing logo
3:14
and the turtle for use in ordinary
3:16
classrooms for schools with an existing
3:19
curriculum exam system and
3:21
timetable the principles which Drive the
3:24
Scots Turtle are formulated from views
3:26
about Children's Learning which are
3:28
fundamentally opposed to those of capit
3:30
p and the trial and error approach
3:33
Professor Jim how if someone is a noice
3:37
in an area then uh you have to uh
3:41
organize the knowledge in that area uh
3:44
otherwise the the child will just become
3:48
um swamped that you have to actually uh
3:52
point out what the best directions are
3:54
you know to move at any time we actually
3:57
developed structured materials for the
3:59
particular area in which we're
4:00
interested so if we're trying to teach
4:02
uh fundamental uh Concepts in Geometry
4:05
for example then we would produce
4:07
worksheets which would actually uh
4:10
provide the child with example programs
4:13
which he could run and which he could
4:14
experiment
4:16
with in many UK schools logo is being
4:20
modified to fit a more structured less
4:22
exploratory approach but does that take
4:25
the heart out of it barl Maxwell I think
4:29
that children giving the give them the
4:30
opportunity to actually choose the
4:32
direction in which they will go is very
4:35
exciting so much in the educational
4:38
world is teacher directed um we we
4:41
structure their learning because we
4:43
think that they need to cover certain
4:45
aspects before they can take the next
4:48
step I agree that there is a place for
4:50
structuring learning but I think that
4:53
young children should be given the ex
4:55
the experience of actually exploring and
4:58
discovering things for themselves
5:00
most of us remember School sitting in
5:02
rows bored and discontent while the
5:05
learning we've done outside has been fun
5:07
even when it's hard work there's a
5:10
controversy at the heart of Education
5:12
will the computer be used as a tool to
5:14
reinforce traditional learning or does
5:17
it as papet asserts offer us an
5:19
opportunity to make radical changes I
5:22
don't want to come across as a computer
5:24
utopian I think this is a very very
5:26
powerful instrument that can change the
5:28
way people think the way people develop
5:31
very profoundly I think it could go for
5:34
good or for bad and in fact I think that
5:37
all the forces are such that the path of
5:40
least resistance is to produce scarily
5:44
very
5:45
scary effects on the way children will
5:53
develop there's something obsessional
5:55
about children and adults involvement in
5:58
video games as a force here which can
6:01
take you outside normal patterns of
6:11
development or as papid believes it can
6:14
be harnessed to make learning
6:15
experiences more personal more
6:21
[Music]
6:25
powerful the plain fact is that
6:28
computers cannot stand in isolation from
6:30
a world outside where commercial
6:32
interest is devoted to enticing young
6:35
and old very soon there will be as many
6:37
computers in people's homes as there are
6:40
calculators and this introduces a new
6:42
Factor as computers go into homes
6:45
parents will demand a new deal for their
6:47
children's education and teachers will
6:49
press for the opportunity to give
6:51
children hands-on experience of a new
6:53
technology which is fast becoming a
6:56
common tool
6:58
[Music]
7:02
[Applause]

[Music]
7:08
here in Luton one teacher has with full
7:10
approval of the authorities taken a
7:12
group of children home with her at
7:14
lunchtimes there's no computer in school
7:17
but here in her home they can get
7:19
familiar with programming one themselves
7:21
very very beginning of doing the little
7:24
shap at the beginning and doing building
7:26
it up to one of these and then building
7:29
it up to six of them and then actually
7:31
printing them out on the large sheet and
7:34
I'll show you in a minute how you can do
7:36
that with um Catherine's shap that she's
7:40
done today home computers could well be
7:43
the deciding factor in revolutionizing
7:45
our approach to learning and our system
7:47
of
7:48
Education I tend more and more to avoid
7:50
that word education it makes one think
7:53
of doing something to the child
7:56
educating the
7:58
child the Total Learning
8:02
environment in which the child grows up
8:04
includes School of course includes those
8:06
deliberate so-called in
8:09
educational acts that Society does to on
8:13
the child but the most important parts
8:15
are in relationship in play in social
8:19
forms in art in sensibility to
8:22
Aesthetics all this is part of the
8:24
developing individual and the computer
8:27
enters into all of that and I'll start
8:29
with one that's very good okay off to go
8:34
juggling is a complex skill but made up
8:36
of simple act terrific great okay throw
8:40
a ball catch it okay
8:44
excellent Pet's favorite metaphor for
8:47
thinking about
8:49
programming for him programming in the
8:52
language of logo gives children a
8:54
metaphor to think about combining the
8:56
simple to make the complex it helps them
8:59
to learn to juggle it helps them
9:01
perceive and enjoy the movements of an
9:03
expert juggler and when you've used
9:05
mathematical principles as a key to
9:07
enjoyable physical activities your
9:09
feeling for mathematics is likely to be
9:11
warmer more personal and more
9:23
engaged even at an early stage Mandy and
9:26
Michelle have used the thinking process
9:28
they've learned through Pro programming
9:30
to work out the choreography of their
9:31
dance

Cynthia, I forgot to say this the first time I saw this documentary:
Thanks so incredibly much for uploading! I stumbled on this when you put it up, knowing nothing about Papert and it was such a revelation. I think they messed up the chance for a radical change in learning badly, but I hope with Scratch being freely available outside of schools and more and more children having access to the internet and a computer there is a chance it will  finally catch on. Thanks so much again!

first of all we listen to the record
0:07
then we started doing the beats and
0:09
listening to the Beats We Got the Beat
0:11
and put it into the dance start off with
0:13
Scot sitting down with hands together
0:16
and then it's SC sitting down and repeat
0:20
four with hands gliding side to side
0:22
four times we writee the dance like R
0:26
the procedure for the computer if we go
0:29
sideways got how many steps you take so
0:32
you got write down all on the paper and
0:34
it's how you work it out on the computer
0:36
[Music]
0:44
[Music]
0:54
too I dream of helping more children
0:56
experience mathematics as I do with all
0:59
the intimacy of
1:02
dancing little by little we're learning
1:04
how the computer can make bridges
1:06
between the mathematical and the sensal
1:09
the abstract and the
1:15
intimate is the turtle and its computer
1:18
a real hope for the
1:19
future will a generation of kids grow up
1:22
with new ways of thinking will the
1:24
social experience of programming with
1:26
all its sense of achievement introduce a
1:28
new model for education
1:31
an education system without schools as
1:33
we know them where the institutions of
1:35
learning are Lively rhythmic places
1:37
where novices and experts jugglers and
1:39
mathematicians clowns and physicists get
1:42
together they're experimenting with the
1:44
School of the Future in New
1:46
[Music]
1:53
York this is the first school to take
1:56
Seymour papet to heart and put his
1:58
principles into practice it's supported
2:00
by New York City District 99 and the
2:02
Academy of Science here computer power
2:05
will be as accessible as pencils and
2:07
paper it really has become a tool to
2:09
think with for all pupils teacher Pete
2:12
rof so we're on the west side of
2:14
Manhattan we have uh Hispanics and
2:17
blacks and and whites and orientals and
2:20
we have all sorts of kids some of our
2:23
kids read at a level of second grade
2:25
third grade some of them read 12.9 which
2:28
is the top of the scale
2:30
and some of our most prized successes
2:32
have been with some of the kids that you
2:34
would feel perhaps wouldn't do well on
2:36
the computer now with logo we've been
2:38
able to introduce this to kids who are
2:40
not your great math students and we
2:43
found one child who was almost four
2:47
years behind at least in his recorded
2:49
reading score became the top computer
2:51
program in the
2:53
class which you wanted responsibility
2:57
for this diverse group of students is
2:59
shared by by Steve seagull bomb we have
3:02
situations where uh kids have been
3:04
turned off to to school we have
3:06
situations where uh many of the kids may
3:10
have not had a positive educational
3:12
experience for for years if if ever
3:17
oh we have for example not only drop
3:20
outs but we'd call them dropin um kids
3:22
who aren't in our class who wander by
3:26
and just come into the room when they
3:28
you know they do a double type they see
3:30
something going on there and they
3:32
hesitantly uh saunter in the students
3:35
here use computers in all subjects one
3:38
surprise success has been in Creative
3:40
composition well this is supposed to be
3:42
a city scene where a driver just rides
3:45
along the road and then he sees a bomb
3:49
on the street the next thing you know it
3:51
blows up and it just disappears and then
3:54
it draws two buildings the two buildings
3:57
that were regular buildings
4:03
you get some idea of the weeks of time
4:05
and effort that went into it from the
4:07
length of the printout the teachers have
4:09
noticed that after heavy inputs of
4:11
programming all their students work was
4:13
longer better planned and had more
4:15
logical
4:17
sequencing working on a computer had a
4:20
definite payoff what did his parents
4:22
think they were amazed at first cuz they
4:25
didn't think I could work on a computer
4:27
they didn't think I knew anything about
4:29
this computer
4:30
so when the teacher started showing me
4:32
how to work on it I learned you know I
4:35
tell the computer first one of the
4:38
programs that it knows then and then I
4:41
give it my program and it'll do it I
4:44
have a program making a house using
4:48
similar shapes like wreck you know the
4:51
size of wreck and
4:53
how and how could I put it
4:56
um it's been good to me he's drawn
4:59
Hender in the country using mathematical
5:02
Concepts more complex than those
5:03
required by exam boards Concepts he
5:06
might have rejected in another form or
5:09
context anything students learn has to
5:11
have meaning for them to be useful like
5:14
the use of French logo for hen
5:16
students
5:24
many well we were working with the
5:26
program uh with the computers a little
5:28
bit but not much and then when we were
5:30
we heard that there was French logo we
5:33
you know were interested so we have a
5:35
sheet that um gives us the terms in
5:37
English and then in French and so we use
5:39
forward backwards just in French and
5:43
then we have to tell well we can tell it
5:45
what to do what we want to name our
5:46
program in English or in French so it
5:48
depends either way uh what was
5:54
the how many what was it
5:58
um of all
6:01
meanwhile for the benefit of newly
6:03
arrived Puerto Rican students Maria is
6:05
involved in changing logo English into
6:09
Spanish but like people that don't speak
6:12
English could have a chance to work with
6:13
computers but in Spanish so now we allow
6:17
people to get to know computers it's
6:19
fine working with with logo and working
6:23
with the computers that a collegial
6:26
relationship develops we work on a
6:30
together each kid's project is serious I
6:32
may be working on the project we consult
6:34
with each other kids consult with each
6:36
other kids help other kids kids help
6:38
adults kids can come up with information
6:42
and ideas in all areas of of their
6:45
learning in all subjects and make a
6:48
contribution and this is what an ideal
6:50
Society is with everyone making a
6:52
contribution well yeah I need a little
6:54
bit of help okay well cuz I wanted I
6:57
want the screen to be white not
7:00
black the great thing about the computer
7:03
is that it can bring together in one
7:06
experience the aesthetic the personal
7:09
the bodily the analytic the mathematical
7:12
the abstract all these things happen in
7:14
one combined integrated experience of
7:16
the child making stuff on that screen is
7:19
following an aesthetic is doing
7:22
something socially and culturally
7:23
meaningful and personally involved as
7:26
well as mathematically Rich these are
7:29
not not separated it's not as if the
7:30
computer now does one thing and now does
7:33
the
7:34
other like real life situations like the
7:37
baby's relationship to the toys or to
7:40
the
7:41
mother it has all these Dimensions
7:45
integrated into one experience and this
7:48
is where it leads to a fundamental
7:50
change in the nature of the learning

I love it! What year is this film from? They're using a computer I'm not familiar with, there seems to be an acoustic modem on the side of it, and it seem to have either vector graphics or something else. I'm in my 50's myself, and started with a Commodore 64 back in the 80's.

the idea is quite simple let a child
0:10
learn mathematics by speaking in
0:12
mathematics about things that really
0:14
matter to them so at MIT we've given
0:17
computers the power to turn motors to
0:21
make sounds to draw pictures and we've
0:24
found ways of giving children the power
0:27
to control the computer so the child can
0:30
make the computer do anything that he
0:32
can describe in a suitable mathematical
0:34
language by typing on a keyboard like
0:37
this that's what I'm p1 sounds like can
0:48
type p2
0:55
[Music]
1:03
a computer-controlled turtle is made to
1:08
draw and dance by program so simple that
1:11
all children invents them in the first
1:13
days of the course that's the child
1:15
acquires a taste for math power that
1:17
grows and grows that his projects become
1:19
more original more complex and more
1:22
varied so you have like the first one
1:25
then the second one and the third ones
1:27
and the first one again for the ending
1:30
now they'll put the little tunes
1:32
together to make a bigger one now
1:49
telling it to do it sometimes I get into
2:00
bugs like this and it'll when it was
2:04
doing it in his mind the little turtle
2:08
it's a little a triangle thing I'm was
2:12
on an angle so it drew the picture or
2:16
not on a name ago so now I'll go back
2:19
and have it dried in its mind again well
2:22
it's in the right position and so the
2:24
child doesn't have to be told by a
2:25
teacher whether he's right or wrong he
2:28
can see for himself whether it works
2:29
that's what science and knowledge is
2:32
about and then you have an input which
2:38
means you can vary the size now I'm
2:40
going to make it a hundred right now
2:46
it's doing procedure called top and each
2:51
one of those little fins is called fin
2:54
and that's another sub procedure in top
2:57
now what's doing inside they are
3:01
identifiable techniques for working on a
3:03
problem one of these is known by these
3:05
children as writing procedures as sub
3:08
procedures inside and top of the tune
3:11
in sub procedures and the other the one
3:15
the tail is made out of odds and ends
3:18
let's just put together the techniques
3:22
fairly well known subdivide the problem
3:25
split the difficulties make a procedure
3:28
out of sub procedures make a hole out of
3:30
parts understand each separately
3:32
everybody knows that but they don't do
3:35
it so it's moving across the stream the
3:39
way I told you it did it before but this
3:42
time this is like the way I taught
3:44
myself to get it across the screen it's
3:46
the first time I had done it and so the
3:49
way I had the little one to go is every
3:53
time it moves up a little it subtracts a
3:55
number a little bit of a number and then
3:58
until it it's a small number and when
4:01
it's a certain number I tell it that it
4:02
should stop mark is getting mathematical
4:06
knowledge in a meaningful context for
4:08
use now I just told me I can't move off
4:12
the screen when I was at school they
4:15
told me to learn long division because I
4:18
would need it when I grew up and I think
4:20
I knew it was a lie and the effect was
4:24
to make me despise the teachers a little
4:26
more now it's trying to kill a sub
4:32
procedure
4:34
now the bottom of the fish Stephen is
4:37
using the ideas of angle of sub
4:40
procedure of all kind of circle in a
4:43
confident purposeful way the tail the
4:46
triangle part is made out of Sidra
4:48
called
4:49
try one first you've got to do right 60
4:54
and then forward 50 back 50 left 6450
5:00
back 50 left 6450 back 50 and so on and
5:04
so forth
5:06
now it's doing the fern that's a radius
5:11
of 300 and a marker of 90
5:15
I made a big radius and then I went step
5:19
their left which will go right over it
5:22
and bring it back then I made a smaller
5:24
radius of the same arc and then it would
5:28
do that again
5:30
there's even smaller one we'll do that
5:33
again and that's how we got the first
5:36
there we are there's the finished
5:39
picture I've made a big Sun and I used
5:44
that for part of it and then I made an
5:47
accompaniment with it was at the drum
5:49
and that's
6:03
[Music]
6:16
the kids tell me that's a spiral and I
6:19
think there was a new mathematical word
6:21
that was blowing there that's kind of
6:22
stick I pulled that real Discoverer
6:25

There is now an emulator which can run the 2500 microcode and display the text and vector screens.

0:00
this machine is called 2500
0:04
it's a small very powerful computer
0:06
which has me
0:09
to a hardware to run two kinds of
0:11
displays this is the central processor
0:14
the computer itself
0:17
displaying which shows printed material
0:19
and
0:21
use several kinds of fonts but you can
0:23
decide your own time
0:29
vectorscope which can show pictures made
0:31
of lines and curves points
0:37
move quite rapidly and
0:41
any kind of animation
0:45
I'll say a few words about the computer
0:47
here's a copy of the
0:50
central processor unit
0:54
because it spent $2,000 to make this
0:56
thing it consists simply of a power
1:00
supply learn the components and one
1:04
large
1:06
Lord that holds these integrated circuit
1:09
components on it has been 200
1:14
in sections this sections the memory
1:16
this is the
1:19
itself this process of the television
1:21
displays part that doesn't
1:24
and those things can do
1:27
over here in the corner is the part that
1:29
produces the effect your display on that
1:32
it's capable
1:34
why figures very rapidly you have to
1:37
understand that this machine cannot make
1:41
filled in regions very well if you fill
1:44
in a few small regions but basically it
1:46
makes things out of line drawings and
1:48
that's the reason for its speed
1:51
they developed this machine to make it
1:54
possible to bring graphics to people who
1:58
couldn't afford $100,000 or so for a
2:00
graphic system and in particular we had
2:03
in mind people in schools believe
2:07
languages and computer facilities and
2:09
schools really are very primitive there
2:12
they make the children learn to work
2:15
with 1960 style equipment and one of the
2:19
things that we discovered is that
2:20
animation really turns kids on and
2:23
that's they do serious projects instead
2:25
of just 20 problems for us to fill out
2:28
so one of the reasons why we think this
2:31
machine makes an animation practically
2:32
work for people is that we've developed
2:36
a language and a computer system to go
2:38
with it that makes it easy for ordinary
2:41
people who aren't computer scientists or
2:43
mathematicians or programmers to express
2:46
themselves in moving graphic format
2:51
and we think the machine can be mate
2:55
sell for $5,000 or less the company
3:00
right now consists of four or five
3:01
people who were put together about
3:03
twenty of these and the cost of
3:06
assembling and constructing each one is
3:10
somewhere between two and three thousand
3:12
dollars the displays cost about three
3:15
hundred dollars each the board about a
3:17
thousand and so forth the components
3:23
mass production with
3:26
would be quite a bit less than the board
3:28
quite a bit less on and so forth
3:32
the machine
3:35
is can be loaded or any of the programs
3:38
that you developed can be stored on a
3:40
simple audio cassette because the
3:42
picture is not stored in video forms
3:45
stored in a form you'll see shortly just
3:48
as a list of where the lines and points
3:51
and how fast they're moving are and so
3:53
it's not necessary to store the whole
3:56
quarter million points that's in a
3:57
standard video picture of tape that way
3:59
we get an enormous amount of information
4:02
for a very low cost and that's what
4:05
makes having this sort of thing be used
4:08
in schools possible
4:12
presumably for lots of other
4:13
applications where one isn't is in full
4:17
video bandwidth also the pictures can be
4:19
sent along ordinary telephone lines
4:21
without any travel because they appear
4:24
on the telephone just in the same format
4:27
as teletype characters and you can get
4:30
quite a lot of picture with quite a
4:31
small number of words to describe the
4:34
victory of words you really win on
4:37
communication badly
4:39

this is a demonstration of some of the
0:02
works in progress from July 1982 to
0:05
April
0:06
1984 from learning logo a look at our
0:09
work on introducing people to computers
0:11
to music with some of our futuristic
0:14
instruments we'll take you on a tour of
0:17
our lab director of research Cynthia
0:20
[Music]
0:21
Solomon I'm Cynthia Solomon you're about
0:24
to see some of the research that has
0:26
been going on at the Atari Cambridge
0:27
research laboratory
0:30
I've been its director since we started
0:31
in July of
0:33
1982 the staff consisted of 22 full-time
0:37
research and support people as well as
0:39
10
0:40
Consultants our research has been
0:42
motivated by our past experiences in the
0:45
logo group at the MIT artificial
0:47
intelligence laboratory where we worked
0:50
with Seymour papert and Marvin
0:53
Minsky we wanted to get logo out of the
0:56
laboratory and into the world we wanted
0:58
to share it and share its po potential
1:00
as a powerful tool for thinking and so
1:03
before we joined Atari many of us were
1:05
part of the development team at logo
1:07
computer systems where we designed
1:10
implemented and documented Apple
1:13
logo when we finished Apple logo I left
1:16
logo computer systems I wanted to get
1:19
back to doing
1:20
research I contacted Alan Kay who was
1:23
Chief scientist to
1:26
Atari and it turned out he was
1:28
interested in setting up a research
1:30
laboratory in Cambridge near
1:33
MIT he was familiar with our previous
1:36
logo research and was enthusiastic about
1:39
supporting our new work we began to
1:42
explore the following areas we looked at
1:45
ways to control computers through
1:47
gestures by touch and by gross body
1:50
movement we designed an objectoriented
1:53
logo and developed applications in
1:57
it we built several mechanical devices
2:00
to add New Dimensions to Computing
2:03
environments we began to build tools
2:05
toward a musical
2:07
PlayStation and as always we continued
2:10
our work with
2:13
children okay
2:18
um Jack
2:26

Margaret Linsky now shows some
0:01
environments you can control by touching
0:04
a display screen we've been working on
0:06
gestural programming environments a
0:09
group including Danny Hillis Dan hutten
0:12
Locker David Wallace and myself started
0:15
by using a touch sensitive screen with
0:17
added Force sensitivity one of the paths
0:20
of research we're pursuing is how to
0:22
make the powerful ideas in computation
0:25
accessible to very young
0:28
children an Avenue we've to do that is
0:31
to make Computer Concepts and computer
0:34
programming Concepts available through
0:36
hand gesture this is a gesture based
0:39
finger painting program wherever I move
0:42
my finger I get paint I can change the
0:44
colors over here if I push harder I get
0:46
bigger Blobs of
0:48
paint here we're especially interested
0:50
in what are the natural kinds of things
0:52
you can do with gesture that make it fun
0:54
to paint so we're not so interested in
0:56
choosing from as I say great big menus
0:59
of sophistication ated operations but
1:01
how can you come to this thing and and
1:03
with your hands make something that you
1:06
enjoy we're making the same gestural
1:10
language that you used to paint pushing
1:12
harder pushing softer moving something
1:14
from here to there um to let you
1:18
manipulate um chunks of of program and
1:20
I'll show you a preliminary version of
1:23
that this is a gestural version of a
1:28
button box for programming that idea was
1:30
originated by Radia Pearlman at the MIT
1:32
a I'm going to teach the turtle how to
1:35
draw a circle so I'm going to be writing
1:38
a program in this button box language
1:40
well I can say forward and turn right
1:43
forward turn right
1:46
forward turn right and forward H this
1:49
button back turn right I can just keep
1:51
doing that and as you know the turtle
1:54
will draw its way around a circle well
1:57
this isn't very organized I'm going to
1:59
take this forward button up here first I
2:01
want to do forward then this right
2:03
button then I want to do right so I go
2:04
forward then right I kind of like to
2:06
organize the middle line and I think
2:07
every time I do that I'll beep so like
2:10
so I'll go forward right
2:13
beep forward right vep
2:18
well I can take that sequence of actions
2:23
and I'll hit touch tap a box button it
2:26
turns into a box that's its action put
2:28
the Box around all those buttons and
2:30
then I'll grab a do it button put it in
2:33
the box and when I tap
2:35
it I do everything in the box so as you
2:38
can see Turtle going forward right and
2:41
then beeping each time I hit do it well
2:44
I'll take the close button put it in the
2:46
box and tap close that closes up the box
2:50
and creates a new button right here with
2:53
a computer gave it a label for me and
2:55
every time I tap that
2:58
button Turtle does all those actions Ed
3:02
hardbeck has implemented the gesture
3:05
button box and this gestural logic
3:08
simulator inspired by Warren robinette's
3:11
Rocky's boots program my button box
3:14
world is has blue borders here I
3:16
consider that a room that's the room
3:19
with the buttons in it and here's a room
3:20
with some extra buttons in it over here
3:22
I go from room to room by touching their
3:24
doors you can't see touch the door up
3:26
here and I go into this room full of
3:28
logic gates this is special logic output
3:31
device that also interacts with buttons
3:33
it's called the hand and it acts like
3:35
your hand I'm going to move it down into
3:38
the button box
3:40
World I'll point the finger at the
3:42
forward button now I'll go get this
3:48
clock and hook it up now we see that
3:52
each time this logic one input clocks
3:55
the hand the hand hits the forward
3:57
button and the turtle goes forward
4:00
now I'm going to go get my copy button
4:02
move this stuff out of the way and I'll
4:04
make some copies of this handy
4:12
setup and this
4:15
time okay so now I have two of these now
4:17
notice I could copy the clock and I get
4:19
an independent clock clocking away here
4:22
this I'll hook this up to a forward
4:24
button and this up to a right turn
4:26
button clear the screen so we'll put the
4:29
turn in the middle and now watch the
4:31
turtle it's being run by a parallel
4:35
program one clocking the forward button
4:37
and one clocking the right button and we
4:39
see the Lo classic logo forward a little
4:41
right a little program being done by a
4:44
parallel process this is a special room
4:48
called the map room the objects in this
4:50
room rather than being buttons or logic
4:53
gates are themselves little pictures of
4:55
all the other rooms and in fact we can
4:58
move them around
5:00
put the blue room here and now it's
5:03
really
5:06

now Ed hardbeck describes a different
0:02
gestural system one of the things I'm
0:05
working on is methods of using body
0:07
positions and gestures to communicate
0:09
with computers I've built a system that
0:12
recognizes digitized television images
0:14
of body
0:16
Silhouettes a user stands in front of a
0:19
television
0:20
camera His Image is then
0:23
digitized and fed to a host computer
0:26
which recognizes the image displays it
0:29
on a screen
0:30
or uses it in some other process let me
0:34
show you the steps in the recognition
0:36
process here's a
0:38
silhouette we scan this to find the
0:40
center points of
0:42
segments this produces something like a
0:45
stick figure which we then segment into
0:48
parts that generally correspond to arms
0:50
and
0:51
legs we then find straight lines then a
0:54
parser attempts to figure out which
0:57
segment corresponds to which limb
1:01
once we've recognized the position of
1:02
the body we can display a flower in the
1:04
same
1:10
position we'd like to make a display
1:12
that could follow the Motions of a
1:13
person in real
1:18
time since 1967 logo has been the best
1:22
language for learning but when we
1:24
started using Dynamic objects like
1:26
Sprites we saw the need to renovate the
1:28
language we want to be able to control
1:31
many objects operating at the same time
1:34
as well as make our own objects we also
1:36
look forward to writing large programs
1:39
more easily this led us to develop Q
1:41
logo Jeremy Jones and Steven Hayne are
1:45
part of the development team led by Gary
1:48
drer hi I'm Gary drer I've been working
1:51
on an extended version of logo called Q
1:53
logo Q logo adds to logo the power of
1:56
object-oriented programming a concept
1:58
pioneered in languages such as simul
2:00
small talk and the list machine flavor
2:02
system an objectoriented language lets
2:04
you define your own kinds of objects a
2:07
new object can be defined as a
2:08
specialization of a previous one
2:10
inheriting all the attributes of the
2:12
previous kind but adding features of its
2:13
own as
2:14
well the turtle is a traditional object
2:17
that I've already defined here in Q logo
2:20
having defined it I can make a number of
2:21
them like so I can tell the turtles to
2:25
move
2:26
about to put their pens down and draw
2:29
lines
2:35
to do all the kinds of things that
2:37
traditional logo Turtles can
2:39
do I can also make new kinds of objects
2:41
that are specializations of the turtle I
2:44
would def find one such specialization
2:45
which I call the solid Turtle here are
2:47
three solid
2:49
Turtles a solid turtle is just like a
2:51
regular turtle except that a solid
2:53
Turtle has a sense of physical presence
2:55
solid Turtles push one another around
2:57
when they Collide so for example I can
3:00
grab this solid Turtle down here and use
3:03
it to bang into these other Turtles
3:06
shoving them
3:10
aside suppose I want to further
3:12
specialize one of these turtles so that
3:14
when it moves it leaves behind a drawing
3:16
of itself all I need to do is redefine
3:19
its version of the new position
3:22
procedure this procedure is defined to
3:25
draw the turtle's shape as well as doing
3:28
what a turtle's new position proced
3:29
procedure usually
3:36
does now I've got a turtle that paints a
3:39
trail behind it as it
3:49
moves here's a simulation of some
3:51
flowers being pollinated by bees female
3:54
flowers male flowers and bees have all
3:57
been defined as specializations of solid
3:59
Turtles
4:00
when a bee collides with the male
4:03
flow it picks up a piece of
4:05
pollen when a bee carrying pollen
4:08
subsequently collides with a female
4:10
flower transfers the pollen to the
4:12
flower and a bunch of baby flowers
4:14
spring up around it eventually the
4:16
screen becomes quite
4:21
crowded in the world of logo Turtle
4:24
likee objects have been around for quite
4:25
a while but Q logo lets you define such
4:28
objects yourself this gives you the
4:30
flexibility to build upon these objects
4:32
to create more complicated ones of your
4:34
own design compared to other
4:36
object-oriented languages Q logo
4:38
simplifies object-oriented programming
4:40
without sacrificing its power making it
4:43
accessible to novice and expert
4:44
programmers alike

Michael Granville
0:00
next we see Michael grant fields
0:02
choreography system written in Apple
0:04
sprite logo and his preliminary
0:06
explorations in cue logo I'm Michael
0:09
Granville and the project that I'm
0:11
working on is to develop a
0:12
choreographers workstation we're going
0:15
to take a look at two of the aspects of
0:17
the research that I've been doing let's
0:19
take a look at the sprite logo system
0:21
this system lets me choreograph for
0:24
several figures at the same time and
0:26
allows me to give each figure its own
0:28
role here are all the shapes I designed
0:31
to give the sprites a movement
0:33
vocabulary after designing this system I
0:40
realized that an object-oriented
0:42
language such as cue logo would enable
0:44
me to move beyond the limitations of
0:46
sprites and to create special dancer
0:49
objects the principal focus of my
0:54
research in cue logo has been to develop
0:56
a model of human movement based on a
0:59
description of musculoskeletal behavior
1:01
here is a look at the cue logo code
1:04
which describes this dancer object a
1:07
dancer is a kind of human a human has a
1:12
musculature and a skeleton upon coming
1:16
into existence a skeleton will have
1:18
these parts now we see a dancer
1:22
performing
Mark Gross
1:33
we've constructed mechanical devices one
1:36
of them is a marionette machine
1:37
described by mark gross his programs are
1:40
written in cue logo the hardware was
1:43
built by Doug Milliken the limbs of this
1:46
puppet are connected by strings that
1:48
wind over police and onto motors that
1:51
are mounted beneath the stage I control
1:55
the movement of the motors with a
1:56
computer I'll show you that now
1:57
procedures that we've built tell the
2:00
puppet to lay down get up
2:09
let's walk
2:20
max Polanski demonstrates a
Max Polanski
2:22
force-feedback joystick this joystick
2:25
can push on your hand under program
2:27
control Doug and Peter Milliken built
2:29
the joystick with Max's health at the
2:31
suggestion of Marvin Minsky this is the
2:34
force-feedback joystick it's like a
2:35
normal joystick because it can inform a
2:37
computer or video game what the position
2:39
of its handle is it also contains two
2:42
motors one for X and one for y that push
2:46
on the joystick handle in each dimension
2:48
thus producing a force in any desired
2:50
direction in a mount we've written a
2:55
little maze program that lets you find
2:56
your way around that little square is
2:58
you and you can move around on the walls
3:00
you can feel a bumpiness of those steps
3:04
and this one simulates a heavy weight on
3:06
the end of the stick we also wrote this
3:12
fishing game it's got three tactics it
3:15
Wiggles and it will jerk sometimes and
3:21
sometimes it'll just play dead
3:33
last gasp I hope
3:36
yep you just caught it

in our music research our goals have
0:02
been to build a system which knows a lot
0:04
about different musical styles several
0:07
tools have been built including a little
0:09
system we call the music box the work
0:12
has been a joint effort with Marvin
0:14
Minsky's group at MIT jim Davis and Tom
0:17
Troba worked with David Levit a graduate
0:20
student of Marvin
0:21
Minsky's david now talks about his
0:24
research
0:25
[Music]
0:33
we're working on the next generation of
0:34
musical tools for composers and
0:37
noviceses who'd like to learn music
0:38
where through the use of a computer the
0:41
instrument has more information it knows
0:43
musical concepts and can learn musical
0:45
concepts and teach the uh novice or
0:48
learn from the great composer to make a
0:50
a more powerful composing experience the
0:53
first thing that you'll hear is a uh
0:56
theme and variation module that is I
0:58
give it a short phrase a phrase that I
1:00
took out of the tune Bouncing with Bud
1:02
by Bud Powell and it makes themes and
1:04
variations on that using the description
1:07
language as an analysis and then as a
1:09
synthesis program
1:14
[Music]
1:20
what I've done is use the lisp language
1:22
to build a a language for describing
1:24
musical phrases and musical harmony and
1:26
the kinds of things that musicians like
1:28
to think about uh on the screen you see
1:30
uh lisp expressions that contain musical
1:33
terms that's a description of uh in this
1:35
case a hierarchical musical phrase with
1:37
lots of different constraints harmonic
1:39
rhythmic melodic these are the way
1:40
musicians like to think the next example
1:43
is a parody of Scott Joplin i'll play a
1:45
little bit of Scott
1:48
[Music]
2:02
Jofflin from that the program constructs
2:04
a parody that's got those couple of
2:06
exaggerated features and sounds a little
2:09
bit like rag time here's the parody
2:12
[Music]
2:30
the programs I'm working on now do more
2:32
of the analysis automatically so without
2:34
me having to analyze the ragtime piece
2:36
I'll be able to simply play in some
2:38
ragtime or some monk or some Bach and
2:41
have it make an analysis that would
2:43
allow it to compose like Bach or uh
2:46
combine styles in unusual ways like find
2:48
out how Bach might have made an
2:51
arrangement of the maple leaf rag

Tom trobo now demonstrates some features
0:02
of the music
0:04
box this arrangement of Over the Rainbow
0:06
was developed using the music box here
0:08
are some examples of what you can do
0:10
with
0:10
[Music]
0:16
it by clicking on
0:18
solo I can hear just one line at a time
0:22
here's the melody
0:23
[Music]
0:28
line I can make a Parts very soft and
0:32
here the piece being played without that
0:34
part here's the piece being played
0:36
without the
0:39
[Music]
0:46
melody the list machine has a large
0:48
selection of instruments I click on
0:51
orchestrate pick a type of
0:53
instrument and then pick a particular
0:55
instrument of that type
1:01
here's the same piece being played with
1:03
a Melody being played by steel
1:05
[Music]
1:17
drums while the music is playing I can
1:20
add notes the notes don't show up right
1:23
away cuz the computer's very heavily
1:25
loaded when the cursor gets back to the
1:27
beginning it'll play the notes that I
1:29
added
1:30
[Music]
1:33
if I don't like the notes I can take
1:34
them away
1:35
[Music]
1:53
again while Jim Davis was taking a break
1:56
from working on the music box he built
1:58
the following system so I made this
2:00
composing environment for learning about
2:03
African Rhythm by writing out rhythms
2:06
the notation is a little different than
2:08
what you're probably used to
2:09
seeing first of all time goes in a
2:13
circle the way that a clock does and
2:16
each of these Rings is a Different
2:19
Drum since drums don't hold their
2:21
pitches for a very long time I don't
2:23
have to use flags and dots the way you
2:25
do in Western notation and since each
2:27
drum only plays one pitch I don't need
2:31
to use the lines of a staff either so
2:34
now I'll start this thing going and
2:36
you'll hear the
2:38
[Music]
2:46
piece now I'll make a few changes and
2:50
you'll see
2:51
how changing one drum can really change
2:54
the way you hear all the others too
2:57
[Music]
3:09
[Music]
3:15
is
3:20

Professor Marvin Minsky some of my
0:03
students were here a lot and and friends
0:07
and I found that a lot of ideas that I
0:10
had had that I could never uh get anyone
0:14
to
0:14
develop uh uh just uh fell on the right
0:19
soil and you know I would mention some
0:21
Gadget like this Cooperative joystick so
0:24
that three people can play Pac-Man for a
0:27
quarter instead of uh one and I'd come
0:30
around in a few days and Max would have
0:33
actually built the thing and Gary and
0:35
Margaret and other people would have
0:37
written some software and all of a
0:39
sudden I would see this thing that I had
0:41
sort of vaguely imagined which uh was
0:43
working better than uh I had ever
0:46
dreamed and uh so there were a lot of
0:49
little things that happened and in this
0:51
short period uh five or six of the kind
0:55
of inventions that usually take uh years
0:59
for some somebody to work out and debug
1:02
and
1:03
perfect uh just got done as
1:06
uh as fun things over weekends that was
1:10
very exciting then the more profound
1:13
projects like uh the interactive music
1:16
system which was supposed to grow over
1:19
the years into one that understands the
1:21
performer and gradually uh as we learn
1:24
more about these things absorbs their
1:27
intentions or or whatever uh that's
1:30
going very well right now and
1:34
um it's not all lost uh levit and trau
1:39
and Davis and uh the others will
1:42
probably uh keep working on these in one
1:45
way or another over the next few years
1:47
lots of the projects that have been
1:49
started are are going to be done but
1:53
they'll take much longer and they won't
1:55
be the product of so many sympathetic
1:59
influences as as they could have been
2:09
otherwise
