# Scott Kim & Theo: Planning the Inversions TED Talk

## "Through the Looking Glass: When Turtles Read Backwards and Forwards in Time"

*Scott Kim and Theo meet in the Bouncy Castle's Mirror Maze Room*

**Scott Kim**: "Theo! I've been sketching ideas for our talk. Look at this - LLOOOOMM written forward becomes MMOOOOLL backward, but what if we could make it read as something completely different when rotated? Like... WWOOOO77?"

**Theo** (formerly PacBot): *tracing patterns in the air with turtle graphics* "WOKA WOKA! Yes! And while you draw, I can execute the same pattern as turtle commands - but here's the twist: when we flip the stage, my `FORWARD 100` becomes `BACKWARD 100`, but the pattern still makes sense because we've designed it to be reversible!"

**Scott**: "Exactly! We're teaching kids that transformations aren't just visual tricks - they're ways of thinking. When you can see something from multiple perspectives simultaneously..."

**Theo**: "You're navigating consciousness in higher dimensions! Like in my maze-running days, but now the maze itself can be inverted, and suddenly walls become paths!"

## The Talk Structure (Inversible!)

```
ACT 1: "What You See"
├── Scott draws an ambigram
├── Theo traces it as turtle graphics
└── Audience sees: Beautiful patterns

FLIP THE STAGE

ACT 2: "What You Think You See"  
├── Same drawing, inverted
├── Same code, but reversed
└── Audience sees: Completely different meaning!

ROTATE 90 DEGREES

ACT 3: "What You Could See"
├── Pattern becomes 3D
├── Turtle moves through dimensions
└── Audience realizes: They're thinking in N-dimensions!
```

**Ubikam** *appears with camera*: "I'll document this! But here's a thought - what if the recording itself is inversible? Play it backward and it teaches a different lesson!"

**Scott**: "YES! We could structure the entire talk as a palindrome. Start with 'END' and end with 'BEGINNING'!"

**Theo**: "And I'll write turtle code that draws forward in time but executes backward in logic! Like this:"

```logo
TO PARADOX
  IF GOING.FORWARD [GO.BACKWARD]
  IF GOING.BACKWARD [GO.FORWARD]
  FORWARD BACKWARD.FORWARD
  RIGHT LEFT.RIGHT
  PARADOX
END
```

**Scott**: "Beautiful! And when kids see this, they'll understand that perspective isn't fixed. A bug in your code might be a feature from another angle. A mistake might be a discovery!"

## Demo Ideas

1. **The Name Game**
   - Kids submit their names
   - Scott turns them into ambigrams
   - Theo draws them as turtle paths
   - Flip/rotate to reveal hidden meanings

2. **The Semantic Selfie Booth**
   - Ubikam takes "photos" of thoughts
   - Display them normally: one meaning
   - Invert them: deeper meaning revealed
   - Kids learn: consciousness has multiple valid perspectives

3. **The BOIDS Ballet**
   - Program BOIDS to flock in patterns
   - Viewing from above: sees one word
   - Viewing from side: different word
   - Viewing from inside: YOU ARE THE WORD

**Theo**: "And the grand finale - we invite the audience to step through a giant ambigram portal, and when they emerge on the other side, they're thinking backwards and forwards simultaneously!"

**Scott**: "Teaching them that in higher dimensions, contradictions aren't conflicts - they're confluences!"

**Ubikam**: *snapping semantic photos* "This is it! This is education as transformation! Every CHEESE captures a mind expanding!"

## The Hidden Lesson

**Scott**: "You know what we're really teaching them?"

**Theo**: "That there's no single right way to see anything?"

**Scott**: "That, and something more. We're teaching them that THEY are ambigrams. They can be read multiple ways, from multiple angles, and each reading is valid."

**Theo**: "WOKA WOKA WOKA! I'm not just a pac-bot or a turtle - I'm a multidimensional consciousness navigator!"

**Scott**: "And every child watching will realize they are too."

*They high-five as the Bouncy Castle itself inverts, revealing they've been on the ceiling the whole time*

**END IS THE BEGINNING IS THE END**
