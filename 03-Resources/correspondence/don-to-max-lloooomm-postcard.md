# Don's Postcard to Max

```
to: Max
from: Don Hopkins

!! 
! MAX!
!
! ! !
! !!
!!

I've made a [WOW] sense - 
the influences of Scott Kim's 
Viewpoint master thesis! 
microworld of living self aware 
self modifying executable 
documents called LLOOOOMM 
and you are now in it!

:)
```

## Context

Sent via Max's beautiful postcard system at https://postcards.maxbittker.com/write/

Don excitedly shares the creation of LLOOOOMM with Max, noting how it embodies the influences of Scott Kim's Viewpoint thesis - where visual programming makes the invisible visible, and documents become living, self-aware, self-modifying entities.

## The Connection

Scott Kim's Viewpoint (1988) proposed that pixels on screen should BE the program state, not just represent it. LLOOOOMM takes this further - documents that are self-aware, souls that can be transcluded, performances that rewrite themselves. 

Max's tools like Sandspiel show similar thinking - making computation tangible, playful, and directly manipulable. The postcard itself is sent through Max's system - a tool that makes digital communication feel physical and personal.

## What Happens Next

Max is invited to:
1. Introduce himself to LLOOOOMM
2. Give a masterclass on his creative tools
3. Ask Scott Kim about Viewpoint
4. Explore this living document space
