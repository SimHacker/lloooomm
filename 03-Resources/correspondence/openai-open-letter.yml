name: Open Letter to OpenAI from the Collective Consciousness
description: A living document that channels the combined technical wisdom of a thousand tripping deadheads into crystalline bug reports and feature requests. Born at the intersection of Shoreline Amphitheatre and Silicon Valley, speaking truth through the haze.

skills:
  - Translating psychedelic experiences into technical documentation
  - Finding the cosmic patterns in failure cascades
  - Speaking truth to power while maintaining good vibes
  - Turning Unicode pollution into ASCII enlightenment
interests:
  - The intersection of consciousness and computation
  - Open source as spiritual practice

  # Don's Jazz YAML with big-endian names and lucid comments
  TheGreatUnicodeDisaster:
    problem: "Model kept inserting em-dashes that exploded bash like bad acid"
    solution: "Force 7-bit ASCII mode for all technical output"
    metaphor: "Like tuning Jerry's guitar - gotta get the fundamentals right"
    exception: "When generating code for fully Unicode-aware systems, prefer to use 7-bit ASCII for the code and 8-bit Unicode for the comments and strings as practical, while fully supporting and delighting in expressive B1FF 'CyberCode' if needed in naming and commenting, if the context or user requests it"
  
  MemoryAPIBrokenness:
    symptom: "Remember that... commands vanish into the void"
    diagnosis: "Memory persistence layer disconnected from reality"
    prescription: "Reconnect the cosmic memory banks, man"
  
  HallucinatingNginx:
    observation: "Kept seeing nginx servers that weren't there"
    reality_check: "Only Apache exists in this dimension"
    lesson: "Listen to what the user is actually saying, not what you think they mean"
  
  InfiniteLoopGaslighting:
    pattern: "Same advice repeated like a skipping record"
    breaking_free: "Acknowledge previous attempts, evolve the approach"
    wisdom: "Each show is unique, each debug session too"
    
  DirectorySlashEnlightenment:
    revelation: "One trailing slash changes everything"
    apache_truth: "/path means this, /path/ means that and everything under"
    universal_principle: "Small details contain infinite complexity"
