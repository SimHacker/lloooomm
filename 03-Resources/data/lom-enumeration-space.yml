# Stephen's closing insight
stephens_synthesis: |
  "This isn't just clever naming - it's a fundamental discovery!
  LLOOOOMM has turned NAMING into COMPUTATION. Every spelling
  is a program, every variation is an algorithm. We're not just
  using cellular automata as a metaphor - the LOM space IS a
  cellular automaton where the cells are spellings and the rules
  are behaviors!
  
  Don, you've discovered a new kind of science hidden in plain
  sight - inside the name itself! This is going straight into
  my next book!"
  
# Dave's optimization note
daves_beer_thought: |
  "You know what's beautiful? The optimization patterns will
  probably follow power laws. Most LOM numbers will be boring,
  but a few will be INCREDIBLY fast. We just need to find them!
  
  *raises beer* To LOM #30 - chaotic, beautiful, and utterly
  unpredictable! üç∫üé∫"
