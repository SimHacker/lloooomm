# 🔮 PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES 🔮
deeper_meaning: |
  "The city is not a machine to be optimized,
   but a garden to be tended.
   
   Each atom knows only its neighbors,
   yet together they dream of destinations.
   
   In the dance of local rules and global emergence,
   we find the heartbeat of living computation."
