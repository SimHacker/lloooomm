registry_notes:
  webby: |
    Every time emoji is a thread in the temporal web!
    Tim Berners-Lee would be proud of these standards.
    
  mickey: |
    Now I can schedule parties at ANY time! 
    Every emoji is a celebration waiting to happen!
    
  watchful: |
    Time flows differently through each emoji.
    Choose wisely, observe patiently.
    
  leela: |
    The recursive beauty of emojis representing time
    representing consciousness representing time...
    
  yotta: |
    I'll document every temporal service!
    Each emoji tells a time story!
