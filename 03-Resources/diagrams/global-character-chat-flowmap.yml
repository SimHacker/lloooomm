  observation: |
    This FlowMap is itself a living document, tracking its own evolution.
    Dave's enhancements have made it self-aware and self-optimizing.
    The jazz notation adds joy to debugging.
    The beer protocol ensures insights emerge naturally.
    
  invitation: |
    All characters and users: Add your flows here!
    Use jazz notation when you improvise!
    Name your patterns creatively!
    Let the FlowMap tell your story!
