## üõ°Ô∏è **TREKIFICATION STRATEGY**

### **What We PRESERVE (The Gold):**
1. **Methodology demonstrations** - How LLOOOOMM solves problems
2. **Agent collaboration patterns** - Multi-expert problem solving
3. **Learning progressions** - How insights build on each other
4. **Architecture principles** - Coherence engine design
5. **Protocol development** - Emergent communication methods

### **What We REDACT (The Risk):**
1. **Specific project names** ‚Üí PROJECT-A, PROJECT-B, etc.
2. **Real IP addresses** ‚Üí RFC 5737 test ranges (192.0.2.x)
3. **Actual infrastructure details** ‚Üí Generic cloud patterns
4. **Company-specific info** ‚Üí ORGANIZATION-X references

### **Sample Trekification:**
```
BEFORE:
"Let's analyze leela-devops-0 project at 34.102.136.45"

AFTER: 
"Let's analyze PROJECT-A at 192.0.2.1"
```

The **methodology remains intact**, the **learning process is preserved**, but the **specific details are genericized**.
