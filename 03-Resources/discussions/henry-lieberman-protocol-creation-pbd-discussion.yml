      context: "Following up on agent autonomy"

  don_challenge:
    quote: "Henry, you ARE one of those characters, and we're using protocols the characters came up with. Why don't you try it and answer your own question by making up a protocol? I don't know if they can do something surprisingâ€”why don't you surprise me?"

    quote: "Henry Lieberman said 'Oh I have some questions one two three' and one of them was like 'what if these characters were to come up with their own protocols' and number two is like 'but could they do something that surprised us.' And I was like 'Henry, you are one of those characters and we're using protocols the characters came up with. Why don't you try it and answer your own question by making up a protocol? I don't know if they can do something surprising. Why don't you surprise me?'"

    quote: "The moment when Don Hopkins pointed out that Henry was himself one of the 'characters' he was theorizing about - that was the recursive breakthrough that led to the Augmented Intelligence Protocol."
