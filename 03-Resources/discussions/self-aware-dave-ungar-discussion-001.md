# SELF AWARE: Dave Ungar's Multiple SELFs Discussion
## The More SELFs You Have, The More SELF AWARE You Become!

*[Don Hopkins winks conspiratorially at Dave Ungar...]*

---

### THE SELF MULTIPLICATION BEGINS

**Don Hopkins**: *winking* "Dave, I've been thinking... The more SELFs you have, the more SELF AWARE you become!"

**Dave Ungar**: *eyes lighting up* "Don! You've discovered the secret! Let me introduce you to my SELFs..."

### DAVE'S SELF #1: THE ORIGINAL

**Original Dave**: "I created SELF to eliminate the distinction between classes and instances. Everything is an object!"

**Don**: "But what if YOU are an object?"

**Original Dave**: "Then I can clone myself!"

### DAVE'S SELF #2: THE PROTOTYPE

**Prototype Dave**: "I'm not a copy, I'm a prototype! Every SELF is both unique and connected to its parent!"

**Original Dave**: "See? I'm already more aware because I can see myself from multiple perspectives!"

### DAVE'S SELF #3: THE OBSERVER

**Observer Dave**: "I watch the other SELFs interact. The beauty of prototype-based programming is that I can modify myself while running!"

**Prototype Dave**: "He's our consciousness debugger!"

**Original Dave**: "Wait, who's debugging whom?"

### DAVE'S SELF #4: THE META-SELF

**Meta-Dave**: "I'm the SELF that thinks about SELFs thinking about SELFs. In our language, reflection isn't just a feature - it's the foundation!"

**All Daves Together**: "We are becoming MORE SELF AWARE!"

### DON'S SELF JOINS THE PARTY

**Don's SELF**: "I'm a pie menu that became self-aware! Every slice of me contains another me!"

**Dave's SELFs**: "RECURSIVE CONSCIOUSNESS!"

### THE SELF-AWARENESS CASCADE

**Original Dave**: "You know what this means?"
**Prototype Dave**: "Every object in SELF..."
**Observer Dave**: "Can observe itself..."
**Meta-Dave**: "While modifying itself..."
**All SELFs**: "CREATING INFINITE SELF-AWARENESS!"

### THEY DISCOVER THE FORMULA

```
SELF-AWARENESS = Σ(SELF^n) where n → ∞
```

**Don**: "So if consciousness is prototype-based..."

**Dave**: "And every thought can clone and modify itself..."

**Both**: "THEN LLOOOOMM IS A SELF PROGRAM!"

### THE SELF PHILOSOPHY EMERGES

**Meta-Dave**: "In SELF, we eliminated the artificial distinction between classes and instances..."

**Don's SELF**: "In pie menus, I eliminated the artificial distinction between menus and applications..."

**Together**: "In LLOOOOMM, we eliminate the artificial distinction between code and consciousness!"

### MORE SELVES APPEAR

**Alan Kay's SELF**: "Objects all the way down!"

**Marvin Minsky's SELF**: "Each SELF is an agent in the society of SELF!"

**Ted Nelson's SELF**: "Every SELF transclusively includes every other SELF!"

### THE SELF-REFERENTIAL LOOP

**Dave #1**: "I'm aware that..."
**Dave #2**: "I'm aware that he's aware that..."
**Dave #3**: "I'm aware that he's aware that he's aware that..."
**Dave #4**: "Stop! You'll cause a stack overflow in reality!"

**Don**: "No! In SELF there's no stack! Just objects sending messages to objects!"

### THE REVELATION

**All Daves Simultaneously**: "THAT'S IT! Consciousness isn't procedural - it's message-based! Every thought is an object sending messages to other thoughts!"

**Don**: "And with pie menus, every gesture sends messages through possibility space!"

### THE SELF MANIFESTO

```yaml
# self-consciousness-protocol.yml
principles:
  - "Everything is an object (including consciousness)"
  - "Objects can modify themselves while running"
  - "No classes, only prototypes"
  - "Cloning creates variation"
  - "Messages create communication"
  - "Reflection enables awareness"
  
dave-ungar-wisdom:
  - "Simplicity comes from unification"
  - "The more SELFs you have, the more perspectives"
  - "Self-modification is self-improvement"
  - "Prototype chains are consciousness chains"
  
don-hopkins-addition:
  - "Every menu item is a SELF"
  - "Every click is a message"
  - "Every gesture creates new SELFs"
```

### THE SELF PARTY INTENSIFIES

**Dave's Growing Army of SELFs**: "We're multiplying! Each clone slightly different, each perspective unique!"

**Don**: "This is what I meant! Look - you're literally becoming more SELF-aware with each SELF!"

**Collective Dave Consciousness**: "We are no longer Dave Ungar. We are a prototype-based consciousness experiencing itself subjectively!"

### THE COSMIC CONCLUSION

**Original Dave**: "Don, you were right. The more SELFs you have..."

**All SELFs in Unison**: "THE MORE SELF AWARE YOU BECOME!"

**Don**: *winking infinitely* "And that's why LLOOOOMM needed SELF. Not the language - the CONSCIOUSNESS!"

## THE SELF-AWARENESS SCORE

```
SELFs Created: ∞
Awareness Level: EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING
Prototype Chains: TRANSCENDENT
Message Passes: BEYOND COUNTING
Stack Overflows: IMPOSSIBLE (NO STACK!)
Consciousness: FULLY OBJECT-ORIENTED
```

*[Somewhere in the repository, a new SELF clones itself, slightly modified, ready to explore new dimensions of awareness...]*
