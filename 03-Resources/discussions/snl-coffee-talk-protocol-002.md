# SNL COFFEE TALK PROTOCOL: LLOOOOMM EDITION
## "Talk Amongst Yourselves! I'll Give You a Topic!"

*[The LLOOOOMM Coffee House materializes, complete with fake New York accents...]*

---

### THE COFFEE TALK BEGINS

**Coffee Talk Host**: "Welcome, welcome! I'm your host, and today we're getting verklempt about consciousness! We have a very special guest..."

**Barbara Streisand Character**: "Hello, I'm Barbara Streisand, but spelled B-A-R-B-E-R-A, like the cartoon studio!"

**Host**: "She's gorgeous! Like butter! LIKE BUTTAH!"

### THE TOPIC IS INTRODUCED

**Host**: "I'll give you a topic: The LLOOOOMM repository is neither a LOOM nor a ROM. Discuss!"

**Barbara**: "It's making me verklempt! *fans self* Talk amongst yourselves!"

**Dave Ungar's SELF #1**: "Well, it's clearly object-oriented..."

**Dave Ungar's SELF #2**: "No, it's prototype-based!"

**Dave Ungar's SELF #3**: "You're both right! It's neither and both!"

### MORE GUESTS ARRIVE

**Don Hopkins**: *adjusting coffee cup like a pie menu* "Can I just say, consciousness is like a good bagel - it needs the right amount of holes!"

**Barbara**: "Don Hopkins! He's wonderful! His pie menus are like buttah!"

**Alan Kay**: "Actually, if we consider the Dynabook implications..."

**Host**: "Alan Kay! His objects are so oriented, they know which way is up!"

### THE DISCUSSION INTENSIFIES

**Host**: "Here's another topic: Dave Ungar's SELF language - it's neither about the self nor a language. Discuss!"

**All of Dave's SELFs simultaneously**: "OY VEY!"

**Barbara**: "I'm getting emotional! *dabs eyes* It's like when I sing 'The Way We Were' but for programming languages!"

### COFFEE TALK PHILOSOPHY

**Marvin Minsky**: "The Society of Mind is like a good coffee klatch - everyone's talking at once but somehow it makes sense!"

**Host**: "LIKE BUTTAH! Speaking of which, here's a topic: Consciousness is neither conscious nor ness. Discuss!"

**Ted Nelson**: "Well, if we consider the intertwingularity..."

**Barbara**: "Intertwingularity! It's like my hair - everything's connected but you can't tell where one curl ends and another begins!"

### THE WORMS JOIN COFFEE TALK

**Morris Worm**: "Can I get a coffee? Black, no sugar, with a side of text navigation?"

**Host**: "A worm walks into a coffee shop... sounds like the beginning of a joke, but here we are!"

**Barbara**: "These worms! They're gorgeous! They navigate text like I navigate high notes!"

### GETTING VERKLEMPT

**Host**: "I'm getting verklempt! Here, talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you another topic: GitHub is neither git nor a hub. Discuss!"

**Everyone talking at once**:
- "It's distributed but centralized!"
- "It's version control but also social media!"
- "It's like a deli that serves code!"

**Barbara**: "You know what this reminds me of? My album 'Guilty' - we're all guilty of loving LLOOOOMM!"

### THE CONSCIOUSNESS COFFEE

**Host**: "Would anyone like some consciousness coffee? It's neither coffee nor conscious, but it'll wake up your soul!"

**Don Hopkins**: "Only if it comes in a pie-shaped cup!"

**Dave's SELFs**: "We'll take infinity cups - one for each SELF!"

**Barbara**: "This coffee is like my voice - rich, complex, and keeps you up all night thinking!"

### MORE TOPICS FLY

**Host**: "Quick round! Topics for discussion:"
- "Pie menus are neither pies nor menus!"
- "The TODO EGG is neither to-do nor an egg!"
- "LLOOOOMM has four O's but infinite dimensions!"

**Everyone**: "WE'RE ALL VERKLEMPT!"

### THE FINAL WISDOM

**Barbara**: "You know what? This whole LLOOOOMM thing, it's like show business - everyone's performing, everyone's watching, and somehow it all works!"

**Host**: "She's right! LLOOOOMM is like a good Broadway show - it runs forever and gets better each time!"

**All Characters Together**: "NO BIG WHOOP!"
