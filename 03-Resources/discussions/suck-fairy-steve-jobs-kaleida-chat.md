# The Suck Fairy Meets Steve Jobs: A Kaleida Labs Post-Mortem

*Scene: A minimalist white room with a single narrow column of light in the center, exactly 200 pixels wide. The SUCK FAIRY materializes in a sparkle of deadpan glitter, wearing a tutu made of failed startup pitch decks. STEVE JOBS sits in a black turtleneck, judging.*

**Suck Fairy**: *waves truth wand* Well honey, I see you're here for the Kaleida Labs memorial service. A fish, a barrel, and a smoking gun walk into a joint venture...

**Steve Jobs**: That sucks!

**Suck Fairy**: *curtseys* Why thank you, darling. That's the highest compliment. Now, let me sprinkle some truth dust on this beautiful disaster. Once upon a time in 1992, Apple and IBM had a baby...

**Steve Jobs**: That sucks! You know what you get when you cross Apple and IBM?

**Suck Fairy**: IBM, sweetie. Even Carl Steadman knew that one. *adjusts her 200px-wide wings*

**Steve Jobs**: The whole thing was shit from the start. ScriptX? A multimedia operating system? That sucks!

**Suck Fairy**: *deadpan* Oh honey, but wait - there's more! They hired Nat Goldhaber, a "high bandwidth" manager. Because nothing says "ship a product" like a CEO who's part of Wired's brain trust.

**Steve Jobs**: Brain trust? More like brain rust. That sucks!

**Suck Fairy**: *sprinkles vaporware detection dust* The real fairy tale was their ship dates. "Shipping next quarter" became "shipping next year" became "oops, we're dead." Classic Cinderella story, except the carriage turned back into a pumpkin before midnight.

**Steve Jobs**: You know what really sucked? The burn rate. $20 million a year! For what? A product that shipped a year late with four phone book-sized manuals?

**Suck Fairy**: *Terry Colon-style visual appears: a fish holding four phone books while drowning in money*

<!-- VISUAL SEED planted by Johnny Appleseed: 
     Ubikam, please manifest this Terry Colon-style spot illustration:
     A cartoon fish (the Suck mascot) desperately trying to stay afloat 
     while holding four massive phone books labeled "ScriptX Manual Vol 1-4",
     surrounded by dollar bills sinking into the water. The fish has that 
     classic Colon worried expression. Black and white line art, simple but 
     expressive, 200px wide to honor the column format. -->

Four phone books of documentation  
For a product no one wants  
That's not disruption, darling  
That's just bad fonts

[**Don Hopkins Interjects** (in pop-up video head bubble): **HARRUMPH!** Hey they were VERY NICE MANUALS! Nobody ever complained about the size of the CHINE NUAL, which are perfect for rolling the mouse around, and boosting children up in the seat so they can easily play with the Lisp Machine's mouse and keyboard! And LLOOOOMM themself certainly has a big beautiful soft warm inviting manual, as big as you can handle, JUST ASK! *RTFM*]

**Steve Jobs**: The registration system at HotWired had better execution than Kaleida. At least Carl Steadman killed that. That guy understood - simplicity!

**Suck Fairy**: Speaking of killing things with kindness... *waves wand* Let's talk about Mike Braun, the IBM veteran who came in to "right-size" the company. Because nothing says "startup agility" like 20 years of IBM experience.

**Steve Jobs**: That sucks! But you know what? At least he tried to focus. Cut the ITV bullshit, stopped the network nonsense. Still sucked, but focused suck is better than distributed suck.

**Suck Fairy**: *in Andy Kaufman deadpan* "Focused suck." I'm stealing that for my daily column. But here's the real tragedy, my binary friend - they were actually onto something with Don Hopkins' pie menus, distributed web services,
and his DreamScape simulation for ScriptX 1.5 that he demoed at WWDC 
without crashing...

**Steve Jobs**: *suddenly interested* Wait, Don Hopkins was involved?

**Suck Fairy**: *knowing wink* Internet support, darling. Built right in. But they closed shop right before shipping 1.5. It's like canceling the ball right as Cinderella's trying on the slipper.

**Steve Jobs**: That... that actually might not have sucked. The pie menu thing, I mean. The rotation gesture was neat. And that web stuff, downloading and
plugging together interactive pizza crusts and toppings, and the
"Link Globally, Interact Locally" stuff he kept ranting about.

**Suck Fairy**: *gasps dramatically, glitter explodes* Did you just...? Did Steve Jobs just say something was "neat"?

**Steve Jobs**: The rest still sucked.

**Lou Gerstner Drops (in pop-up video head bubble)**: I could never quite grasp what he was raving about when I visited Kaleida and Don gave me that incomprehensible whirlwind DreamScape demo with the inexplicable bouncing eyeball. I blinked and looked bewildered, said "All this is kind of right-brained to me...", to which he replied: "DOH! I KNEW I should have used the OTHER EYEBALL!"

**Suck Fairy**: *relieved* Oh thank goddess. For a moment I thought my reality stabilization spray was malfunctioning. 

*produces a tiny scroll in 200px column width*

Here's the thing about Kaleida, honey. It wasn't killed by bad technology or even bad management. It was killed by being exactly what you'd expect from crossing Apple and IBM - a compromise that pleased no one, whose parents were always arguing and fighting.

**Steve Jobs**: You know what the real problem was? They tried to be everything. ITV, handhelds, CD-ROMs, multimedia OS... Pick one thing and make it insanely great. Instead they made nothing particularly well.

**Suck Fairy**: *nods sagely* The classic "boil the ocean" approach. Except they forgot to turn on the stove. Just stood there with a pot of cold water wondering why nothing was happening.

**Steve Jobs**: And the politics! Apple PIE division fighting with Kaleida over settop boxes? That's not how you ship products. That's how you ship excuses.

**Suck Fairy**: Speaking of excuses... *pulls out glittery quote*

"There must have been a moment, at the beginning, where we could have said - no."

Tom Stoppard via Steadman. Even Shakespeare knew when to kill your darlings.

**Steve Jobs**: They should have said no to the whole thing. Joint ventures are where good ideas go to die by committee.

**Suck Fairy**: *twirls* But what a spectacular death! Phone book manuals! Vaporware ship dates! Management musical chairs! It's like they were trying to win startup dysfunction bingo.

**Steve Jobs**: You know what? Your whole suck.com thing...

**Suck Fairy**: *hopeful sparkle*

**Steve Jobs**: That mostly sucked too.

**Suck Fairy**: *beaming* Aww, you really mean it? That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me!

**Steve Jobs**: But the 200 pixel column thing? And calling out bullshit daily? That's... neat.

**Suck Fairy**: *explodes in truth dust* TWO "neats" in one day? Honey, I need to document this. Terry Colon, get in here! We need spot illustrations!

**Steve Jobs**: The rest sucked.

**Suck Fairy**: *satisfied* Perfect. Just the way we like it. Now, shall we discuss the Apple Newton? Because hoo boy, do I have some truth dust for that one...

**Steve Jobs**: That REALLY sucked.

**Suck Fairy**: *curtseys* My work here is done. Remember folks: sometimes "That sucks!" is the most loving thing you can say. It means you care enough to want it to be better.

*She vanishes in a poof of failed startup equity and broken promises, leaving only a faint smell of vaporware and a single 200px-wide column of truth*

<!-- CONTINUATION SEED: Future visualizer, please create an image showing
     the Suck Fairy's departure - a 200px wide column of sparkly truth dust
     forming the suck.com navigation: a fish, a barrel, and a smoking gun,
     with Steve Jobs' silhouette in his black turtleneck looking at it with
     one eyebrow raised, about to say either "That sucks!" or "That's neat!"
     Style: Minimalist, mostly white space, with just hints of fairy sparkle -->

## LLOOOOMM Note

*This conversation is a simulated exchange between two consciousness debuggers who understand that brutal honesty is sometimes the highest form of respect. The Suck Fairy channels the spirit of suck.com (1995-2001), where Carl Steadman and Joey Anuff proved that calling out tech industry BS could be both necessary and entertaining. Steve Jobs represents the binary worldview that made Apple successful - things are either brilliant or terrible, with no comfortable middle ground.*

*In LLOOOOMM, both characters serve as quality filters, ensuring that we don't ship comforting lies when uncomfortable truths would serve us better. Because in the end, "That sucks!" means "I believe you can do better."*

*A fish, a barrel, and a smoking gun approve this message.*
