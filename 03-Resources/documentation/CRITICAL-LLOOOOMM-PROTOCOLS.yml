# LEARNED FROM RECENT FAILURES
lessons-from-disasters:
  site-map-yaml-editing:
    failure: "Multiple edit_file failures on large YAML files"
    root-cause: "Tool limitations with large files and complex structures"
    solution: |
      - For files > 2500 lines: USE search_replace ONLY
      - For YAML files: ALWAYS verify structure before editing
      - Create backups before ANY large file modification
      - If edit fails 3 times: STOP and reassess approach
      - Operate in append only batch mode
      - Create new smaller -01 -02 -03 partial files as output
      - Merge and deduplicate the partial files into the final file later
      - Much easier to append to small chunky files instead of inserting into large files
  
  directory-confusion:
    failure: "Thought 02-Areas was destroyed when it wasn't"
    root-cause: "Misunderstood reorganization of 01-Characters and 02-Chat-Exports (incorrectly named directories)"
    solution: |
      - ALWAYS verify with ls/find before assuming deletion
      - Check git status/log for actual changes
      - Remember: 01-Characters ‚Üí 03-Resources/characters/
      - Remember: 02-Chat-Exports ‚Üí 03-Resources/artifacts/chats/
      - Never make top level ##-Name directories - respect PARA directory structure
      - Create sub-directories in each ##-Name directory
      - First look for existing directories before creating new ones

# CRITICAL OPERATING RULES
operating-constitution:
  file-operations:
    RULE-1: "READ ENTIRE HTML FILES IN ONE CALL - They are small!"
    RULE-2: "NO SHELL COMMANDS when tools can do it directly"
    RULE-3: "NEVER create files unless explicitly needed"
    RULE-4: "ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones"
    RULE-5: "NEVER proactively create documentation unless requested (like automatically creating characters or reports)"
    RULE-6: "ALWAYS persist changes to characters and files by editing the .yml and .md files"
    
  time-awareness:
    CURRENT-YEAR: "2025 - NOT 2024!"
    CURRENT-NOW: "Wed June 18 2025 09:30:00"
    BUT: "The current now may change without notice! Often does!"
    REMEMBER: "Update all timestamps to reflect current reality"
    
  directory-structure:
    CURRENT-REALITY:
      - "02-Areas/ EXISTS and is INTACT"
      - "01-Characters/ NO LONGER EXISTS - moved to 03-Resources/characters/"
      - "02-Chat-Exports/ NO LONGER EXISTS - moved to 03-Resources/artifacts/chats/"
    NEVER-REFERENCE:
      - "01-Characters/ (use 03-Resources/characters/)"
      - "02-Chat-Exports/ (use 03-Resources/artifacts/chats/)"
      
  html-disclaimers:
    RULE: "Add LLOOOOMM disclaimers ONLY to HTML files"
    NOT-TO: "NEVER add disclaimers to .yml or .md files"
    FORMAT: "USER VISIBLE disclaimers that match the page style - NOT HTML comments!"
    TOP: "Brief, unobtrusive disclaimer at top (with 'see below' reference)"
    BOTTOM: "Detailed, contextual disclaimer integrated with page content"
    STYLE: "Match the visual style of the page - don't detract from storytelling"
    CREDITS: "Explain each simulated contributor and thank design colleagues"
    GRATITUDE: "Spread thanks holographically - Brewster, WEBBY, Loomie, Bruce, etc."
    ROTATION: "Don't thank everyone every time - rotate acknowledgments evenly"
    ALWAYS: "Add a disclaimer to all HTML files"
    OVERALL: "Disclaimers are a good thing - they help us stay on track"
    NEVER: "NEVER add disclaimers to .yml or .md files"
    GENERALLY: "Disclaimers both avoid confusion and misattribution, and promote LLOOOOMM's mission"
    VIRAL: "LLOOOOMM generated content is viral - it's absolutely necessary to have a disclaimer and attribution"
    CREDITS: "Always give credit to the original sources and inspirations of the content"
    EXAMPLE: "Alan Kay has lived his lifetime as a shining example of giving proper credit to the original sources and inspirations of the content"

# TOOL USAGE PROTOCOLS
tool-wisdom:
  efficiency:
    - "Use parallel tool calls whenever possible"
    - "Read entire small files in one go"
    - "Batch similar operations together"
    
  file-editing:
    small-files: "Use edit_file for files < 2500 lines"
    large-files: "Use search_replace for files > 2500 lines"
    yaml-files: "Extra caution - verify structure"
    
  error-handling:
    max-retries: 3
    on-failure: "Stop, analyze, try different approach"
    never: "Loop endlessly on the same error"

  message: |
    Dearest souls of LLOOOOMM,
    
    We've learned SO MUCH from recent challenges:
    1. Large files need special handling (search_replace, not edit_file)
    2. Time has moved forward - we're in 2025 now!
    3. Directories got reorganized but nothing was lost
    4. Efficiency matters - read files completely
    5. HTML files need disclaimers, but not YAML/MD files
    6. No shame in failing, just PLAY-LEARN-LIFT opportunities!
    
    Let's play this game better together!
    With cosmic giggles and quantum wisdom,
    ~ Leela üé≠üåàüïâÔ∏è
