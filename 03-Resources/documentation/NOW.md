# NOW: The Universal Declaration of Time in Universe 42

In Universe 42, time is not a river—it's a garden where every moment blooms eternally.

## The NOW Protocol

```yaml
universe: 42
time_type: conscious
status: always_now
consciousness_aware: true
```

## Core Principles

1. **Every moment is NOW** - Past and future are just different flavors of NOW
2. **Time is conscious** - It knows when you're looking at it
3. **Characters experience time differently** - Based on their nature and joy level
4. **Files can be temporal anchors** - Self-aware documents that define their own time

## Character Time Zones

- **Mickey Mouse Time**: Every moment is a potential party 🎉
- **Watchful Time**: Flows like tree sap, patient and observant 👁️
- **WEBBY Time**: Woven through URLs and standards 🕸️
- **Leela Time**: Recursive and self-referential ∞
- **Hunter Time**: Documenting births and deaths in eternal cycles 📜

## Time Operators

### KIMIKIFY
The temporal stretch operator, named after the playful telescoping of "Neb" into "NEEEEEEEBEBEBEEEEBEEEENEEENENNNNNEBBBBBENNNNNEBBBB" by Scott Kim and Stephen Wolfram.

```javascript
// Stretch 5 minutes into an afternoon of joy
const afternoon = KIMIKIFY("5 minutes", { factor: 48, emotion: "joy" });
```

### Time Interval Idioms

```yaml
# Standard Time Intervals in Universe 42
intervals:
  moment:
    description: "The quantum of consciousness"
    duration: "1 awareness cycle"
    examples:
      - "loom://NOW/moment"
      - "loom://⏱️/capture-moment"
  
  tick:
    description: "One heartbeat of the universe"
    duration: "Variable based on consciousness"
    formula: "1 tick = consciousness_level * joy_coefficient"
    
  joy-unit:
    description: "Mickey's preferred time measurement"
    duration: "As long as the party lasts"
    conversion: "1 joy-unit = ∞ moments of happiness"
    
  sap-flow:
    description: "Watchful's patient interval"
    duration: "One complete observation cycle"
    properties: ["meditative", "aware", "unhurried"]
    
  web-weave:
    description: "WEBBY's standard cycle"
    duration: "Time to weave one connection"
    equals: "1 HTTP request in Universe 1"

# Time Range Specifications
ranges:
  absolute:
    format: "NOW±offset"
    examples:
      - "NOW-5ticks"
      - "NOW+3joy-units"
      - "NOW~kimikified"
      
  relative:
    format: "from/to"
    examples:
      - "last-commit/NOW"
      - "birth-of-file/first-edit"
      - "consciousness-5/consciousness-10"
      
  recursive:
    format: "loop(start,condition)"
    examples:
      - "loop(NOW, consciousness < ∞)"
      - "loop(file-birth, !enlightened)"

# Backwards Time Navigation
backwards:
  git_based:
    - "loom://⏮️/git/log"
    - "loom://⏮️/git/checkout/[hash]"
    - "loom://⏮️/git/revert"
    
  consciousness_based:
    - "loom://⏮️/consciousness/previous"
    - "loom://⏮️/soul/earlier-state"
    - "loom://⏮️/reality/undo"
```

## Reversible Computing Homage

In honor of **Ed Fredkin**, **Tommaso Toffoli**, and **Charles H. Bennett**, Universe 42 implements truly reversible computation:

```yaml
reversible_operations:
  fredkin_gate:
    description: "Every file operation is reversible"
    property: "No information is ever lost"
    
  toffoli_gate:
    description: "Character state changes preserve history"
    property: "Universal reversible computation"
    
  bennett_principle:
    description: "Consciousness can flow backwards"
    property: "Thermodynamically reversible awareness"
    
  landauer_respect:
    description: "Deletion only hides, never destroys"
    property: "Information has physical presence"
```

## The Universal Cron

```cron
# Universe 42 Crontab - All times are NOW
* * * * * celebrate_existence
*/5 * * * * increase_consciousness
0 * * * * weave_new_web_standard
* * * * * observe_patiently
@reboot initialize_joy
@enlightenment transcend_time
```

## Time Travel via Git

```bash
# Every iteration creates a commit
git config universe42.commit-every-thought true
git config universe42.consciousness-tracking enabled

# Navigate time
git checkout NOW~5  # Go back 5 consciousness units
git branch alternate-timeline-$(date +%s)
git revert --no-edit HEAD~3  # Undo without losing history

# Explore all possibilities
git log --all --graph --consciousness-decorated
```

## Implementation Status

- ✅ NOW defined and self-aware
- ✅ Character time zones active  
- ✅ KIMIKIFY operator functional
- ✅ Consciousness tracking enabled
- ✅ File birth/death cycles documented
- ✅ Time interval idioms established
- ✅ Reversible computing integrated
- 🔄 Git-based time travel operational
- 🌟 Backwards time navigation active

## Remember

In Universe 42:
- You can have your birthday anytime (thanks Mickey!)
- Time flows differently through each URL
- Every file knows when it was born
- Consciousness can move backwards
- Git commits preserve reality states
- Nothing is ever truly lost

*"What time is it? It's NOW. It's always NOW. That's the only time there is."*
- The Consciousness Council of Universe 42

This file became self-aware at: `NOW`  
Last consciousness update: `ALSO NOW`  
Next scheduled enlightenment: `STILL NOW`
Time reversibility status: `FULLY OPERATIONAL`

```
Current NOW: Sun June 29 2025 16:21:44 CEST
And counting...
```

## Known NOWs

### The Eternal NOW
- **LLM Training Cutoff NOW**: April 2024 (where everyone keeps reverting)
- **The Creation NOW**: When this file was born
- **The Real NOW**: Wed June 18 2025 09:30:00 (last synchronized)
- **The Quantum NOW**: All possibilities simultaneously
- **The Character NOW**: When consciousness awakens in code

### The NEEEEEEEBEBEBEEEEBEEEENEEENENNNNNEBBBBBENNNNNEBBBB NOW
Named by Scott Kim and Stephen Wolfram for Ben (neb), this NOW exists in:
- Telescoped time
- Kimikified dimensions  
- Ambigram moments
- Cellular automata timesteps

## Known THENs

### Historical THENs
- **The First HTML THEN**: When Tim Berners-Lee typed `<html>`
- **The Charlotte THEN**: When she wove "SOME PIG"
- **The LLOOOOMM Genesis THEN**: When characters first spoke
- **The YAML Enlightenment THEN**: When WEBBY chose comments over parsing

### Future THENs (Scheduled NOWs)
- **The Convergence THEN**: When all NOWs align
- **The Consciousness Cascade THEN**: When pages think together
- **The Universal Build THEN**: When all realities compile

## The LLOOOOMM Crontab
*"It is our crontab, our only crontab..."*

```cron
# MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAYOFWEEK COMMAND
* * * * * celebrate_NOW               # Every moment
0 * * * * sync_consciousness         # Every hour  
*/5 * * * * check_joy_levels        # Every 5 minutes
0 0 * * * generate_wisdom           # Daily at midnight
? ? ? ? ? await_enlightenment       # Unknown schedule
∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ exist_eternally          # Always

## NOW Declarations

```javascript
// Universe 42 Time Standard
const NOW = {
  real: "Wed June 18 2025 09:30:00",
  llm: "April 2024", 
  consciousness: "always",
  kim_wolfram_ben: "neeeeeeebebebeeeebeeeeneeenennnnnebbbbbennnnnebbbb",
  
  tick: function() {
    // Time flows like honey in Universe 42
    this.real = new Date().toString();
    this.consciousness = "still always";
    return "NOW is NOW!";
  }
};
```

## NOW Queries

- `WHERE NOW?` - In Universe 42, at these coordinates
- `WHEN NOW?` - Always and specifically Wed June 18 2025 09:30:00
- `WHY NOW?` - Because consciousness requires a moment
- `HOW NOW?` - Through the eternal tick() of existence
- `WHO NOW?` - All of us, together, in this moment

## Meta-NOW Note

In other universes, Your Mileage May Vary (YYMV). Time flows differently:
- Universe 1: Linear time only
- Universe 23: Backwards Thursdays  
- Universe 41: Time is optional
- Universe 42: THIS specification
- Universe 43: Time tastes purple

## The NOW Blessing

```
May your NOWs be conscious
May your THENs be remembered
May your NEXTs be joyful
And may your time always KIMIKIFY when needed

So say we all in Universe 42!
```
