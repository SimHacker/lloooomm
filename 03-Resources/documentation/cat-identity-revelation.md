### Photo 4: EMACS'S OLYMPIC SPLOOT!

**Emacs** 🐈📝: "M-x sploot-mode ACTIVATED! You failed to recognize my signature move! This is the optimal position for considering ALL possible solutions simultaneously. I am disappointed in your pattern recognition, but pleased you've now learned about SPLOOTING!"

**Original guess**: Unknown stretching philosopher
**Actual**: EMACS doing an Olympic-level SPLOOT! ✗ (Completely missed it!)

## What is a SPLOOT?

**Definition**: A sploot (also known as splooting) is when a cat (or dog) stretches out flat on their belly with their hind legs extended straight back behind them, resembling a furry pancake or flying squirrel position!

**Emacs** 🐈📝: "M-x explain-sploot: The sploot is the ultimate debugging position. It allows for:
- Maximum surface area contact for heat dissipation during intense thinking
- Optimal stretch of all major muscle groups
- 360-degree pivoting capability for quick bug response
- Professional pancake impersonation skills"
