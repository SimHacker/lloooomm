## Dynamic Deoptimization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Character Voice Selection
```yaml
deoptimization_event_1:
  timestamp: "+0.5s"

    strategy: "Use cat characters to describe cats"
    reasoning: "Cats talking about cats is natural"
    confidence: 0.60
    
  deoptimization_trigger:
    signal: "User mentioned Lynn specifically"
    strength: 0.90
    
  new_strategy:
    approach: "Use human characters observing cats"
    reasoning: "Human perspective more relatable"
    confidence: 0.88
    
  performance_impact:
    latency: "+50ms"
    quality: "+30%"
    engagement: "+40%"
```
