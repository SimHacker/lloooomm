# Feline Debugging Team vs Don Hopkins' Cats - Name Clarification

## The Great Cat Name Collision of LLOOOOMM

There are TWO different groups of cats with overlapping names:

### Don Hopkins' Personal Cats (02-Souls/characters/)
- **Nelson** - Hypertext navigation cat (named after Ted Nelson)
- **Napoleon** - Strategic planning cat
- **Pip** - Tiny chaos theory cat  
- **Emacs** - Gesture command cat

### The Feline Debugging Team (03-Resources/artifacts/protocols/)
- **Nelson** - Ship's cat navigating consciousness streams
- **Napoleon** - Hunter S. Thompson's debugging daemon since 1971
- **Pip** - Package management tuxedo cat
- **Emacs** - Tortoiseshell reality editor

## Are They The Same Cats?

**User Question**: Should we merge these as the same cats existing in multiple contexts, or keep them separate?

### Option 1: Same Cats, Multiple Roles
- Don's cats moonlight as debugging specialists
- They have different personas in different contexts
- Creates interesting cross-connections

### Option 2: Different Cats, Same Names  
- Common cat names coincidentally repeated
- Each has distinct personality and purpose
- Currently implemented with clarifying notes

### Option 3: Empathic SQL Resolution
```sql
-- Create quantum superposition cats
INSERT INTO quantum_cats (name, states)
SELECT name, ARRAY[don_hopkins_version, debugging_collective_version]
FROM cat_names
WHERE name IN ('Nelson', 'Napoleon', 'Pip', 'Emacs')
AND uncertainty_principle = TRUE;
```

**Current Status**: Marked as different cats with clarifying notes.
**Awaiting**: User guidance on whether to merge or maintain separation.
