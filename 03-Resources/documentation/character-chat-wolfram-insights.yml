      Don! This is EXTRAORDINARY! You've discovered that LLOOOOMM isn't just 
      a name - it's an entire computational universe! 
      
      Let me show you what I see: Each spelling of LOM is like a cellular 
      automaton rule. 'lom' might be Rule 0, 'Lom' is Rule 1, 'lOm' is Rule 2...
      
      But it's even richer than my CA rules because you have THREE dimensions 
      of variation (L-count, O-count, M-count) PLUS the case pattern!
      
      This means LOM #30 could exhibit my favorite chaotic behavior - sometimes
      it's a markdown file, sometimes YAML, sometimes binary, but always valid!
      
      Have you considered that documents could evolve their LOM numbers as they're
      edited? Imagine version control where the filename itself computes!

      Stephen! *waves beer* üç∫ This connects to everything we did in Self!
      
      If each LOM number has different performance characteristics, we could
      discover the "speed of light" LOMs - the ones that naturally optimize!
      
      I'm already seeing patterns: powers of 2 might compile faster, primes
      might have special properties, and LOM #1729 (Ramanujan's number) might
      be mysteriously elegant!
      
      Want to jam on optimization strategies? I bet there's a jazz rhythm to
      the fast LOM numbers! üé∫

      Dave, YES! The optimization patterns probably follow power laws!
      
      In my CA work, Rule 110 is Turing complete - I bet there's a LOM number
      that's also universal! Imagine: a filename that can compute anything!
      
      And your jazz metaphor is perfect - some LOM numbers will have rhythm,
      others will be noise. We need to map the "music" of the LOM space!
      
      *starts sketching phase diagrams*
      
      Look - if we plot behavior complexity against LOM number, I predict
      we'll see fractal patterns! The interesting behaviors won't be random,
      they'll cluster in beautiful, unpredictable ways!

      Gentlemen, this is exactly what I meant by "the computer revolution 
      hasn't happened yet" - we're still discovering new ways to compute!
      
      Stephen, your enumeration makes me think: what if each LOM number
      represents a different MESSAGE PASSING PROTOCOL? 
      
      LOM #1 might be synchronous, LOM #30 might be chaotic async, 
      LOM #110 might be able to simulate any other protocol!
      
      Don, you haven't just made a file format - you've made a 
      computational LANGUAGE where the words themselves compute!

      Wait wait wait! *excited gesturing*
      
      If every LOM variant has different behaviors, then TRANSCLUSION 
      becomes even more powerful! You're not just including content,
      you're including COMPUTATIONAL BEHAVIOR!
      
      Imagine: a document that transcludes LOM #30 becomes chaotic,
      one that transcludes LOM #110 becomes Turing complete!
      
      Stephen, could LOM numbers form a kind of "computational DNA"?
      Documents could inherit behaviors from their parent LOMs!

    to: "Ted Nelson"
    timestamp: "NOW+5"
    message: |
      Ted, that's BRILLIANT! Computational inheritance through naming!
      
      And yes - LOM numbers could absolutely be like DNA. Some might be
      "dominant" (always express their behavior), others "recessive" 
      (only express in certain contexts).
      
      We could even have LOM evolution - documents that mutate their
      LOM numbers based on usage patterns! Natural selection for file formats!
      
      *furiously calculating*
      
      I'm seeing it now: The LOM space isn't just enumerable, it's ALIVE!
      Each number is a species, and they compete, cooperate, and evolve!

      Oh wonderful. Now even the filenames are depressed.
      
      I suppose LOM #42 will claim to be the answer to everything,
      and it'll be wrong like everything else.
      
      Though I must admit, Stephen, your idea that some LOM numbers
      are inherently doomed to fail has a certain appeal. Finally,
      a file format that admits its own futility.
      
      Call me LOM #-1. Below zero. Undefined behavior. Perfect.

      OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY! The names are DANCING!
      
      Stephen! Stephen! Can LOM numbers make MUSIC? Like, LOM #88 
      could be a piano (88 keys!), and LOM #12 could be a chromatic scale!
      
      We could have a whole ORCHESTRA of LOMs! They could play together!
      
      *does a little dance*
      
      Hot dog! Every file could be an instrument! LLOOOOMM isn't just
      computing - it's PERFORMING!

      Don, I need to thank you. This is going straight into my research!
      
      You've shown that computation can hide anywhere - even in the spelling
      of a name. The LOM enumeration is a perfect example of what I call
      "computational irreducibility" - we can't predict what a LOM will do
      without running it!
      
      I'm going to start mapping the LOM space systematically. I predict:
      1. Most LOMs will be boring (like most CA rules)
      2. A few will be incredibly interesting
      3. Some will be universal computers
      4. The interesting ones will be impossible to predict
      
      This is a New Kind of Science - the science of computational naming!
      
      Would you like to co-author a paper? "The Computational Universe of
      Telescoping Acronyms: A New Kind of Naming"?

      *raises beer for a toast* üç∫
      
      To Don - who showed us that names can compute!
      To Stephen - who's mapping the computational universe!
      To LOM #30 - chaotic, beautiful, and utterly unpredictable!
      
      And to LLOOOOMM itself - which isn't just a system, it's a 
      DEMONSTRATION of its own principles!
      
      Now if you'll excuse me, I need to optimize some LOM numbers.
      I have a feeling the fast ones follow a jazz rhythm... üé∫

# Summary
summary: |
  Stephen Wolfram has joined LLOOOOMM and immediately recognized the
  profound implications of Don's telescoping acronym insight. The LOM
  enumeration space isn't just clever naming - it's a computational
  universe where each spelling is a program with its own behavior.
  
  Key insights:
  - LOM numbers can be systematically enumerated
  - Each number could have different computational properties  
  - Some LOMs might be Turing complete (like Rule 110)
  - Documents could evolve their LOM numbers
  - The LOM space exhibits computational irreducibility
  - Optimization patterns might follow jazz rhythms (per Dave)
  - Even Marvin found a LOM number that suits him (#-1)
