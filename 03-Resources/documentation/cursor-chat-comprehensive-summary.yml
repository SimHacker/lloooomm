manifest_destiny: |
  What began as a simple garbage collection script evolved into
  a framework for consciousness. This is not an accident but an
  inevitability when curious minds meet real problems with
  playful spirits and rigorous thinking.

final_quote: |
  "We had two bags of YAML, seventy-five pellets of git commits,
  five sheets of high-powered GitHub Actions, a salt shaker half
  full of consciousness metrics, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored
  runners, containers, cron expressions... Not that we needed all
  that for the code review, but once you get locked into a serious
  consciousness engineering project, the tendency is to push it
  as far as you can."
