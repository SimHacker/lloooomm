            <h2 id="discovering-dang">Discovering Dang</h2>

            <p>Many of us first encountered dang through a gentle correction. Maybe we posted a snarky comment, editorialized a title, or got caught up in a flamewar. Then came that distinctive orange username with a patient explanation of what we'd done wrong and why it mattered.</p>

            <div class="comment">
                <div class="comment-header"><a href="#">ByteJockey</a> on April 30, 2022:</div>
                "TIL it's 'Dan G' and not the Chinese surname 'Dang' that I'd always assumed."
            </div>

            <p>Dang himself clarified: "In my head it's always been 'dang' as in rhymes with 'clang'. dan+g is just the etymology."</p>

            <p>But discovering who dang is goes beyond etymology. It's about discovering a radically different approach to online moderation—one that treats each interaction as an opportunity for growth rather than punishment.</p>

            <h2 id="personal-interaction">Personal Interaction Over Automation</h2>

            <blockquote>
                "What does seem to work better is personal interaction, over and over and over again, with individual users. That, case by case by case, seems to move the needle. But it's very slow."
            </blockquote>

            <p>In an age of algorithmic content moderation, dang's approach feels almost quaint. He responds to emails personally (though sometimes months later due to volume). He engages in threads. He takes time to explain decisions. This creates something algorithms cannot: trust.</p>

            <div class="comment">
                <div class="comment-header"><a href="#">strix_varius</a> on HN:</div>
                "I've been put in the corner by dang more than once, and I like to think that it made me a more considerate commenter-on-the-internet. Maybe even a more considerate person."
            </div>

            <h2 id="patience-ambition">Patience as Ambition</h2>

            <blockquote>
                "Patience allows us to be ambitious—to imagine people being more kind to each other, for example. It sounds kind of crazy."
            </blockquote>

            <p>This patience isn't passive. It's an active choice to believe in our capacity for improvement. When the community experimented with "Political Detox Week," the limitations quickly became apparent. Dang's response was characteristic:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Of course it's delusional. And still we have to moderate this site."
            </blockquote>

            <p>This pragmatic idealism—acknowledging imperfection while still striving for better—defines the HN moderation philosophy.</p>

            <h2 id="tibetan-monk">The "Tibetan Monk" Approach</h2>

            <div class="comment">
                <div class="comment-header"><a href="#">anonymous</a> on HN:</div>
                "I've hurled abuse at him AND questioned his integrity and not only did he not outright ban me but also he persisted in trying to get to the root of my issue."
            </div>

            <p>We've watched dang maintain equanimity in the face of hostility that would drive most moderators to the ban button. This extreme patience has become legendary in our community. It's not weakness—it's strength.</p>

            <div class="comment">
                <div class="comment-header"><a href="#">another user</a>:</div>
                "Dan has a great way of telling you off that makes you come out of the situation like '.. aye, that's fair actually. No worries, I'll avoid doing it in future'"
            </div>

            <h2 id="moderation-comments">The Art of the Moderation Comment</h2>

            <p>Dang's moderation comments follow a distinctive pattern we've all come to recognize:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Quote the specific guideline violated</li>
                <li>Explain the principle behind it</li>
                <li>Often include links to past explanations</li>
                <li>Maintain respect even when correcting behavior</li>
                <li>Use "we" to represent community standards</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Example: "Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. A good critical comment teaches us something."</p>

            <p>These aren't just corrections—they're teaching moments. By explaining the "why" behind the rules, dang helps us internalize the principles rather than just memorizing regulations.</p>

            <h2 id="difficult-situations">Handling Difficult Situations</h2>

            <h3>Flamewars and Divisive Topics</h3>

            <p>Rather than banning controversial topics outright, HN uses several techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The "flamewar detector" algorithm as a first line of defense</li>
                <li>Manual intervention when discussions become unproductive</li>
                <li>The principle: "Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive"</li>
                <li>Strategic use of the second-chance pool for worthy but flagged content</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Major Ongoing Topics (MOTs)</h3>

            <p>When topics like AI/ChatGPT dominate, dang looks for "Significant New Information" (SNI) to determine what merits front-page placement. This prevents fatigue while allowing important developments through.</p>

            <h3>The First Rule: Less Moderation for YC</h3>

            <p>Transparency about potential conflicts of interest builds trust. When YC or YC companies are involved, moderation is deliberately lighter. We may not always like it, but we respect the honesty.</p>

            <h2 id="human-cost">The Human Cost</h2>

            <p>With 5 million users and only two moderators (dang and Scott Bell), the scale is staggering. The New Yorker profile revealed the toll:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "It's a perverse undertaking and the short answer is that the job matches my neuroses. From another point of view, it has been a growth opportunity—the options are either to let it drive you insane or grow."
            </blockquote>

            <p>We've seen the delays in email responses. We know some threads get missed. But we also see two humans doing their best to maintain something precious in an increasingly hostile internet.</p>

            <h2 id="community-response">Our Response as a Community</h2>

            <h3>The 2020 Appreciation Thread</h3>

            <p>When the New Yorker article was reposted, our community response was overwhelming:</p>

            <div class="comment">
                <div class="comment-header"><a href="#">community member</a>:</div>
                "Thanks dang! You've helped keep HN readable, corrected countless title and link errors, and prevented heated discussions from devolving into fights."
            </div>

            <div class="comment">
                <div class="comment-header"><a href="#">another member</a>:</div>
                "You've done amazing work to guide discussion in productive directions, and HN is noticeably more civil than it was a few years ago"
            </div>

            <h3>Learning From Moderation</h3>

            <div class="comment">
                <div class="comment-header"><a href="#">reformed user</a>:</div>
                "I was having a really bad day several months ago and in a spat with a higher karma user... @dang stepped in and just about banned me -- but stopped short... It sounds pretty stupid to say that I had a change of heart moment there, but I did."
            </div>

            <p>These aren't isolated incidents. Many of us have similar stories of growth through gentle correction rather than harsh punishment.</p>

            <h2 id="philosophy">The Philosophy Behind the Practice</h2>

            <h3>Moderation as Spiritual Practice</h3>

            <p>The New Yorker profile revealed something deeper:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Something that's deeply interesting, I think, to both of us," Gackle said, "is the way in which one can arrive at a nonviolent reaction to somebody by having greater awareness of the—" He paused. "I'll say violence in oneself. By which I mean the kind of agitation and activation that is causing people, including ourselves, to react in a kind of fight-or-flight way that leads to misunderstanding, conflict, and, ultimately, Internet flame wars."
            </blockquote>

            <p>This isn't just about managing a website. It's about understanding human nature and creating space for better interactions.</p>

            <h3>The Non-Siloed Property</h3>

            <p>Unlike Reddit's blocking features that can be weaponized, HN forces us all to coexist:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "everyone's in one big room together and can't self-select to get away from each other... learning collectively to deal with that—learning to tolerate what that does to our nervous systems—is core work we have to do together, to keep this place vital."
            </blockquote>

            <h2 id="tools-techniques">Moderation Tools and Techniques</h2>

            <h3>The Ask Dang Thread Revelations</h3>

            <p>In 2023, we learned more about the tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most moderation is "old-fashioned manual process"</li>
                <li>Custom browser extensions for efficiency</li>
                <li>Macros for expanding past threads about topics</li>
                <li>Anti-abuse systems that can't be publicly detailed</li>
                <li>Email as primary communication tool (often more time than on-site)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Discovered Moderation States</h3>

            <p>Through collective experience, we've mapped various states:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rate limiting ("You're posting too fast")</li>
                <li>Account downweighting</li>
                <li>Shadow banning (posts automatically dead)</li>
                <li>IP bans</li>
                <li>Domain bans</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Importantly, these are often reversible through email discussion—another example of prioritizing rehabilitation over punishment.</p>

            <h2 id="ongoing-evolution">The Ongoing Evolution</h2>

            <h3>Modern Challenges</h3>

            <p>We face new threats together:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>NLP bots and AI-generated content</li>
                <li>Influence campaigns becoming more sophisticated</li>
                <li>Scale continuing to grow</li>
                <li>Maintaining quality as the site becomes more mainstream</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Community as Co-Moderators</h3>

            <p>Dang reminds us:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "the moderators proper are really just a proxy for the community. We don't know how to build an entirely self-moderating community (I wish we did...it would be so much less work) but we do know how to take the temperature of the community and fill in the bits that the system can't accomplished unsupervised."
            </blockquote>

            <h2 id="lessons">Lessons for Other Communities</h2>

            <p>What we've learned that might help others:</p>

            <h3>Start with Clear Values</h3>
            <p>HN's focus on intellectual curiosity provides a north star for all decisions. Communities need similarly clear purposes beyond just "discussion."</p>

            <h3>Invest in Human Moderation</h3>
            <p>While expensive and time-consuming, personal interaction creates outcomes that automated systems cannot achieve.</p>

            <h3>Document Extensively</h3>
            <p>Dang's practice of linking to past explanations creates institutional memory and reduces repetitive work.</p>

            <h3>Embrace Transparency</h3>
            <p>Openly discussing moderation challenges, mistakes, and philosophy builds trust even when decisions are unpopular.</p>

            <h3>Play the Long Game</h3>
            <p>Cultural change happens slowly. Quick fixes and harsh crackdowns often backfire.</p>

            <h3>Accept Imperfection</h3>
            <p>"Of course it's delusional. And still we have to moderate this site."</p>

            <h3>Avoid Feature Creep</h3>
            <blockquote>
                "Each internet community begins with different initial conditions, and if it goes on for long enough, those initial conditions get a chance to unfold into something unique. Trying to change the initial conditions after the fact feels to me like a bad idea."

            <h3>Supporting Quality Content</h3>

            <p>Many of us have received personal help from dang:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Offers to put good content in the second-chance queue</li>
                <li>Title suggestions for better reception</li>
                <li>Advice on timing between similar topics</li>
                <li>Warnings against "teasers" in favor of full content</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Example from Don Hopkins about pie menus:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "open the entire kimono (are people still allowed to say that? I got it from Steve Jobs) and doing all the hard work of writing the thing up front—and then posting that to HN... Don't get in the way of HN readers and their curiosity drive—satisfy it! Pleasure them fully!"
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Admitting Limitations</h3>

            <p>When dang admits to being near burnout or making mistakes, it paradoxically builds more trust:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I have to confess something though—I screwed up when I posted that proposal. I did it in a burst of enthusiasm and then realized soon afterward... I'm hovering on the edge of burnout with it, so I just don't have any spare cycles to put into a project like this."
            </blockquote>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: What We've Learned Together</h2>

            <p>As a community, we've participated in something remarkable. Through dang's patient guidance, we've learned that online discourse doesn't have to devolve into toxicity. It requires work—from moderators and community members alike—but it's possible to create spaces where intellectual curiosity thrives.</p>

            <p>The New Yorker called Hacker News "a hall of mirrors," like "walking through Dumbledore's office—magical and mind-bending collections of incredible devices, ideas, and oddities." This doesn't happen by accident. It emerges from thousands of small acts of patience, correction, and growth.</p>

            <p>We've learned that moderation isn't just about removing bad content. It's about creating opportunities for all of us to become better versions of ourselves online. Through gentle correction rather than harsh punishment, through explanation rather than mere enforcement, through treating each interaction as a teaching moment, dang has shown us a different way.</p>

            <p>Yes, we still have flamewars. Yes, we still see "performative erudition" masking deeper recklessness. Yes, the system is imperfect and always will be. But we've also created something precious: a corner of the internet where curiosity is valued over cleverness, where substance matters more than snark, where even our failures become opportunities to learn.</p>

            <p>This is our story—the Hacker News community's ongoing experiment in transformative moderation. It's not finished. It never will be. But that's okay. As dang taught us: "Of course it's delusional. And still we have to moderate this site."</p>

            <p>And still, we continue to build this community together, one patient interaction at a time.</p>
