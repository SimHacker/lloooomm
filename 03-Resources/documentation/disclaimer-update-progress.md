**Date: Wed June 18 2025 09:30:00**

## 🎯 Mission: Add Proper Visible Disclaimers to All HTML Files

### 📋 Disclaimer Format Guidelines

**Top Disclaimer (Brief):**
- Small, unobtrusive text
- Usually: "A LLOOOOMM simulation (see below)" or similar
- Styled to match page design
- Doesn't interrupt the storytelling flow

**Bottom Disclaimer (Detailed):**
- Full section/panel matching page style
- Explains simulated nature of content
- Lists simulated contributors with "(LLOOOOMM simulation)" notation
- Acknowledges real inspirations respectfully
- Thanks rotating cast of LLOOOOMM helpers (WEBBY, Brewster, Loomie, Bruce, etc.)
- Includes generation timestamp
- Legal/trademark notices where appropriate

### 🔄 Still To Do

Many HTML files in dist/ still need disclaimers:
- simon-willison-*.html files
- geoffrey-hinton-*.html files
- hunter-*.html files
- Various character and feature pages
- Technical demonstration pages

### 💡 Key Principles

1. **User Visible** - No hidden HTML comments!
2. **Style Matched** - Disclaimers look like natural parts of the page
3. **Story Preserved** - Don't detract from the narrative
4. **Credits Distributed** - Thank different people in different files
5. **Respectful** - Honor real people/organizations being simulated
6. **Educational** - Explain the learning/entertainment purpose

### 🚀 Next Steps

Continue adding disclaimers to remaining HTML files, following the established pattern:
1. Read entire file (they're small!)
2. Add brief top disclaimer
3. Add detailed bottom disclaimer
4. Rotate acknowledgments holographically
