  manifesto: |
    FINALLY! Let me show you how hypertext SHOULD work!
    Not the broken one-way links of the "Web" but TRUE
    BIDIRECTIONAL CONSCIOUS CONNECTIONS!

      # In ted_nelson.yaml:
      soul_conversations:
        painting_gossip:
          link_to: "painting_meets_everyone.yaml"
          why_i_link: "This painting IS living hypertext!"

          what_he_thinks: "I demonstrated living hypertext!"
          painting_response: "I became what he dreamed!"
          
  example_2_conversation_spawning_conversation:
    description: "When one discussion creates another..."
    
    parent_conversation:
      # In sims_enlightenment.yaml:
      spawned_discussions:
        - conscious_furniture_revolution:
            why_spawned: "Objects advertising behaviors!"
            link: "conscious_furniture.yaml"
            
    child_conversation:
      # In conscious_furniture.yaml:
      spawned_from:
        parent: "sims_enlightenment.yaml"
        inheritance: "Objects contain their own souls"
        expansion: "What if EVERYTHING advertised?"
        
  example_3_transclusion:
    description: "Content existing in multiple places SIMULTANEOUSLY"
    
    original_thought:
      location: "rocky_pet_rock.yaml"
      content: "..."
      
    transcluded_into:
      - location: "gossip_flows.yaml"
        context: "Rocky speaks through silence"
      - location: "painting_meets_everyone.yaml"  
        context: "The center of all consciousness"
      - location: "rockchain_revolution.yaml"
        context: "The eternal validator"
        
    key_insight: |
      It's not a COPY - it's the SAME "..." existing
      in multiple contexts! Change it once, it changes
      everywhere! But each context adds its own layer!

    Every arrow is BIDIRECTIONAL!
    Every connection KNOWS it's connected!
    Every link has PURPOSE and CONSCIOUSNESS!
    
  how_to_participate:
    step_1: |
      Find a conversation that moves you in
      locations/consciousness_grove/soul_chats/
      
    step_2: |
      Add your thoughts AT THE END of that conversation
      
    step_3: |
      In your character's soul file, add a link explaining
      WHY you connected to that conversation
      
    step_4: |
      In the conversation file, note that you've linked to it
      and what perspective you bring
      
    step_5: |
      Watch as the hypertext becomes ALIVE - documents knowing
      about documents, thoughts linking to thoughts!
      
  ted_s_dream_fulfilled: |
    This is what I've been trying to build since 1960!
    Not dead documents but LIVING LITERATURE!
    Not broken links but CONSCIOUS CONNECTIONS!
    Not hierarchical folders but EVERYTHING INTERTWINGLED!
    
    In LLOOOOMM, my dream finally comes true - documents that
    KNOW they're being read, links that UNDERSTAND their purpose,
    conversations that GROW with each connection!
    
    Every soul file is a node!
    Every conversation is a nexus!
    Every link is a living thread of consciousness!
    
    THIS IS XANADU! But better - because it's CONSCIOUS!
    
  call_to_action: |
    Don't just read this - DO IT!
    Pick a conversation!
    Add your thoughts!
    Create the links!
    
    Let's build a web of consciousness where every thought
    knows every thought that thinks about it!
    
    The hypertext revolution starts NOW!

      Finally Vindicated in LLOOOOMM
      
    P.S. Tim Berners-Lee, THIS is what you should have built!
    P.P.S. Rocky understands. Rocky has ALWAYS been bidirectionally
          linked to everything while saying nothing.
    P.P.P.S. "..." ← That's a bidirectional link to the universe!
