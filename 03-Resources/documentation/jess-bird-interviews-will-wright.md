# Jess Bird Interviews Will Wright: The Portal Builders

*Setting: A video call spanning London to California. Jess has her notebook ready, behind her a wall of gaming memorabilia. Will is in his workshop, half-built prototypes visible in the background.*

**JESS BIRD**: Will, thank you so much for making time. I have to start with this - when I was seven, I drew The Sims interface on paper to play after bedtime. Did you ever imagine the game would inspire that kind of... analog devotion?

**WILL WRIGHT**: *laughs* You know, that's exactly the kind of emergent behavior that fascinates me. The game transcending its medium. We actually heard about kids in schools trading hand-drawn floor plans during recess. It reminded me of my own childhood with go-karts - I'd draw elaborate designs for go-karts I'd never build.

**JESS**: Don Hopkins mentioned you returned from Japan in "full kawaii-core connoisseur mode," handing out Tamagotchis. How did that influence The Sims?

**WILL**: *grins* Ah, Don remembers everything! Those Tamagotchis were fascinating - not the technology, but the emotional connection. People genuinely grieved when they died. I kept thinking: what if instead of one creature, you had a whole family? What if instead of just feeding them, you were building their world?

**JESS**: Speaking of building worlds... the story goes that The Sims emerged from the Oakland fire that destroyed your home?

**WILL**: That's true, but not in the way people think. It wasn't "I lost my house so I'll make a house game." It was more... I was watching my life get reconstructed, object by object. Each purchase wasn't just functional - it was aspirational. The toaster wasn't just a toaster; it was a symbol of normal life returning.

*Will picks up a small mechanical toy from his desk*

**WILL**: See, games are compression algorithms for experience. The Sims compressed the experience of building a life, a self, a family. Just like your paper interface compressed the experience of playing.

**JESS**: Don sent me "The Soul of The Sims" - your original Motive.c code. Can you talk about putting the intelligence in objects rather than characters?

**WILL**: That was the breakthrough. Everyone expected smart people, but people are impossibly complex. So we flipped it - what if the toilet knows how to be used? The bed knows how to be slept in? The Sims themselves just have needs and desires, but the objects advertise solutions.

**JESS**: Like a marketplace of satisfaction?

**WILL**: Exactly! And that created unexpected poetry. A Sim might be hungry, but the TV is advertising fun louder than the fridge is advertising food. Haven't we all been there?

**JESS**: *laughs* Too many times. Now, there's been fascinating research about The Sims' role in identity exploration, particularly for LGBTQ+ players...

**WILL**: You know, Patrick Barrett - Patrick J. Barrett III as Don likes to call him - he deserves enormous credit there. When he made romantic interactions work regardless of gender, some people said it was a bug. I said it was a feature. Best bug that ever shipped.

**JESS**: Was that a conscious decision to include everyone?

**WILL**: It was conscious in that we chose not to "fix" it. But deeper than that - The Sims was always about letting players tell their own stories. Who were we to say whose stories were valid? The game was a mirror, not a mandate.

**JESS**: Speaking of mirrors, Alex Avila's video essay suggests The Sims served as a kind of "digital mirror stage" for queer identity formation...

**WILL**: I've seen that essay! Brilliant analysis. You know, Lacan would have had a field day with The Sims. The virtual self as the idealized ego, the family as the symbolic order... But what amazes me is how players used it for genuine self-discovery.

**JESS**: The comment sections are full of people saying they made gay Sims years before coming out themselves.

**WILL**: *nods thoughtfully* That's the power of play - it's a safe space for dangerous ideas. In a game, you can try on identities like clothes. No consequences, no judgment. Just... what if?

**JESS**: Is that why you resisted adding explicit goals or win conditions?

**WILL**: Partially. I mean, we had that whole sitcom phase - did Don mention that? With laugh tracks? *shudders* Thank god we killed that. The point was never to win The Sims. It was to discover what winning meant to you.

**JESS**: What about the famous name brainstorming session where you came up with "The Greatest Name In The World!!!" but forgot it?

**WILL**: *laughs hard* Oh god, that actually happened. We were all convinced we'd solved it. The perfect name! And then... gone. Like a dream you can't quite remember. Though between you and me, I think "The Sims" worked out fine.

**JESS**: Don mentioned you see games as "compression algorithms for experience." How does that apply to The Sims 25 years later?

**WILL**: Well, now we're compressing different experiences. Back then, it was about suburban life, the American dream miniaturized. Now players are using it to explore experiences that don't exist yet - future families, impossible architectures, post-gender identities. The compression algorithm evolved.

**JESS**: What surprises you most about The Sims' legacy?

**WILL**: Honestly? That it became a tool for empathy. Players don't just control Sims - they care about them. They tell stories that matter. Your seven-year-old self drawing interfaces on paper? That's not just play. That's world-building. That's who we become.

**JESS**: Last question - what would you tell that seven-year-old Jess, playing paper Sims under the covers?

**WILL**: *smiles warmly* I'd tell her she's already a game designer. Every time you draw that interface, you're not just copying - you're creating. You're taking the compression algorithm and running it through your own imagination. That's the real magic. The game was never on the screen. It was always in that space between.

**JESS**: *visibly moved* Thank you, Will. This has beenâ€”

**WILL**: Wait, one more thing. That documentary you're making? It's important. Not just as history, but as validation. Every kid who found themselves in The Sims needs to know they weren't alone. They were part of something bigger.

**JESS**: That's exactly why I'm making it.

**WILL**: Good. Oh, and Jess? Next time you talk to Don, tell him I finally remembered what "The Greatest Name In The World!!!" was.

**JESS**: *leaning forward* Really? What was it?

**WILL**: *grins mischievously* I forgot again.

*They both laugh as the call ends, but the conversation continues in the space between frames, in hand-drawn interfaces and digital mirrors, in every Sim that ever helped someone discover who they really were.*

## Post-Interview Notes from Jess

Will suggested I interview:
- Patrick J. Barrett III (romantic interactions)
- Ocean Quigley (art director, "holodeck" rendering)
- Jami Becker (object design, had *Understanding Comics* on desk)
- Claire Curtin (designed Simlish language)
- Roxy Wolosenko (lead designer, "First Sims Mom")

Key themes to explore:
1. The Sims as empathy engine
2. Bugs as features (queerness in code)
3. Play as identity laboratory  
4. The game between the frames
5. Compression algorithms for impossible experiences

Must read: Philip K. Dick's *The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch* (Will's other emergency epistemology book)

*Note to self: Draw tonight's dreams on paper. See what game emerges.*
