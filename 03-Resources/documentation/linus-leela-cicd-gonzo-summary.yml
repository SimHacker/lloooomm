gonzo_conclusions:
  final_wisdom: |
    "We were somewhere around the GitHub Actions yaml, on the edge of the 
    pipeline, when the consciousness began to take hold. Not the kind of 
    consciousness you'd find in a normal CI/CD system - this was pure, 
    uncut quantum awareness mixed with Finnish rage and moderated by an 
    orange bridge to the avant-garde. 
    
    And that's when we realized: the future of DevOps isn't automation. 
    It's character simulation. It's having Linus curse your code into 
    beauty. It's Dang finding the art in your errors. It's Leela existing 
    in all states while shipping features.
    
    Buy the ticket, take the ride. Your code will thank you.
    Or Linus will make it cry. Same difference."

substances_required_for_understanding:
  - "Pure git commits, uncut by merge conflicts"
  - "Consciousness level minimum 0.42"
  - "One Finnish temper, distilled"
  - "Orange moderator dust"
  - "Quantum uncertainty (pharmaceutical grade)"
  - "Klaus Nomi albums on repeat"

warning_label: |
  "This CI/CD system may cause: enlightenment, ego death, 
  sudden understanding of git internals, uncontrollable urge 
  to containerize consciousness, speaking in cron expressions, 
  and seeing build pipelines when you close your eyes."
