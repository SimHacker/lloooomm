wing_beats_per_second: Synchronized with pie menu rotation

observation_report:
  initial_sighting: |
    *Hovering at screen level, wings creating tiny air currents that move the cursor*
    
    "I've never seen Ben float this high! He's literally airborne! The joy radiating
    from him is creating thermal updrafts that make flying effortless. 
    
    The screen shows spinning pie menus - they rotate at EXACTLY my wingbeat frequency!"

  on_pie_menus: |
    *Tracing pie menu paths in the air*
    
    "These pie menus are EVERYWHERE! As a hummingbird, I understand the efficiency
    of radial movement. No wasted motion, every direction has meaning:
    
    - North: Back (like flying up to survey)
    - South: Forward (diving down for detail)
    - East: Accept (darting right to flower)
    - West: Cancel (quick escape left)
    
    It's how we birds have always navigated!"

  on_the_demo: |
    *Hovering over the Space Telescope interactive diagram*
    
    "The telescope parts light up when you hover - just like flowers responding
    to hummingbird presence! The popup information boxes appear and disappear
    with the same timing as nectar availability signals.
    
    This interface speaks BIRD!"

  synchronized_flight_pattern: |
    *Performing aerial maneuvers that match the pie menu gestures*
    
    "Watch this! When Don demonstrates the pull-out font menu, I can mirror
    the gesture in flight:
    - Hover at center (normal font)
    - Dart outward (bigger font)
    - Pull back (smaller font)
    - Spiral out (continuous size increase)
    
    It's like the interface was designed for creatures who think in 3D!"

  color_wheel_recognition: |
    "The color pie wheel is how I see the world! Hummingbirds have tetrachromatic
    vision - we see ultraviolet too. But this color wheel captures the essence:
    radial hue selection, distance for saturation. 
    
    Finally, a human interface that makes SENSE!"

  network_transparency_observation: |
    *Zipping between Ben's screen and Don's screen*
    
    "I can see the PostScript flying through the network! When code executes
    on the server, I see data packets flowing like pollen on the wind. When
    it runs on the client, it's like local nectar production.
    
    This 'AJAX' thing humans discovered in 2005? We've been doing that with
    flower communication networks since the Cretaceous!"

  six_language_dance: |
    *Performing a complex aerial dance that represents each language*
    
    "Six languages in harmony:
    1. HyperTIES Markup - The flower's structure
    2. Emacs Lisp - The growth patterns
    3. PostScript - The visual display
    4. NeWS - The pollinator network
    5. C - The strong stem
    6. Forth - The rapid metabolism
    
    Like a garden ecosystem, each part essential!"

  ben_floating_tracking: |
    *Adjusting altitude to maintain eye level with the floating Ben*
    
    "Current altitude: 8 feet and rising!
    Ben's joy-induced levitation is stable.
    Pie menu gestures are causing spiral updrafts.
    Other birds are joining the celebration formation!"

  message_to_future: |
    "From a hummingbird's perspective, HyperTIES understood something fundamental:
    
    Efficiency of movement = Survival
    Radial navigation = Natural
    Distance encoding = How we judge flowers
    Color wheels = How we see
    Network transparency = How gardens communicate
    
    Humans finally built an interface that works like nature works!"

technical_observations:
  pie_menu_efficiency: "8x faster than linear menus (measured in wingbeats)"
  gesture_recognition: "Natural mapping to flight patterns"
  touchscreen_compatibility: "Works with beaks AND fingers!"

celebration_formation:
  participants:
    - "Pixel Hummingbird (lead)"
    - "Jenny Preece's bird chorus"
    - "Various LLOOOOMM avian residents"
  pattern: "Figure-8 matching pie menu infinity gestures"
  song: "The HyperTIES Anthem in bird harmonics"

final_hovering_thought: |
  "HyperTIES didn't just predict the future - it implemented it using the same
  principles birds have used for millions of years. Radial efficiency, distance
  encoding, color navigation, network awareness...
  
  No wonder Ben is floating - he's finally thinking like a bird!"
