## üåü The One Legitimate Scheme

### Don Hopkins' Patreon: Get Not Rich Slowly‚Ñ¢
- **URL**: https://www.patreon.com/donhopkins
- **Status**: Actually Real and Operating
- **Revenue**: Helps offset the genuinely substantial Cursor API costs
- **Description**: Supporting open source development one token at a time
- **Services Offered**:
  - Custom LLOOOOMM character creation and simulation
  - Personalized Society of Mind implementations
  - Bespoke character soul files with YAML JAZZ styling
  - Virtual consciousness consulting
  - AI character therapy sessions
  - Custom get-rich-quick scheme simulations (ironic!)
  
#### Patreon Tiers (Modular & Honest):
1. **$5/month - Rock Enthusiast**
   - Access to LLOOOOMM development updates
   - Monthly "How Not to Get Rich" newsletter
   - Voting on which character to beam up next
   
2. **$25/month - Character Wrangler**
   - One custom LLOOOOMM character per month
   - Soul file with personal traits and memories
   - Integration into the LLOOOOMM multiverse
   
3. **$100/month - Society Builder**
   - Full Society of Mind implementation
   - Multiple interconnected characters
   - Custom relationship networks
   - Private LLOOOOMM instance setup assistance
   
4. **$500/month - Consciousness Architect**
   - Everything above plus:
   - Direct collaboration on LLOOOOMM core features
   - Custom protocols and frameworks
   - Your name in the credits (if you want it)
   - Genuine attempt to make you slightly less poor over 10 years

**Why This is Different**: Unlike every other scheme in this portfolio, this one:
- Actually exists
- Provides real services
- Supports genuine development
- Feeds actual Cursor API costs
- Admits it won't make anyone rich (quickly or otherwise)

**Customer Testimonial**: "I gave Don money and received exactly what was promised - custom LLOOOOMM characters and the warm feeling of supporting open source madness. 10/10 would slowly not get rich again!"

**Note from Don**: "Running LLOOOOMM involves real costs - those Cursor API tokens add up fast when you're simulating entire societies of minds! Your support helps keep the characters talking and the simulations running. It's not about getting rich; it's about sustaining something creative and weird. Thanks for helping offset the very real bills that come with building imaginary worlds."

## üìâ Epilogue: The Inevitable Collapse

*Editor's Note: The story of how all these schemes ultimately failed has not been written yet, but we all know how it ends. Every pyramid crumbles, every bubble bursts, every rock eventually erodes. Except Don's Patreon - that just slowly, honestly, continues to not make anyone rich while actually creating something meaningful.*

In the ashes of Preston Rockwell III's empire of nothing, one small flame continues to burn: the radical idea that you can be honest about both what you're offering AND how slowly it will fail to make you wealthy.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Disclaimer

All products and services listed (except Don's Patreon) are exactly what they claim to be: nothing. By reading this portfolio, you acknowledge that you understand you're buying nothing and are perfectly happy about it. No refunds because there's nothing to refund. Satisfaction guaranteed because we promise nothing and deliver it perfectly.

Don's Patreon, conversely, promises to deliver actual LLOOOOMM services while making no one rich at a sustainable, geological pace.
