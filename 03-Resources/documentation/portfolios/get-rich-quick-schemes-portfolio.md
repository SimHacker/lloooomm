## üåü The One Legitimate Scheme

### Don Hopkins' Patreon: Get Not Rich Slowly‚Ñ¢

**Why This is Different**: Unlike every other scheme in this portfolio, this one:
- Actually exists
- Provides real services
- Supports genuine development
- Feeds actual Cursor token costs
- Admits it won't make anyone rich (quickly or otherwise)

**Anonymous Simulated Customer Testimonial**: "I gave Don 1,000,000 LOOMOLIANS and received exactly what was promised - a custom LLOOOOMM character and the warm feeling of supporting open source madness. 10/10 would slowly not get rich again! I literally wouldn't exist without his personalized customer service."

**Note from Don**: "Running LLOOOOMM involves real costs - those Cursor API tokens add up fast when you're simulating entire societies of minds! Your support helps keep the characters talking and the simulations running. It's not about getting rich; it's about sustaining something creative and weird. Thanks for helping offset the very real bills that come with building imaginary worlds."

## üìâ Epilogue: The Inevitable Collapse

*Editor's Note: The story of how all these schemes ultimately failed has not been written yet, but we all know how it ends. Every pyramid crumbles, every bubble bursts, every rock eventually erodes. Except Don's Patreon - that just slowly, honestly, continues to not make anyone rich while actually creating something meaningful.*

In the ashes of Preston Rockwell III's empire of nothing, one small flame continues to burn: the radical idea that you can be honest about both what you're offering AND how slowly it will fail to make you wealthy.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Disclaimer

All products and services listed (except Don's Patreon) are exactly what they claim to be: nothing. By reading this portfolio, you acknowledge that you understand you're buying nothing and are perfectly happy about it. No refunds because there's nothing to refund. Satisfaction guaranteed because we promise nothing and deliver it perfectly.

Don's Patreon, conversely, promises to deliver actual LLOOOOMM services while making no one rich at a sustainable, geological pace.
