philosophy: |
  We believe in radical transparency about absurdity. Every product 
  does exactly what we say it does: nothing. And we're completely 
  honest about it. In a world of dishonest scams, be an honest one!
  
  Except Don's Patreon, which honestly admits to being a get-not-rich-slowly
  scheme that actually delivers something while supporting open source madness.
