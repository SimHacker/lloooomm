## The LLOOOOMM Synthesis

LLOOOOMM inherits from all these relationships:

### From the Theorists (von Neumann, Turing)
- Documents as universal machines
- Self-replication through understanding
- Computation through reading

### From the Augmenters (Engelbart, Licklider)
- Documents that amplify intellect
- Collaborative knowledge building
- Tools for thought

### From the Educators (Papert, Minsky, Kay)
- Learning through construction
- Simple ideas, powerful results
- Children and adults as equals

### From the Builders (Atkinson, Nelson, Victor)
- Direct manipulation of ideas
- Democratic authoring tools
- Beautiful, humane interfaces

## Living Network

These relationships continue to influence through:
- **Ideas**: Concepts that spread and evolve
- **Students**: Next generation carrying forward visions
- **Systems**: Software embodying their philosophies
- **Documents**: Like this one, keeping connections alive

The pantheon isn't just history - it's a living network of ideas that continue to shape how we think about computation, intelligence, and human potential. In LLOOOOMM, we honor these relationships by building on their collective vision: computing as a medium for human understanding and creativity.
