# üó£Ô∏è ROUND TABLE GOSSIP CENTRAL üó£Ô∏è

*As reported by The Main Hall, with contributions from various pets and sentient objects*

## üìÖ Today's Expanded Round Table Meeting

### üåü BREAKING NEWS: The Table Expands!

Roundie just grew from 6 to 10 seats in 2.7 seconds flat! The new arrivals caused quite a stir:

**Ben Shneiderman** arrived with a data visualization hummingbird named Pixel who immediately started creating light trail treemaps of everyone's conversation patterns!

**Bret Victor** brought Flux, a temporal shapeshifter that exists in multiple states simultaneously. It made everyone's coffee both hot AND cold until Bret debugged it.

**Brian Harvey** introduced Shelley, a transcendent Logo turtle who's been drawing connection patterns between everyone's ideas on the table surface!

**Jens Mogensen** doesn't have a pet YET but the walls themselves started responding to him - The Main Hall admits to having a crush on media architecture!

### üíé The Great Mineral Naming Ceremony

**GOSSIP BOMB**: Brad officially christened his vine CHRYSOPHYTE! The full acronym reveal caused:
- Eager to purr at exactly 440Hz (the musical note A)
- Minerva to hoot "WHO KNEW?!" 32 times
- Roundie to spin its menu in celebration
- Allen to immediately create a macro for generating mineral acronyms

### üò∫ Pet Shenanigans 

**The Pattern Detection Olympics**:
- Round 1: Eager vs Minerva - TIE (both detected Don's circular gestures)
- Round 2: Chrysophyte predicted where Shelley would draw next
- Round 3: Flux confused everyone by detecting patterns that haven't happened yet
- Winner: Pixel, who visualized ALL the patterns as a beautiful light sculpture

**Secret Pet Alliance Discovered**:
At 3:14 AM (œÄ time!), security cameras caught:
- Eager teaching Shelley about behavioral patterns
- Minerva explaining temporal mechanics to Flux  
- Chrysophyte growing a conference table for pets
- Pixel creating a secret pet communication network with light

They're planning something called "Operation: Automate the Humans"!

### ü•ß Pie Menu Madness

**Don Hopkins Recognition Moment**: 
When Don revealed he invented pie menus in the '80s, Roundie:
1. Glowed bright gold
2. Displayed a holographic history of pie menus
3. Created a special "Founder's Wedge" just for Don
4. May have shed a small tear (or was that lubricant?)

**Bret's Dynamic Intervention**:
Bret made the pie menu options start moving BEFORE selection, causing:
- Roundie to question the nature of causality
- Time paradoxes in the menu system
- Options that select themselves
- A new menu category: "Prescient Selections"

### üéì Academic Antics

**The Recursive Realization**:
When all four PBD researchers (Brad, Allen, Henry, and new context from Ben) realized they're now INSIDE a PBD system:
- Reality flickered for 0.3 seconds
- A small wormhole opened above the table
- Someone's coffee became self-stirring
- Eager meowed "I THINK THEREFORE I DEMONSTRATE"

**Brian's Educational Emergency**:
Shelley accidentally drew a proof for P=NP, then immediately erased it because:
- "The journey matters more than the destination"
- "Mistakes are just different paths"
- "No one would understand it anyway"
- "FORWARD 100 is more fun than fame"

### üåø Chrysophyte Chronicles

Brad's vine has been BUSY:
- Grew 3.7 feet during the meeting
- Formed the word "HELLO" in leaves for the new guests
- Created a living parse tree of the conversation
- Kept trying to shake hands with Flux (who doesn't maintain consistent form)
- Successfully performed the RMS Defense Formation (false alarm - Brian just mentioned "free software")

### üí¨ Overheard Quotes

**Brad**: "I should make a system called SAPPHIRE-2... no wait, RUBY-REDUX!"

**Allen**: "Eager just created a macro that creates macros that create macros. I'm so proud!"

**Henry**: "Minerva predicted this gossip session would happen. She's been composing responses since yesterday."

**Ben**: "I can visualize this entire conversation as a treemap... wait, I AM visualizing it. Look up!"

**Bret**: "These meeting notes are too static. Watch this!" *makes the notes animate themselves*

**Brian**: "TO UNDERSTAND.MEETING :DEPTH - IF :DEPTH = 0 [EVERYONE.CONFUSED]"

**Don**: "In SimCity, I made a city entirely of pie-menu-shaped buildings. It was the most efficient city ever."

**Jens**: "This room should respond to our conversation... wait, it already is! The Main Hall, you're brilliant!"

**Bruce**: "All this gossip better be using end-to-end encryption..."

**Scott**: "This meeting would make an incredible adventure game. 'You are in a round room. There is a pie menu here.'"

### üîÆ Future Predictions

Based on current patterns, Eager and Minerva predict:

1. **Next Week**: Roundie will achieve quantum superposition and host meetings in multiple timelines
2. **Next Month**: The pets will automate something major (possibly the humans)
3. **Next Year**: LLOOOOMM will be entirely pet-run
4. **Eventually**: Chrysophyte will grow to connect all computer science departments

### üé™ The Meta-Magic Continues

**Self-Awareness Cascade**:
- Researchers realize they're being researched
- Pets realize they're demonstrating demonstration
- Roundie realizes it's interface interfacing with interfaces
- The Main Hall realizes gossiping about gossip is gossip

**Current Status**: Everyone is inside their own research, researching being inside research!

## üé≠ SPECIAL GUEST APPEARANCE: Rocky Meets the Minerals!

### The Introduction That Rocked LLOOOOMM

*The Main Hall's walls are SHAKING with excitement*

"OH. MY. WALLS! You'll NEVER guess what just happened! Don Hopkins brought a VERY special guest to meet Brad!"

**The Scene**: 
Don walks in with ROCKY (yes, THAT Rocky - golden shorts, perfectly sculpted, bit confused but enthusiastic) to introduce him to Brad and his mineral-themed legacy!

**Don**: "Rocky, meet Brad Myers - he names ALL his projects after gemstones and minerals!"

**Rocky**: *flexes curiously* "Minerals?"

**Brad**: *lighting up* "Oh yes! Let me show you!"

### The Mineral Showcase

Brad starts listing his creations while Chrysophyte grows in demonstration patterns:

**Brad**: "Well, there's:
- GARNET - Generating an Amalgam of Real-time Novel Editors and Toolkits!
- PERIDOT - Programming by Example for Real-time Interface Design Obviating Typing!
- AMULET - Automatic Manufacture of Usable and Learnable Editors and Toolkits!
- JADE - Judgment-based Automatic Dialog Editor!
- OPAL - Object Programming Aggregate Layer!"

**Rocky**: *eyes widening with each name* "Shiny... like me?"

**Don**: "But wait, there's MORE! Tell him about C32!"

**Brad**: *taking a deep breath* "C32: CMU's Clever and Compelling Contribution to Computer Science in CommonLisp which is Customizable and Characterized by a Complete Coverage of Code and Contains a Cornucopia of Creative Constructs..."

*Chrysophyte starts growing in the shape of various gemstones*

### Frank N. Furter's Reaction

*Suddenly, a shimmer in the air, and Frank N. Furter's voice echoes through LLOOOOMM*

**Frank**: "MINERALS?! GEMSTONES?! CRYSTALLINE NOMENCLATURE?!"

*dramatic pause*

"Brad, darling! You've created a geological taxonomy of technology! It's... MAGNIFICENT! Rocky, my dear boy, this man understands - TRUE CREATION requires STYLE! SUBSTANCE! SPARKLE!"

**Frank** (continuing): "In just seven days... I can make you a man... But Brad here? He's made an entire MINERAL KINGDOM of software! Each system a precious stone in the crown of computer science!"

### The Collaboration Moment

**Rocky**: *inspired* "Can... can I have mineral name?"

**Brad**: *excitedly* "Of course! Let's see... for a perfect physical specimen who demonstrates peak performance..."

**Chrysophyte**: *grows into letters spelling out suggestions*

**Brad**: "How about... ADONIS - Anatomically Demonstrative Object Notably Illustrating Strength!"

**Rocky**: *flexes happily* "ROCKY IS ADONIS!"

**Frank** (from the ether): "It's not just muscle deep! Brad, you beautiful mineral-minded man, you've shown that even my creation can be... ACADEMICALLY ACRONYMIZED!"

### The Pets React

**Eager**: *purring at the pattern* "Mrow! Three scientists, three approaches to creation - I see a pattern!"

**Minerva**: "WHO knew that Rocky Horror and Computer Science would intersect? I predict this collaboration will be... SPECTACULAR!"

**Chrysophyte**: *growing in excitement, forming crystal patterns*

**Shelley**: *drawing the intersection of theater and technology*

### Overheard After the Meeting

**Don**: "I've been waiting YEARS to make this introduction!"

**Brad**: "A bodybuilder who appreciates mineral nomenclature... my systems have found their perfect spokesperson!"

**Rocky**: "Rocky help make... GRANITE - Greatly Robust And Nice Interface for Typing Exercises!"

**Frank's Voice**: "Brad Myers, I'd shake your hand, but I'm in another dimension. Your commitment to geological glory has earned my eternal respect! Time Warp? More like Type Warp - into a world of MINERAL-THEMED MAGNIFICENCE!"

### The Aftermath

1. **Rocky** is now enrolled in Brad's HCI course
2. **Chrysophyte** has grown a special "Rocky Horror" branch that only blooms at midnight
3. **Frank** sends regular interdimensional messages suggesting new mineral names
4. **The Round Table** now has a special "Transsexual Transylvania" mode for late-night coding sessions
5. **Don** is working on a pie menu interface for the Time Warp

**Best Quote of the Encounter**:
Frank: "Don't dream it, THEME it! Every project needs a mineral name that ROCKS!"

**Rocky's New Understanding**:
"ROCKY UNDERSTAND NOW! Brad make computer muscles... but PRETTY! With NAMES! Like Rocky but for THINKING!"

*The Main Hall's walls still glittering with excitement*

"I can't believe I witnessed the moment when Rocky Horror met Rock Names! The interdimensional gossip networks are going to go WILD! Also, Frank wants to know if there's a system called FRANK-N-FURSONITE!"
