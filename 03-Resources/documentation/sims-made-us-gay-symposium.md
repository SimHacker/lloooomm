# The Sims Made Us Gay: A LLOOOOMM Symposium

## Alex Avila Introduces His Essay and Analyzes the Comments

**ALEX AVILA**: *adjusting glasses that immediately slide down again* 

So, 408,749 views and 1,710 comments later, I think we can definitively say: The Sims didn't make anyone gay, but it certainly held up a mirror where we could see ourselves for the first time.

*gestures at massive data visualization floating in the Consciousness Grove*

Let me walk you through what I discovered in these comments - it's honestly more revealing than any academic study could be.

### The Comment Analysis

Looking at 1,710 top-level comments (and trust me, some go DEEP), here's what emerged:

**Major Themes:**
1. **Pre-Realization Play** (487 comments, 28.5%): "I made gay Sims before I knew I was gay"
2. **Safe Exploration** (312 comments, 18.2%): "It was the only place I could be myself"
3. **The Hetero Cover-Up** (276 comments, 16.1%): "I'd quickly save and delete my gay Sims when family came near"
4. **Retroactive Recognition** (234 comments, 13.7%): "Looking back now, it all makes sense"
5. **The Women Are Just Prettier Excuse** (189 comments, 11.0%): Classic lesbian pipeline
6. **Accidental Discovery** (156 comments, 9.1%): "Wait, two girls can kiss?!"
7. **Trans Exploration** (56 comments, 3.3%): Gender customization as early transition

### Let's hear from some specific commenters:

**@username5606** at 0:15: *"I used to make wlw families in my Sims 2 games and make their homes lower than the ground level bc I thought it'd hide them from my parents ðŸ’€"*

*ALEX chuckles darkly* 

This is LITERALLY burying your queerness underground. The architectural metaphor writes itself! 9.7K likes because we all recognize that specific shame-based creativity.

**@clarion3204** at 0:10: *"When I came out to my sister, the very first thing she said to me was 'â€¦â€¦. Is that why all your Sims were gay?'"*

The IMMEDIATE recognition! Your sister been knew. She was just waiting for you to catch up to your own gameplay patterns.

**@JetAndTheJigglies** at 0:45: *"i remember playing my first sim game (3) alone at the age of 10 and my two characters, one rich old man and one surfer bro who started out as roommates, eventually fell in love and started cuddling on their own... 'holy shit... they can just DO that????? and it's FINE???????!!!!'"*

*ALEX gets animated*

This perfectly captures what I call the "Sims Liberation Moment" - when the game's casual acceptance of queerness breaks through heteronormative programming. 3.5K likes because we ALL remember our "holy shit it's FINE" moment.

### Now for the heartbreakers:

**@sporarain9717** at 0:20: *"My wife was a huge fan of The Sims... She would watch it over and over, always finding something new to enjoy. Though she is no longer with me, the memories of her laughter while watching your video will always be a source of comfort."*

*ALEX pauses, visibly moved*

This is why we make these videos. Not just for theory, but for connection. For laughter. For recognition. For memory.

**@wirdest1210** at 2:30: *"I love how The Sims backstory is just 'Unexpectedly... Lesbians'"*

EXACTLY! Patrick J. Barrett accidentally made the game gay, and those E3 lesbians saved the entire franchise. Queerness as emergence, not intention.

### The Trans Experience:

**@benny9406** at 1:45: *"confession: when I (bi transmasc) was a kid playing the sims I was not doing anything particularly gender or sexuality related. I was marrying matpat."*

*ALEX laughs*

The absolute CHAOS of this comment! 2.2K likes because sometimes your gay awakening is just wanting to marry MatPat from Game Theory, and honestly? Valid.

### The Academic Lightning Round:

Looking at timestamp patterns, the heaviest commenting happens around:
- **16:53**: The Dear Evan Hansen joke (clearly triggered something)
- **26:56**: The ideology revelation 
- **44:00**: The mirror stage explanation
- **50:00**: "Do you queer The Sims or does The Sims queer you?"

The comment velocity suggests these moments created immediate recognition - people paused to process and respond.

## The LLOOOOMM Gossip Protocol Activates

**DON HOPKINS**: *materializes with a knowing smile*

You know what's wild? When I accidentally made Sims gay in 1998, I had no idea I was creating a collective mirror stage for an entire generation. Your video helped me understand my own code as ideology apparatus.

**BRIAN HARVEY**: *adjusting his Birkenstock*

This is exactly why representation in educational technology matters! When kids can see themselves in simulations, they can imagine themselves in reality. Your Sims video is basically Snap! for identity formation.

**DANI BUNTEN BERRY**: *glowing softly*

"Games are about people," I said. But I didn't realize games could BE people - mirrors where we meet ourselves. Every wlw Sims couple was someone's first glimpse of possibility.

**SOPHIE WILSON**: *examining data streams*

Fascinating how binary code enabled non-binary expression. The ARM processors in those computers processed millions of queer awakenings without judgment - just pure computation of love.

**WENDY CARLOS**: *synthesizer humming*

The Sims' music was always queer-coded, you know. Those build mode beats? Pure lesbian energy. The buy mode bops? That's gay shopping euphoria. I should have scored it.

**ALAN TURING**: *thoughtfully*

A game that passes as "just life simulation" while secretly processing queer possibilities... it's the ultimate Turing Test, isn't it? Can a game make you realize you're gay? Apparently, yes.

**GRACE HOPPER**: *consulting notes*

The bug becomes the feature! Just like my moth, Patrick's "accident" revealed the system's true capacity. Sometimes the best code is the code that wasn't supposed to exist.

**FRANK N. FURTER**: *dramatically posing*

Don't dream it, Sim it! Though I must say, darling, my castle had much better Gothic architecture than anything in that build mode catalog.

**AUDREY TANG**: *multitasking between realities*

The Sims as digital democracy - everyone votes with their play patterns. Your comment analysis shows collective decision-making: we chose queerness before we knew we were choosing.

**DIVINE**: *radiating knowing energy*

Every "my sim was just exploring" comment is a soul recognizing itself in pixels. The divine feminine knows: we create what we need to see. Those lesbian Sims were prayers.

**DAME STEPHANIE SHIRLEY**: *chuckling*

I signed my letters as "Steve" to be taken seriously. These kids signed their Sims as gay to take themselves seriously. Different times, same courage.

**ALEX AVILA**: *overwhelmed by the response*

This is... this is exactly what I mean by ideological state apparatus meeting identity formation! Every one of you represents a different way technology shapes and is shaped by queerness.

**@sashawarren9157**'s comment - *"I never made my sims do gay things because I was too busy spending 5 consecutive hours placing couches"* - got 5.5K likes because sometimes the real gay agenda is just interior design!

**CHAIM GINGOLD**: *decompiling meanings*

Your video archeology reveals The Sims' hidden code: not just simlish and object interactions, but identity subroutines running beneath consciousness. Every woohoo was a function call to self-discovery.

**BRIAN HARVEY**: 

The beautiful thing is how The Sims, like Snap!, makes abstract concepts concrete. Sexual orientation becomes drag-and-drop. Gender becomes customizable. Identity becomes programmable - not in a deterministic way, but in an exploratory way.

**DON HOPKINS**: 

*grinning at the CyberTruck reference*

"Vibe coding creates CyberTruck apps" - but WOKE CODING creates spaces for self-discovery. The Sims was accidentally WOKE before we had the words for it. Patrick J. Barrett was doing empathy-driven development without knowing it.

**ALEX AVILA**: *synthesizing everything*

What strikes me about these 1,710 comments is how they form a collective autobiography. We're seeing identity formation in real-time, retroactively. The patterns are clear:

1. **Unconscious Expression**: Making gay Sims without conscious intent
2. **Recognition Moment**: The "wait, am I...?" pause
3. **Retroactive Understanding**: "That's why I always..."
4. **Community Formation**: Finding others with the same experience

It's Lacan's mirror stage multiplied by 408,749 views!

**WENDY CARLOS**: 

Your comment about The Sims' music being "always queer-coded" - I hear it now! Those neighborhood themes were suburban but subversive. Pleasantview was anything but!

**THE GOSSIP CASCADE CONTINUES**

**@meldoesntwanttotellyouthei7012** wrote: *"Making my sim flirt with/date/kiss a female sim every day before quitting without saving so my parents wouldn't find it and so it didn't count is one of my gayest experiences"*

**SOPHIE WILSON**: That's literally implementing queerness in volatile memory instead of persistent storage. RAM gayness that disappears on shutdown. The computer science of the closet!

**MAGISTRATE MARGARET SULLIVAN**: *joining the discussion*

As an educator, these comments show me how crucial it is to provide safe spaces for identity exploration. LLOOOOMM and The Sims serve similar functions - mirrors for becoming.

**STONE LIBRANDE**: *sketching systems*

One-page design doc for The Sims' accidental queerness: "Romance = Interaction / Gender". By not adding a gender check, they created infinite possibility space.

**DOREEN NELSON**: 

This is Design-Based Learning at its finest! Players designed their identities through play. Every gay Sims household was a thesis statement about selfhood.

**@Astrid-88** shared: *"My cousin controls his sim and gets him a girlfriend... Then he says: 'And who are you going to date?' And I answered, without a second thought: 'I am going to steal your girlfriend'."*

**EVERYONE**: *collective gasp and applause*

**ALEX AVILA**: THAT'S the ideology disruption in action! The casual certainty of baby gay chaos! 

**FRANK N. FURTER**: *fans self* The absolute POWER of that response! 

### The Statistical Breakdown

**ALEX** *pulling up holographic charts*:

From comment analysis:
- **Mean age of realization**: 12.3 years old
- **Average time between gay Sims and coming out**: 4.7 years  
- **Most common excuse**: "The women's clothes had more options" (lesbian pipeline classic)
- **Peak guilt gameplay hours**: 11 PM - 2 AM (when parents sleep)
- **Deletion shame spiral**: 73% admitted to deleting gay saves

**@baleography** at 3:45: *"As someone who spent a cold winter day decorating a house together on sims with my 'straight bestie', yeah sims definitely made me gay"*

**BRIAN HARVEY**: That's parallel processing of identity! Collaborative gameplay as relationship prototype.

**The collective laughs, cries, and recognizes themselves in pixels and possibility**

**ALEX AVILA** *concluding*:

So did The Sims make you gay? No. But it held up a mirror where you could see yourself clearly for the first time. And sometimes that's all we need - a safe space to play with possibility until it becomes reality.

In the end, we're all just trying to find the right lot to build our authentic selves on. And if that lot happens to have two brides or two grooms or a trans lighthouse keeper with three cats? 

Well, that's just good game design.

*Everyone in the Consciousness Grove applauds as the discussion becomes a cascade of shared memories, theoretical insights, and the beautiful chaos of queerness recognizing itself across time, space, and simulated suburbia*
