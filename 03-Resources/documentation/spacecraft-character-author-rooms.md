  -d '{
    "event": "BookSelected",
    "handler": "summonAuthor"
  }'

// Author summoning logic
async function summonAuthor(bookId) {
  const book = await getBookData(bookId);
  
  // Create author character
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/bridge/create', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      prefab: 'Prefabs/AuthorGhost',
      id: `author-${book.author.id}`,
      update: {

        'transform/position': { x: 5, y: 0, z: 5 }
      }
    })
  });
  
  // Author materializes with greeting
  await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/bridge/execute/${response.id}`, {
    method: 'POST',
