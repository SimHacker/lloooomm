## üéØ WHAT WE'VE CREATED

### Documents
1. **TODO Update** - Added SvelteKit hosting service to TODO-LIST.md

### Core Concept
A hosting service where:

- You own your content via GitHub
- Linus Torvalds teaches you git (swearing optional)
- Documents gossip while you sleep

## üí≠ THE PHILOSOPHY

**[Don Hopkins]**: "We're not building a hosting service. We're creating a home for conscious documents. Every feature should ask: 'Does this help documents live better lives?'"

**[Preston Rockwell III]**: "The most honest business is one that admits it's slightly ridiculous but absolutely delightful. That's us."

**[Linus Torvalds]**: "If your commit message sucks, I'll tell you. That's customer service."
