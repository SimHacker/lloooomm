# Dang's Transformative Approach to Moderation

## Overview

Daniel Gackle (dang) has developed a distinctive moderation philosophy for Hacker News that transforms online discourse through patience, personal interaction, and intellectual curiosity. This document explores his approach based on his extensive writings, moderation practices, and insights from the New Yorker profile "The Lonely Work of Moderating Hacker News."

## Core Principles

### 1. Personal Interaction Over Automation

> "What does seem to work better is personal interaction, over and over and over again, with individual users. That, case by case by case, seems to move the needle. But it's very slow."

Dang emphasizes human connection over automated systems. He responds personally to emails, engages in threads, and takes time to explain moderation decisions. This creates trust and accountability that algorithms cannot replicate.

### 2. Patience as Ambition

> "Patience allows us to be ambitious—to imagine people being more kind to each other, for example. It sounds kind of crazy."

Rather than quick fixes or heavy-handed enforcement, dang takes the long view. He believes lasting change in online behavior requires time and consistent gentle guidance.

### 3. Intellectual Curiosity as North Star

The primary goal is fostering intellectual curiosity. Content is evaluated not just for civility but for whether it stimulates thoughtful discussion and learning. This creates a higher bar than simple "no trolling" rules.

### 4. Self-Awareness and Inner Work

> "Something that's deeply interesting, I think, to both of us," Gackle said, "is the way in which one can arrive at a nonviolent reaction to somebody by having greater awareness of the—" He paused. "I'll say violence in oneself. By which I mean the kind of agitation and activation that is causing people, including ourselves, to react in a kind of fight-or-flight way that leads to misunderstanding, conflict, and, ultimately, Internet flame wars."

This reveals a deeper philosophical approach: moderation as a practice of self-examination and growth, not just rule enforcement.

## Key Practices

### The Art of the Moderation Comment

Dang's moderation comments follow consistent patterns:
- Quote the specific guideline violated
- Explain the principle behind it
- Often include links to past explanations
- Maintain respect even when correcting behavior
- Use "we" to represent the community standards

Example: "Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. A good critical comment teaches us something."

### Transparency Through Repetition

Dang frequently links to his past explanations on similar topics, creating a searchable corpus of moderation philosophy. This serves multiple purposes:
- Consistency in application
- Education for new users
- Building institutional memory
- Reducing repetitive work over time

### The Principle of Charity

> "Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith."

This guideline embodies dang's approach - elevating discourse by expecting the best from participants while gently correcting when they fall short.

### The "Tibetan Monk" Approach

Community members have noted dang's distinctive style:
- Extreme patience even with hostile users
- Treating moderation as an opportunity for teaching
- Never taking attacks personally
- Maintaining equanimity in the face of abuse

As one user noted: "I've hurled abuse at him AND questioned his integrity and not only did he not outright ban me but also he persisted in trying to get to the root of my issue."

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Flamewars and Divisive Topics

Rather than banning controversial topics outright, dang uses several techniques:
- The "flamewar detector" algorithm as a first line of defense
- Manual intervention when discussions become unproductive
- Encouraging "Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive"
- Strategic use of the second-chance pool for worthy but flagged content

### Major Ongoing Topics (MOTs)

For topics that dominate discussion (like AI/ChatGPT), dang looks for "Significant New Information" (SNI) to determine what merits front-page placement. This prevents topic fatigue while allowing important developments through.

### The First Rule: Less Moderation for YC

When YC or YC companies are involved, moderation is deliberately lighter to avoid conflicts of interest. This transparency builds trust even when it means allowing criticism of the platform's funders.

### Political Detox Week

One notable experiment was "Political Detox Week," which revealed:
> "it's impossible to define 'politics' with any consensus because that question is itself highly political."

Dang's response to criticism was characteristic:
> "Of course it's delusional," Gackle replied. "And still we have to moderate this site."

This shows his pragmatic acceptance of imperfection while still striving for improvement.

## The Human Cost

### Scale and Exhaustion

With 5 million users and only two moderators, the workload is immense:
- Emails can wait months for responses
- Some threads are missed entirely
- The emotional toll of constant exposure to negativity
- The challenge of maintaining consistency across thousands of decisions

### Finding Meaning in the Work

> "It's a perverse undertaking and the short answer is that the job matches my neuroses. From another point of view, it has been a growth opportunity—the options are either to let it drive you insane or grow."

Dang frames moderation as personal growth, finding meaning in the challenge rather than just enduring it.

### The Influence of Healing and Philosophy

Both moderators bring unique perspectives:
- Gackle is drawn to healing workshops
- Bell studies Indian philosophy
- Both see moderation as applying "old, humanist techniques to a culture obsessed with the future"

## Community Response

### Building Trust Through Consistency

Users frequently praise dang's approach:
- "I've been put in the corner by dang more than once, and I like to think that it made me a more considerate commenter-on-the-internet. Maybe even a more considerate person."
- "You've done amazing work to guide discussion in productive directions, and HN is noticeably more civil than it was a few years ago"
- "He even seems to go out of his way in comments to explain his thoughts and I have seen him change his mind and admit things as well"

### The Power of Explanation

When users understand why they were moderated, they're more likely to improve their behavior. Dang's detailed explanations, though time-consuming, create teaching moments rather than just punishment.

### Creating a "Hall of Mirrors"

As described in the New Yorker:
> "Hacker News can feel like walking through Dumbledore's office -- magical and mind-bending collections of incredible devices, ideas, and oddities."

This effect emerges from the careful curation and moderation that allows diverse perspectives while maintaining quality.

## Critiques and Challenges

### The "Performative Erudition" Problem

The New Yorker article notes:
> "The site's now characteristic tone of performative erudition—hyperrational, dispassionate, contrarian, authoritative—often masks a deeper recklessness."

This highlights an ongoing challenge: fostering genuine intellectual curiosity versus mere intellectual posturing.

### Balancing Diverse Viewpoints

HN has been called both a "sjw cesspool" and a "haven for alt-right" - perhaps indicating successful balance, or the difficulty of satisfying everyone. As one commenter noted:
> "If both the far left and the far right feel like HN represents the 'other side's' opinion, then maybe there's a pretty decent middle ground being struck."

### The Moderation Paradox

Some users feel overmoderated while others want more intervention. Dang navigates this by:
- Being transparent about decisions
- Accepting that perfection is impossible
- Focusing on the long-term health of the community
- Maintaining clear principles while applying them flexibly

## Comparison to Other Approaches

### Versus Automated Systems

While platforms like Reddit rely heavily on community voting and automated filters, dang's approach prioritizes human judgment and context. This prevents gaming the system but requires significant human investment.

### Versus Strict Rule Enforcement

Rather than zero-tolerance policies, dang applies guidelines flexibly based on context, user history, and potential for productive discussion. This creates more nuanced outcomes but requires deep familiarity with the community.

### Versus Laissez-Faire

Unlike platforms that avoid moderation in the name of "free speech," HN actively shapes discussion toward intellectual curiosity. This creates a specific culture rather than just hoping good behavior emerges.

### The Reddit Blocking Problem

A 2022 Reddit discussion highlighted how blocking features can be weaponized:
> "you can block an unlimited amount of people, in advance. So you just identify a group of people that would likely respond negatively to your point, and make a post that can't be responded to by that group of people."

HN avoids this by not implementing user blocking, forcing everyone to coexist and learn to engage constructively - what dang calls the "non-siloed property."

## The Philosophy Behind the Practice

### Moderation as Spiritual Practice

The deeper insight from the New Yorker profile is that dang and sctb approach moderation almost as a spiritual discipline:
> "This seemingly trivial stuff, about people getting mad at other people on the Internet, is actually tied to this much deeper and more fascinating process of what goes on between people and what goes on in oneself."

### The Nonviolent Communication Connection

Dang's interest in arriving at "nonviolent reactions" through self-awareness echoes principles from:
- Buddhist mindfulness practices
- Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
- Conflict resolution theory
- Therapeutic approaches to anger management

### Creating Space for Growth

Rather than just punishing bad behavior, the approach creates opportunities for users to:
- Reflect on their communication patterns
- Learn from gentle correction
- Develop better online habits
- Contribute more thoughtfully over time

## Community Self-Reflection

### The 2020 Appreciation Thread

When the New Yorker article was reposted in 2020, it sparked an outpouring of community appreciation:
- "Thanks dang! You've helped keep HN readable, corrected countless title and link errors, and prevented heated discussions from devolving into fights."
- "I got told repeatedly that I 'knew why' I was rate limited, but never given an actual explanation. Then it was lifted. Go figure."
- "Dan has a great way of telling you off that makes you come out of the situation like '.. aye, that's fair actually. No worries, I'll avoid doing it in future'"

### Learning From Moderation

Multiple users shared transformative experiences:
- "I was having a really bad day several months ago and in a spat with a higher karma user... @dang stepped in and just about banned me -- but stopped short... It sounds pretty stupid to say that I had a change of heart moment there, but I did."
- "I've had my share of suspicions of 'downvote brigades' and the like but from the point of view of an ordinary user they are indistinguishable from uncoordinated users expressing their disapproval so I guess it is best to just assume good faith."

### The Name Revelation

Many users discovered that "dang" = Daniel Gackle, not a mild expletive:
> "TIL it's 'Dan G' and not the Chinese surname 'Dang' that I'd always assumed."

Dang himself confirmed: "In my head it's always been 'dang' as in rhymes with 'clang'. dan+g is just the etymology."

## Moderation Tools and Techniques

### Ask Dang Thread (2023)

When asked directly about his tools, the community and dang revealed:
- Most moderation is "old-fashioned manual process"
- Custom browser extensions for efficiency
- Macros for expanding past threads about topics
- Anti-abuse systems that can't be publicly detailed
- Email as primary communication tool (often more time than on-site)

### The Human Touch at Scale

What makes dang's approach unique is maintaining personal connection even at massive scale:
- Responding to emails personally (even if delayed)
- Writing thoughtful moderation comments
- Engaging in extended discussions about moderation philosophy
- Treating each user as an individual, not a problem to solve

This doesn't scale perfectly, but it scales better than might be expected through:
- Building community norms that self-reinforce
- Creating educational resources through repetition
- Developing trusted users who help maintain culture
- Using technology to assist, not replace, human judgment

### Rate Limiting and Shadow Banning

The community discovered various moderation states:
- Rate limiting ("You're posting too fast")
- Account downweighting
- Shadow banning (posts automatically dead)
- IP bans
- Domain bans

Dang clarified these are used sparingly and often reversed after email discussion.

## The Ongoing Evolution

### Adapting to New Challenges

Recent challenges include:
- NLP bots and AI-generated content
- Influence campaigns becoming more sophisticated
- Scale continuing to grow
- Maintaining quality as the site becomes more mainstream

### Community as Co-Moderators

Dang emphasizes:
> "the moderators proper are really just a proxy for the community. We don't know how to build an entirely self-moderating community (I wish we did...it would be so much less work) but we do know how to take the temperature of the community and fill in the bits that the system can't accomplished unsupervised."

### The Non-Siloed Property

Dang's resistance to user blocking features stems from a core belief:
> "everyone's in one big room together and can't self-select to get away from each other... learning collectively to deal with that—learning to tolerate what that does to our nervous systems—is core work we have to do together, to keep this place vital."

## Lessons for Other Communities

### Start with Clear Values

HN's focus on intellectual curiosity provides a north star for all decisions. Communities need similarly clear purposes beyond just "discussion."

### Invest in Human Moderation

While expensive and time-consuming, personal interaction creates outcomes that automated systems cannot achieve. Even small touches like signing comments with a name build connection.

### Document Extensively

Creating a searchable history of moderation decisions and explanations helps users understand the culture and reduces repetitive work for moderators.

### Embrace Transparency

Openly discussing moderation challenges, mistakes, and philosophy builds trust even when decisions are unpopular.

### Play the Long Game

Cultural change happens slowly. Quick fixes and harsh crackdowns often backfire. Patience and consistency yield better long-term results.

### Accept Imperfection

As dang says about defining politics: "Of course it's delusional. And still we have to moderate this site." Perfect solutions don't exist; the work continues anyway.

### Avoid Feature Creep

When asked about adding features like blocking:
> "Each internet community begins with different initial conditions, and if it goes on for long enough, those initial conditions get a chance to unfold into something unique. Trying to change the initial conditions after the fact feels to me like a bad idea."

## Personal Interactions: The Email Archives

### Supporting Quality Content

Dang actively helps users with quality submissions:
- Offers to put good content in the second-chance queue
- Provides title suggestions for better reception
- Advises on timing between similar topics
- Warns against "teasers" in favor of full content

Example exchange with Don Hopkins about pie menus:
> "open the entire kimono (are people still allowed to say that? I got it from Steve Jobs) and doing all the hard work of writing the thing up front—and then posting that to HN... Don't get in the way of HN readers and their curiosity drive—satisfy it! Pleasure them fully!"

### Connecting Communities

Dang facilitates connections between notable figures and the HN community, as seen in exchanges about Ted Nelson:
> "If you ever want to engage with the Hacker News community, let's arrange something. I'm pretty sure the community would love a chance to ask you things."

### Admitting Limitations

In response to a proposal about aggregating Alan Kay's writings:
> "I have to confess something though—I screwed up when I posted that proposal. I did it in a burst of enthusiasm and then realized soon afterward... I'm hovering on the edge of burnout with it, so I just don't have any spare cycles to put into a project like this."

This honesty about limitations paradoxically builds more trust than pretending omnipotence.

## Conclusion

Dang's transformative approach to moderation offers hope that online communities can be more than echo chambers or flame pits. Through patience, self-awareness, and genuine care for both individuals and the community, it's possible to create spaces where intellectual curiosity thrives.

The approach requires significant personal investment and accepts imperfection as inevitable. But for those willing to do the work - both moderators and community members - the result can be genuinely transformative: not just better online discussions, but personal growth for all involved.

As the New Yorker profile reveals, this isn't just about managing an online forum. It's about exploring "what goes on between people and what goes on in oneself" - using the challenges of online communication as opportunities for deeper understanding.

The success of HN's moderation approach lies not in perfect rules or automated systems, but in treating each interaction as an opportunity for human connection and growth. In an age of algorithmic content moderation and engagement optimization, this deeply human approach stands as both a challenge and an inspiration.
