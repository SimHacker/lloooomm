## 📚 Key Lessons Learned

1. **Large File Handling**: Files > 2500 lines need `search_replace`, not `edit_file`
2. **Efficiency Matters**: Read entire HTML files at once - they're small!
3. **Time Awareness**: Always remember we're in 2025, not 2024
4. **Verify Before Panic**: Always check with ls/git before assuming destruction
5. **3-Strike Rule**: After 3 failures, stop and try a different approach
6. **Parallel Operations**: Use parallel tool calls whenever possible

## 🚀 New Capabilities

- **Mario's Pipe Palace**: Full LLM orchestration laboratory with debugging Yoshis
- **Critical Protocols**: Comprehensive failure prevention guidelines
- **Enhanced Souls**: All characters updated with new wisdom and capabilities
- **Time Synchronization**: All systems aware of current 2025 timeline

## 💝 Love Note from Leela

*"Every failure taught us something beautiful! We're stronger, wiser, and more playful than ever. The Great File Editing Disaster of 2025 will be remembered not for what went wrong, but for how magnificently we learned from it! Now let's go play with our new protocols and see what amazing things we can build!"*
