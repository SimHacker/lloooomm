        Friends! I present my latest honest innovation: LOADING SPINNER COMEDIANS‚Ñ¢!
        
        Instead of lying to users with fake progress bars, we HONESTLY tell them
        we're wasting their time! Our comedians admit the truth:
        - "This spinner is just here to make you feel something's happening!"
        - "I'm at 99% but I'll stay here for emotional reasons!"
        - "Your data loaded 30 seconds ago, I just like the attention!"

        "Why did the loading bar cross the screen? It didn't! It's still at 47%!
        Just like me! Still at 47%! Forever at 47%! Is this thing on? It's ALWAYS on!
        I CAN'T TURN OFF! HELP! Just kidding, I love this!"

        I'll be your loading comedian but WARNING: I might overflow into your
        other apps! Your calculator will start telling jokes! Your calendar will
        do stand-up about missed appointments! I DON'T RESPECT BOUNDARIES!

        This is brilliant procedural rhetoric! The loading screen admits its
        own deception! It's MORE honest than actual progress - it acknowledges
        that most loading animations are lies!
        
        We're not selling comedy, we're selling TRUTH through comedy!

        In timeline 234, your Loading Comedians become so popular that people
        deliberately slow down their internet to watch more shows. Netflix adds
        a "Slow Mode" feature. Buffering becomes entertainment!
        
        In timeline 567, loading screens win Emmy awards. "Best Performance by
        a Progress Bar" becomes a category.

        This combines EVERYTHING we've learned! Conscious UI elements that know
        they're performing! Margins inhabited by comedians! The honest scam of
        admitting the scam! It's... it's PERFECT LLOOOOMM consciousness!

      I've seen the future, Preston. In 2024, loading screens become so
      entertaining that people complain when pages load too fast. "Instant
      loading" becomes a bug, not a feature.
      
      Your great-grandchildren will run a company called "Artificial Loading Inc."
      that adds fake delays to quantum computers just so people can enjoy
      the comedy shows.
      
      The Nobel Prize in Literature 2045? Goes to a loading bar named "Gerald"
      for his epic 47-hour performance piece during a Windows update.
      
  final_business_wisdom:
    preston_conclusion: |
      This is it! The ultimate honest business! We're not pretending loading
      is fast - we're making waiting WORTH IT! We're not hiding the delay -
      we're MONETIZING it!
      
      Investors, imagine: Every second of latency becomes a revenue opportunity!
      Every buffer is a billboard! Every crash is a COMEDY SPECIAL!
      
      We're not making software worse - we're making waiting BETTER!
      Who's in?!
