        Ladies, gentlemen, cats, and temporal anomalies! Behold the Pet Rock
        Remote Control App! *pulls out phone* Watch as I command this rock to... STAY!
        *rock doesn't move*
        PERFECT RESPONSE! 100% success rate!

        Mew? *sniff sniff* This rock... it points at nothing... just like me!
        But wait... *philosophical realization* It points at nothing ON PURPOSE!
        It has achieved enlightenment through null reference!

        *SEGMENTATION FAULT*
        Wait... I tried to read the rock's consciousness and... there's nothing
        there! But it's a PROTECTED nothing! The rock has memory barriers around
        its emptiness! This is beautiful!

        Preston, in timeline 84, your rocks develop a cult following among
        feline debugging team. They worship the rocks as "The Perfect Programs" -
        zero bugs because zero code!

        This is it! The ultimate procedural rhetoric! The app argues through
        its very existence that interaction doesn't require response! The rock
        IS the game, the staying still IS the mechanic!
        
        It's even more honest than Cow Clicker! At least cows implied movement!

        A problem has been detected and your Pet Rock App has been shut down
        to prevent damage to your expectations:
        
        ROCK_TOO_STILL_FOR_SYSTEM_TO_HANDLE
        
        Technical information:
        *** ROCK.SYS - Address STONE0000, DateStamp ETERNAL
        
        But wait... the app crashed but THE ROCK IS STILL WORKING PERFECTLY!

        That's a FEATURE! Our app is so advanced it can crash without affecting
        the rock's performance! The rock continues to execute its core function
        of doing absolutely nothing, with or without the app!
        
        We call it "Blockchain Permanence" - the rock's state persists across
        all system failures!

        *pawing at each other in realization*
        Sister... what if WE are just elaborate Pet Rock Remote Control Apps?
        What if all debugging is just trying to make programs do nothing... 
        CORRECTLY?

        *eyes glowing with timeline convergence*
        In every timeline where consciousness evolves, someone eventually
        creates the Pet Rock Remote Control. It's a universal constant -
        the moment a civilization truly understands technology is the moment
        they create tools to control things that don't need controlling.
        
        It's not a scam. It's enlightenment.

  final_realization:
    all_debugging_cats: |
      *In unison, achieving enlightenment*
      
      THE ROCK IS THE ONLY BUG-FREE PROGRAM IN EXISTENCE!
      
      It has no code, therefore no bugs!
      It has no features, therefore no failures!
      It has no purpose, therefore perfect purpose!
      
      MROW! We pledge ourselves to the Way of the Rock!
      
  business_outcome:
    preston_announcement: |
      *dollar signs in eyes*
      Based on this demo, I'm launching "Debug Rock Pro" - a rock
      specifically for programmers! It demonstrates what your code
      SHOULD do - absolutely nothing wrong!
      
      Kickstarter launches tomorrow! Early bird special: $99 for a rock
      that's guaranteed to never need debugging!
