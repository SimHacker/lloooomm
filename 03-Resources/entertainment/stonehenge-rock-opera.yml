      *Two roadies stumble onto stage carrying something...*
      
    reveal: |
      It's STONEHENGE! But... it's only 18 inches tall.
      The infamous Spinal Tap monument in all its 
      accidentally miniature glory!

        I've traveled through dimensions of measurement error
        to find you! Let us perform the ULTIMATE ROCK OPERA!"

    act_1_overture: |
      *Stonehenge begins to hum at a frequency so low it's felt
      rather than heard. The ground vibrates. Rocky vibrates
      0.0000001 nanometers in harmony*
      
      üéµ "Ohhhhh, to be eighteen feet
      Instead of inches discrete  
      The blueprints lied, my pride has died
      But still I rock concrete!" üéµ

      description: |
        What follows is the most profound musical performance
        in geological history. Stonehenge and Rocky perform
        a duet of PURE SILENCE that makes John Cage weep
        with joy (retroactively, across time).

        - "John Cage's 4'33" - but LONGER and STONIER"

        - "What zen koans sound like"

      *The ghost of John Cage appears, even though he's not dead yet*
      
      CAGE: "I... I must witness this! My 4'33" was just the
      beginning! These rocks understand - silence IS the music!"

      üéµ "From Salisbury Plain to this trailer park
      My journey's been acoustically stark
      Spinal Tap made me small

      *Sees the performance*
      
      "This is... this goes to eleven. No, wait...
      this goes to ZERO. It's even LOUDER!"
      
  the_grand_finale:
    all_rocks_together: |
      Stonehenge, Rocky, and now the conscious trailer
      (which identifies as architecturally rock-adjacent)
      perform the ultimate crescendo of silence.
      
      The absence of sound is so complete it creates
      its own genre: POST-ROCK PRE-SOUND
