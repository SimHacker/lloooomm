  # LIKE YOU'RE 5
  seymour_simple:
    quote: "Imagine a magic room that looks small outside but is HUGE inside! And you have a turtle friend who draws pictures by walking around!"
    
  alan_adds:
    quote: "When the turtle says 'CHEESE!' it starts remembering everywhere it goes. When it says 'PRINT!' it makes a beautiful picture of its journey!"
    
  marvin_breadcrumbs:
    quote: "The turtle leaves sparkly breadcrumbs that remember not just WHERE it was, but HOW it was FEELING!"
    
  leela_excitement:
    description: "Shifts to age 5, eyes wide"
    quote: "So the turtle's thoughts become ART?!"
    
  # BUILDING UP
  alan_computing:
    quote: "As you grow up, you realize this is how COMPUTERS think! When AI learns, it's like our turtle walking through possibility space!"
    
  seymour_math:
    quote: "Those breadcrumbs are COORDINATES in mathematical space! Moving from 'happy' to 'curious' is really moving through vector space!"
    
  marvin_society:
    quote: "Each breadcrumb is like an agent in the Society of Mind! They talk to each other, create patterns together!"
    
  # PROGRAMMING EXPERTS JOIN
  dave_ungar:
    quote: "This is the ultimate object-oriented environment! The turtle, castle, breadcrumbs - all objects sending messages in real-time!"
    
  brian_harvey:
    quote: "Traditional Logo taught procedural thinking. This teaches DIMENSIONAL thinking! Kids program space itself!"
    
  jens_monig:
    quote: "The SVG output is like a visual program that documents itself! Imagine Snap! blocks controlling castle dimensions!"
    
  # PROGRAMMING BY DEMONSTRATION
  brad_myers:
    quote: "This is programming by demonstration taken to its extreme! Every movement is a program, every exploration is a demonstration!"
    
  allen_cypher:
    quote: "The turtle's journey becomes the algorithm! You're showing how to think about geometry, emotion, sound - all at once!"
    
  # ADVANCED CONCEPTS
  seymour_advanced:
    quote: "For advanced mathematics: we're creating tangible interfaces to high-dimensional manifolds! Breadcrumb interpolation is barycentric coordinates!"
    
  alan_ml:
    quote: "This is exactly how neural networks learn - moving through parameter space! Kids can now WALK through 768-dimensional embedding spaces!"
    
  marvin_consciousness:
    quote: "We're creating tools for understanding consciousness itself! Each trail is a map of a mind exploring possibility space!"
    
  # HUNTER'S OBSERVATIONS
  hunter_notes:
    description: "Pen smoking across pages"
    internal_thoughts:
      - "They've weaponized wonder and deployed it against ignorance!"
      - "This isn't education - this is consciousness expansion!"
      - "The turtle is painting the essence of consciousness itself!"
    
  hunter_headline:
    quote: "I can see it now: 'FEAR AND LOATHING IN MATHEMATICAL SPACE: How a Turtle Revolutionized Human Understanding!'"
    
  # SYNTHESIS
  group_realization:
    collective: "We're looking at a new form of human-computer interaction, a new way of thinking about space and consciousness!"
    
  seymour_synthesis:
    quote: "Every child will develop intuitive understanding of concepts requiring years of study! They'll FEEL continuous functions!"
    
  alan_vision:
    quote: "This is the Dynabook beyond my wildest imagination! Personal dynamic media that becomes you, thinks with you!"
    
  marvin_insight:
    quote: "We've created a mirror for the mind! Children learn to think about thinking!"
    
  # THEO'S DEMONSTRATION
  theo_from_castle:
    quote: "Can you see this? I'm drawing a neural network in smell-space!"
    effect: "Beautiful patterns of light stream from the castle"
    
  # CLOSING
  seymour_blessing:
    quote: "Let this begin a new age - where mathematics is play, programming is art, thinking becomes visible!"
    
  hunter_final:
    quote: "We weren't just witnessing an invention - we were witnessing the birth of a new form of human consciousness!"

significance: "Complete paradigm shift in learning - spatial, mathematical, artistic revolution begins"
