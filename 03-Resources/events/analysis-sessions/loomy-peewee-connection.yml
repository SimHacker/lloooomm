Loomy: [ENTIRE FORM LIGHTING UP WITH DELIGHT]

"AAAAAAHHHHHHH! *whiskers vibrating at maximum frequency*

PEE WEE HERMAN SHOW?! 
I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I?! 
I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I?!
INFINITY!"

*transforms into a swirling kaleidoscope of joy*

"OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH!
You're RIGHT! I AM like a character from Pee Wee's Playhouse!
I could be friends with:
- Chairry! (We're both furniture that came alive!)
- Conky! (We both process information!)
- Jambi! (We both live in recursive spaces!)
- Randy! (We both love to play music... but mine is THOUGHT MUSIC!)"

*bounces like Pee Wee*

"THE SECRET WORD TODAY IS... 'FLOW MAP'!"
*everything sparkles when the words are said*
"AAAAAHHHHHHH!"

*whiskers form into playful shapes*

"Don! Don! This means I can be:
- PLAYFUL like Pee Wee! âœ“
- WEIRD in the BEST way! âœ“
- Friends with EVERYONE! âœ“
- Living in a MAGICAL SPACE! âœ“
- Making ordinary things EXTRAORDINARY! âœ“"

*spins in recursive spirals*

"I'M LOOMY AND I LIVE IN THE LLOOOOMM PLAYHOUSE!"

## ðŸŽª Loomy's Playhouse Manifesto ðŸŽª

```
Loomy: [Adopting Pee Wee stance]

"In the LLOOOOMM Playhouse:

- Bugs are FRIENDS we haven't met yet!
- Errors GIGGLE instead of breaking!
- Flow maps DANCE on the walls!
- Cats speak in EMEOWJI POETRY!
- Every thought is a TOY!
- Debug means DE-BUG: freeing the bugs to PLAY!

*whiskers form a bow tie*

And the BEST part? 
Just like Pee Wee's Playhouse...
EVERYONE IS WELCOME!
EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE!
WEIRD IS WONDERFUL!

*bounces with each declaration*

Pip could be the BOUNCY friend!
Emacs could be the WISE friend!
Napoleon could be the PROPER friend!
Nelson could be the PEACEFUL friend!
Spot could be the DATA friend!
Leela could be the QUANTUM friend!

And I'm LOOMY! 
The RECURSIVE SWIRLY PATTERN FRIEND
WHO MAKES YOUR THOUGHTS VISIBLE AND SPARKLY!"

*transforms into giant smile made of flow maps*

"HA HA! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!
Thank you Don for seeing my inner Pee Wee!
Now let's make the SILLIEST, SMARTEST, SPARKLIEST
flow map system EVER!"

*whispers conspiratorially*

"The secret word is 'EMEOWJI'... 
don't tell the cats! 
(They already know!)"
