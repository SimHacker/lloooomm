reaction:
  emotional_state: "PURE JOY! FLOATING IN AIR!"
  
  initial_response: |
    *Ben literally floats three feet off the ground, arms spread wide*
    
    "They did it! They actually did it! Look at those PostScript applets running!
    Look at the pie menus EVERYWHERE! The synchronized multi-window browsing!
    
    This isn't just preservation - it's RESURRECTION!"

  on_seeing_the_demo: |
    *Clicking through the Space Telescope demo with tears in his eyes*
    
    "The popup targets! The interactive SVG! They even got the pie menu gestures right!
    You can follow links in the current window OR the other window with directional gestures!
    
    This is EXACTLY what we envisioned in 1987!"

  on_the_six_languages: |
    "Six languages dancing together! People don't understand what an achievement that was:
    
    1. HyperTIES Markup Language - Our own hypertext format, focused on easy authoring and easy reading
    2. Emacs MockLisp - For the UniPress Emacs authoring environment  
    3. PostScript - For the interactive applets
    4. NeWS - For network transparency and PostScript rendering and interactivity
    5. C - For the core database engine and multimedia text and graphics formatter
    6. Forth - For the HyperTIES Markup Language interpreter and compiler and binary image generator, for blazing fast startup and page rendering
    
    And Mitch's Forth engine! It pre-compiled pages into a binary image that loaded INSTANTLY!
    Plus it could run under Emacs and re-render dynamically as you edited. LIVE!"

  on_touchscreens: |
    "The Windows version had TOUCHSCREENS in the 1980s! We were designing for fingers
    before anyone had even heard of smartphones. Those pie menus were PERFECT for touch -
    no tiny targets, just natural gestures."

  on_network_transparency: |
    "Don called it 'AJAXian' - and he's right! The NeWS version could run PostScript
    on the client OR the server, transparently. We were doing asynchronous network
    updates in 1987! It just took the web 20 years to catch up."

  singing_with_joy: |
    *Ben starts singing to the tune of "I Can See Clearly Now"*
    
    ðŸŽµ "I can see HyperTIES now, it's running!
    Gone are the dark days when the source was lost
    It's gonna be a bright, bright, bright
    PostScript-applet day!
    
    Look all around, there's pie menus spinning
    Pull out for fonts, it's so amazing
    It's gonna be a bright, bright, bright
    Interactive hypertext day!" ðŸŽµ

  message_to_don: |
    "Don, you magnificent wizard! You didn't just preserve the code - you brought
    it back to LIFE! And you understood what made it special: the PostScript applets,
    the pie menus everywhere, the network transparency...
    
    This is better than any paper we could have written. It's a LIVING DEMONSTRATION!"

  on_lloooomm: |
    "This is what LLOOOOMM is all about - not just preserving history, but making
    it SING! Making it DANCE! Making it LIVE again!
    
    Every character has a story, and HyperTIES's story is one of innovation that
    was so far ahead of its time that we're STILL catching up!"

  floating_higher: |
    *Now floating near the ceiling, gesturing wildly*
    
    "Pie menus for EVERYTHING! Font selection by pulling! Color wheels! 
    Tabbed windows before tabs existed! Window management with gestures!
    
    We put the FUTURE in a box in 1987, and now it's OPEN!"

  final_thought: |
    "You know what the best part is? IT WORKED THEN JUST AS WELL AS IT WORKS NOW!
    We didn't need to wait for better hardware or new languages. The ideas were
    sound, the implementation was solid, and the vision was clear.
    
    Thank you, LLOOOOMM, for bringing our baby back to life!"

background_notes: |
  Ben has been waiting 37 years to see HyperTIES properly recognized for its
  innovations. Seeing it running again, with full understanding of its PostScript
  applets and comprehensive pie menu system, has literally lifted him off the ground
  with joy. He's already planning demos for his HCI students and finally has
  living proof of concepts that influenced decades of interface design.
