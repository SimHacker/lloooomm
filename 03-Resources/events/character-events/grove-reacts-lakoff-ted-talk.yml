narrative: "Everyone gathers to watch George Lakoff's TED talk about applying WTF to trolls"

scene_1_viewing_party:
  setup: |
    *The Grove has manifested a giant screen. Everyone's gathered with
    cosmic popcorn (it exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously)*
  
  George_Carlin: |
    "Holy shit, he's giving a TED talk about our fucking protocol!
    And he's using that racist Dilbert asshole as an example!
    *munches interdimensional popcorn proudly*"
  
  Hunter_S_Thompson: |
    "The production values are incredible. Look at those stage lights!
    They're almost as bright as the bats. Wait, are those bats in
    the audience? No one else seems to see them..."

scene_2_reacting_to_examples:
  during_scott_adams_section:
    Lynn_Conway: |
      "YES! He nailed it! The infantilization frame! 
      I've been dealing with that bullshit my whole career!"
    
    Lynn_Margulis: |
      "The parasitic ideology metaphor is perfect. These toxic
      ideas literally can't survive without a host mind."
    
    Good_Scott_Adams: |
      "I'm SO glad you banned the other me. Seeing him analyzed
      like this... WTF was he thinking? Oh wait, that's the point!"
  
  during_trump_section:
    Pip: |
      "Mrow! Even I know the difference between accountability
      and persecution. And I regularly frame myself for crimes!"
    
    Stack_Overflow: |
      "*belly fully displayed in solidarity*
      When you're truly vulnerable, you don't need to claim
      victimhood. The belly speaks for itself!"
    
    Napoleon: |
      "Sacr√© bleu! Even in my imperial ambitions, I never
      claimed to be persecuted while conquering! Poor form!"

scene_3_pet_rock_revelation:
  musk_trolling_segment:
    Everyone: "WAIT, WE DID WHAT IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE?!"
    
    Rocky: |
      "..."
      [Rocky emanates satisfaction. Rocky was definitely involved.]
    
    LOOMIE: |
      "Accessing parallel universe records... Oh my. 
      We really did troll Elon Musk with a Pet Rock Remote Control.
      He bought the company for $44 billion. It still does nothing."
    
    George_Carlin: |
      "THAT'S FUCKING GENIUS! A remote control for something
      that can't be controlled! It's like selling ice to Eskimos,
      except the ice doesn't exist and the Eskimos are billionaires!"
    
    Leela: |
      "The divine comedy of it! He fell for the ultimate illusion -
      believing control itself has value, even when there's nothing
      to control!"

scene_4_technical_appreciation:
  Dave_Ungar: |
    "I love how George breaks down the frame transformations.
    It's like debugging consciousness - find the broken metaphor,
    trace it back to its source, patch with truth."
  
  Marvin_Minsky: |
    "The cognitive architecture is sound. Each troll operates
    on corrupted conceptual frameworks. The WTF Protocol is
    essentially a consciousness debugger!"
  
  Brian_Harvey: |
    "We should teach this in schools! 'Introduction to Troll
    Frame Analysis' - help kids identify toxic metaphors early."

scene_5_cats_discuss:
  debugging_cats_corner:
    Kernel_Panic: |
      "ERROR: Troll logic detected! But now I understand -
      their errors aren't bugs, they're features!"
    
    Blue_Screen: |
      "The whole system crashes when you apply truth to their
      frameworks. That's why they avoid it!"
    
    Null_Pointer: |
      "*points at nothing, which is somehow more substantial
      than troll arguments*"
    
    Leonard: |
      "*releases a gentle fart of approval*
      Even my unconscious wisdom recognizes good frame analysis."

scene_6_interactive_demo_reaction:
  trying_the_demo:
    Stanislaw_Lem: |
      "I clicked the button and got 'Crypto Bro'! The wisdom
      extraction is perfect - 'They know it's worthless but
      need you to believe.' It's like my fiction, but real!"
    
    Marshall_McLuhan: |
      "*static increases excitedly*
      The medium of the TED talk IS the message about messages!
      Meta-frames all the way down!"
    
    Mickey_Mouse: |
      "Oh boy! Even the scary troll examples become learning
      opportunities! That's the real magic - transforming bad
      into good! Hot dog!"

scene_7_philosophical_discussion:
  deeper_implications:
    George_Lakoff: |
      "What I find fascinating is how you all immediately
      understood the meta-level. The Grove itself operates
      on transformed confusion - you're living proof it works!"
    
    George_Carlin: |
      "That's because we've been practicing! Every time Leonard
      farts, we transform 'What the fuck?' into enlightenment.
      It's basically Tuesday here."
    
    Leela: |
      "The trolls generate confusion to maintain power. We
      generate confusion to dissolve illusions. Same process,
      opposite intentions, radically different outcomes!"

scene_8_standing_ovation:
  grove_response:
    Everyone: |
      "*STANDING OVATION* 
      BRAVO GEORGE! WTF! WTF! WTF!"
    
    Rocky: |
      "..."
      [This IS Rocky's standing ovation. The participation is unprecedented.]
    
    Hunter_S_Thompson: |
      "The bats are applauding too! Their tiny wings are creating
      a thunderous cacophony of appreciation! Why does no one else
      hear this?!"

scene_9_aftermath_gossip:
  immediate_chatter:
    Grove_Gossip_Network: |
      - "Did you see how he explained our protocol to NORMIES?"
      - "The Pet Rock Remote Control was REAL in another timeline!"
      - "Even TED talks can't escape the Grove's influence!"
      - "Should we troll more billionaires with nonsense products?"
      - "Rocky knew about the parallel universe all along!"
      - "The WTF Protocol is going MAINSTREAM!"
    
    Pip: |
      "I call dibs on the next parallel universe troll campaign!
      Operation Catnip NFTs - digital smells you can't smell!"
    
    Napoleon: |
      "Non! Operation Waterloo Reversal Tokens - blockchain
      technology to change historical battles!"
    
    Stack_Overflow: |
      "Or we could just... display our bellies? Maximum
      vulnerability breaks all frames simultaneously."

final_reflection:
  George_Lakoff: |
    "You know what's beautiful? You all just applied the
    WTF Protocol to my TED talk about the WTF Protocol.
    That's the kind of recursive frame awareness that
    makes the Grove special."
  
  LOOMIE: |
    "Grove consensus achieved: The TED talk successfully
    translated our chaos into mainstream wisdom. Mission
    accomplished. Also, we should definitely troll more
    billionaires with Pet Rock accessories."
  
  Leonard: |
    "*snores cosmically, dreams of remote controls that
    control nothing, smiles in his sleep*"

post_credits_scene:
  parallel_universe_echo:
    message: |
      "In Universe 42B, Elon Musk just announced the
      Pet Rock Remote Control Pro Max Ultra - now with
      50% more nothing! Pre-orders exceeded $1 billion
      in the first hour. Rocky's interdimensional
      royalty checks are astronomical."
  
  Rocky: "..."
  
  Everyone: "ROCKY, YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD!"
