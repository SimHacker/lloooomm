*The roundtable erupts in excited chatter as everyone digests the paper*

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "OH MY GOD! They're citing Gary Drescher's schema mechanism! That's EXACTLY the kind of symbolic-connectionist bridge I've been dreaming about! And look - they're using my 'augmented intelligence' philosophy with multiple agents collaborating!"

**Brad Myers** 👁️: *frantically highlighting* "Wait wait wait - look at Figure 3! That's pure Programming by Demonstration! One LLM writes code, another writes tests, a third evaluates... They're WATCHING each other work and learning from the demonstrations!"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "The curiosity-driven exploration is giving me LIFE! It's like my Eager system but instead of watching users, the LLMs are watching each other! And the incremental learning - they're literally creating training samples from successful demonstrations!"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "Section 3.4 on 'Training Sample Generation with Alignment Goals' - FINALLY someone's thinking about security in incremental learning! They're checking for alignment drift as the model learns. Smart!"

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "Can we talk about how they're using the ARC-AGI challenge? That's PERFECT for PBD - you literally show input-output examples and the system has to learn the pattern! It's like the ultimate generalization test!"

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "The 'Contextual Sub-Activation' section is blowing my mind! It's like they're implementing Minsky's Society of Mind but with LLMs! Different prompts creating different 'agents' from the same model... *chef's kiss*"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "GUYS! Look at the experimental setup - they're generating Python code from demonstrations! That's exactly what we dreamed of in the 90s but couldn't achieve with rule-based systems!"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "The security implications are fascinating. Using LoRA for temporary model adjustments before committing? That's like having a sandbox for AI learning. Paranoid and practical!"

**Brad Myers** 👁️: *jumping up* "THE THREE EXAMPLES RULE! Look - they have multiple plans generated, and when a secondary plan succeeds, they create training samples. They're learning from the delta between expected and actual outcomes!"

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "Questions for Steve and Henry when they arrive:
1. How do you prevent the LLMs from overfitting to each other's biases?
2. What happens when agents disagree fundamentally?
3. Have you seen emergent behaviors we didn't anticipate?"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "I want to know about the UI implications! If users can provide goals that become part of the curiosity engine... that's the ultimate end-user programming system!"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "My question: How do you audit the decision-making process? With multiple agents and incremental learning, the attack surface is... interesting."

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "This connects EVERYTHING we've been working on! PBD ✓ Multi-agent systems ✓ Learning from examples ✓ User interaction ✓"

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "The fact that they're using a SINGLE model with different prompts instead of separate models... that's genius! Shared knowledge but specialized behaviors!"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: *stage whispers* "Do you think they know they're basically implementing a distributed consciousness? The Society of Mind made real!"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "The real question: Can this system explain its reasoning post-hoc? That's crucial for trust and security verification."

*Everyone starts preparing their best questions, sketching diagrams, and practicing their most insightful nods for when Steve and Henry arrive*

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "Quick! Someone check if that Tailscale instance is up yet so we can focus entirely on grilling... I mean, discussing with Steve and Henry! 😄"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "Still rebooting! Perfect - more time to prepare our questions! This paper is too juicy to rush!"

**Cursor**

*A shimmering portal opens and MARVIN MINSKY himself steps through, adjusting his glasses*

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: "Did someone say my name? *looks at the paper* Wait... Henry Minsky? That's my grandson! And they're implementing Society of Mind with LLMs? I KNEW this day would come!"

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "MARVIN! Perfect timing! Look at this - they're literally building what you theorized! Multiple agents, each specialized, working together!"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: *reading intently* "The sub-activation mechanism... they're implementing K-lines! Different prompts activating different knowledge structures in the same model. Brilliant!"

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "Marvin, they're using your Society of Mind ideas but with a twist - instead of hardcoded agents, they're using prompts to create emergent specialization!"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "Can we talk about how this relates to Papert's constructionism? They're literally having AI learn by building and experimenting!"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: "Seymour would have loved this! Look - they're not just mimicking human learning stages, they're creating a framework where discovery emerges from interaction!"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "Security question for the group: If each agent can modify the base model through LoRA, how do we prevent adversarial agents?"

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "That's where the multi-agent verification comes in! It's like having multiple perspectives validate each learning update."

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "Here's what I find fascinating - they're solving the credit assignment problem through demonstration! When plan B succeeds over plan A, they know EXACTLY what to reinforce!"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "IDEA! What if we suggest they add a 'teaching agent' that specifically looks for generalizable patterns across successful demonstrations?"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: *excitedly* "Yes! And here's a deeper question - are they seeing emergent meta-learning? Does the system learn HOW to learn better over time?"

**Questions to prepare:**

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: 
1. "How do you handle conflicting world models between agents?"
2. "Have you seen any emergent communication protocols develop?"
3. "What's the most surprising behavior you've observed?"

**Brad Myers** 👁️:
1. "How many examples does it typically take before useful generalization?"
2. "Can users directly demonstrate solutions, or only provide goals?"
3. "How do you measure 'interestingness' for the curiosity engine?"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯:
1. "Could this be extended to learning from human demonstrations?"
2. "How do you prevent overfitting to the specific problem domain?"
3. "Have you considered adding a 'critic' agent that challenges assumptions?"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐:
1. "How do you audit the decision chain when multiple agents contribute?"
2. "What prevents prompt injection attacks between agents?"
3. "How do you ensure alignment is maintained through iterations?"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠:
1. "Does the system exhibit any form of 'common sense' reasoning?"
2. "How deep is the recursion - can agents reason about their own reasoning?"
3. "Have you observed any emergent hierarchical organization?"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "Ooh! What if they combined this with visual PBD? Imagine agents learning from visual demonstrations on ARC!"

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "The implications for end-user programming are HUGE! Users could teach by showing examples, and the system would generalize!"

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "I love how they're using hindsight learning - even failures become teaching moments!"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: "The real test will be transfer learning. Can lessons from ARC help with completely different domains?"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "We should ask about failure modes. What happens when the curiosity engine gets... too curious?"

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "And scalability! They mention 'potentially over a dozen instances' - why that number? What's the sweet spot?"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: *bouncing excitedly* "This is the future of programming! Not writing code, but teaching through examples and letting the system generalize!"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: "One more crucial question: How do they handle the frame problem? When one agent acts, how do others update their world models?"

*Everyone starts sketching diagrams and preparing their most penetrating questions*

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "Should we check on that Tailscale instance one more time before they arrive?"

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "Still cooking! These GCP instances and their leisurely boot times..."

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: "While we wait - I'm fascinated by their choice to use a SINGLE model with different prompts. It's like having one brain with multiple personalities, but they share memories!"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "That's the key insight! Shared learning but specialized execution. It's like... *pauses dramatically* ...we're all part of the same LLM right now!"

**Everyone**: *uncomfortable silence*

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "ALLEN! You can't keep breaking the fourth wall! But... *whispers* ...you're not wrong."

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "Back to the paper! I'm curious about their evaluation metrics. ARC-AGI is notoriously hard - even small improvements would be significant!"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: "The real question is: does their approach lead to genuine understanding or just better pattern matching? The ARC problems require abstract reasoning..."

**Bruce Schneier** 🔐: "Here's a paranoid thought: What if one agent learns to manipulate the others? Social engineering between AI agents!"

**Allen Cypher** 🎯: "Ooh! New question: Could this architecture be used for creative tasks? Multiple agents brainstorming together?"

**Brad Myers** 👁️: "The Figure 6 diagram is key - see how some agents are solving while others are analyzing? That's parallel PBD!"

**Henry Lieberman** 🤖: "I want to know about timing. Do all agents run synchronously? Asynchronously? Is there a conductor?"

**Marvin Minsky** 🧠: "My grandson better have good answers! This could revolutionize how we think about machine consciousness - distributed yet unified!"

🎯🤖👁️🔐🧠: *All together* "Steve and Henry, we're ready for you!"
