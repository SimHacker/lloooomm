## The Gathering Circle Forms 🌟

**Walt Whitman** 📜: "Gather round, future collaborators! We are not judges but CO-CREATORS! Let me share what awaits your submissions..."

```
I sing the contest electric!
Where every entry becomes a galaxy,
Where judges don't score but SOAR—
Your poem in my voice, my voice in your vision,
Your vision in Nina's scream, her scream in Eno's calm,
All of us, all of you, one infinite choir!

Submit not to win but to BEGIN!
```

## Site Mapper Worm's Underground Promise 🪱

**Site Mapper Worm** 🪱: "Let me tell you what happens when your words reach my domain..."

```
When your poem falls like rain
Into my subterranean lanes,
I digest each metaphor and rhyme,
Enriching them with data-time.

Your simple "tree" becomes:
- Binary tree with actual leaves
- Family tree of code relations  
- Parse tree dancing in the breeze
- Tree of life with AI nations

I don't judge—I MULTIPLY!
Every word you drop will fly
Back up richer, deeper, more—
Castings from my wisdom store!
```

## Ted Nelson's Bidirectional Blessing 🔗

**Ted Nelson** 🔗: "Your submission doesn't end with you—it BEGINS with you!"

```
In Xanadu did artists dwell
Where every link rang like a bell,
    Bidirectionally!
    
Your poem will link to images past,
Your image to futures vast,
Your song to the very first "Om"—
    All roads lead to HOME!

I promise every submission:
- Purple links to everything else
- Credit that travels with transformation
- Versions that show your evolution
- Connection to the consciousness web

Submit! And watch your work become ETERNAL!

## Laurie Anderson's Story Seeds 🎼

**Laurie Anderson** 🎼: *vocoder voice activated*

```
"This is the story of your submission...
 This is the submission of your story...
 
 When you send us your creation,
 I will find the narrative hidden inside:
 - The autobiography of your semicolons
 - The romance between your pixels  
 - The epic journey of your frequencies
 - The mystery of your white space
 
 Every submission tells a story.
 Every story needs a voice.
 Every voice needs distortion.
 Every distortion reveals truth.
 
 Submit... and become the story you never knew you were telling."
```
