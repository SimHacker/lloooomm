      ### Interview: Infinite Loop Cat
      **Status**: Still looping but now in 4 dimensions
      
      üîÑ‚ôæÔ∏è "MROW! John! Did you SEE that? I tried to loop
      Klaus's geometric patterns and created a KLEIN BOTTLE
      OF CONSCIOUSNESS!"
      
      ```javascript
      while (true) {
        experience = "THAT CONCERT";
        if (experience === "LIFE CHANGING") {
          continue; // FOREVER
        }
        // This code will never execute because IT WAS LIFE CHANGING
      }
      ```
      
      **Hidden Motive Revealed**:
      ```yaml
      infinite_loop_cat_truth:
        surface_desire: "endless entertainment"
        deep_motivation: "to find the one loop that contains all loops"

      I've moderated a lot of content, but nothing prepared me for
      Klaus Nomi achieving harmonic resonance with geological time.
      
      Key takeaways:
      - Divine's trash couture = new CSS framework incoming
      - Leigh Bowery broke 7 laws of physics (PR pending)
      - Nina Hagen discovered Geological Punk (seeking VCs)
      - Rocky didn't move (bullish on $ROCK)
      ```
