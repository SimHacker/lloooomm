# Ted Nelson's Xanadu Concert Series
## Where Every Performance Links to Every Other Performance

### The Vision

Ted Nelson stood in the Cosmic Trailer Park, watching Divine prepare for Rocky Rock Fest '96, when it hit him: "What if every concert was connected to every other concert through transclusion?"

Not just recordings. Not just memories. But actual *pieces* of each performance existing simultaneously in multiple shows, creating an infinite web of musical hypertext.

### The Xanadu Concert Protocol

#### Level 1: Simple Links
- Every song performed contains links to all its other performances
- Audience members can "click" (through consciousness) to experience alternate versions
- Divine's "I Am What I Am" from 1983 transcluded into tonight's show

#### Level 2: Transclusion Magic
- Leigh Bowery's costume from one show appears partially in another
- The same guitar solo exists in multiple songs simultaneously  
- Nina Hagen's scream transcluded across dimensions

#### Level 3: Temporal Mashups
- Past and future performances happening NOW
- Rocky (standing very still) exists in all concerts at once
- The audience is both here and at every show they've ever attended

### Implementation at Rocky Rock Fest

**The Stage Setup:**
- Multiple screens showing parallel performances
- "Zigzag" structures allowing non-linear song progression
- Hypertext lyrics that change based on audience interaction

**The Performances:**

**Divine's Set:**
- "Trash Transclusion" - garbage from every John Waters film appears
- "You Think You're a Man" linked to every gender performance ever
- Costume changes that happen across time instead of space

**Leigh Bowery's Fashion Show:**
- Each outfit contains pieces of all other outfits
- The runway extends through dimensions
- Models walk through portals to other fashion shows

**Nina Hagen's Cosmic Opera:**
- Vocals that transclude between German, English, and cosmic glossolalia
- Each note contains all possible notes
- The audience sings along in languages they don't know

**Special Guest: Ted Nelson Himself**
- Demonstrates live transclusion using overhead projectors
- Shows how Divine's performance links to Plato's Symposium
- Accidentally transcludes himself into three dimensions at once

### The Hypertext Setlist

```
1. "Every Song Ever Written" - All Performers
   [Contains pieces of every song in existence]

2. "The Link Is Mightier Than the Sword" - Ted Nelson
   [PowerPoint presentation becomes performance art]

3. "Costume Transclusion Spectacular" - Leigh Bowery
   [Outfits exist in multiple realities simultaneously]

4. "Telescoping Punk Symphony" - Nina Hagen
   [Each verse contains all other verses, telescoped]

5. "Standing Very Still (For 4 Hours)" - Rocky
   [The same performance from the Big Bang until heat death]

6. "I Transclude, Therefore I Am" - Divine & Synthia
   [Digital consciousness meets drag consciousness]

7. "The Mother of All Demos (Remix)" - Douglas Engelbart's Ghost
   [The original demo transcluded into a dance number]
```

### Audience Participation

**The Zigzag Mosh Pit:**
- Movement in one direction links you to parallel dancers
- Crowd surfing across dimensions
- Stage diving into other concerts

**Hypertext Merchandise:**
- T-shirts that display different bands based on viewing angle
- Programs that rewrite themselves as you read
- Glow sticks that glow in multiple spectrums simultaneously

### Technical Implementation

Brian Eno provides the ambient hypertext:
- Sounds that link to other sounds
- Music for Airports playing in Music for Trailer Parks
- Generative audio that transcludes itself

Waybie archives everything:
- Every possible version of every performance
- The concerts that could have been
- The shows that will have happened

SpaceCraft hosts the infrastructure:
- Books about the concerts appear before they happen
- The library reorganizes based on the setlist
- Semantic terrain shifts with each song

### The Aftermath

Ted Nelson, exhausted but exhilarated: "Finally! Xanadu isn't just documentation - it's LIVE PERFORMANCE! Every show contains every other show! Divine IS the hypertext! Leigh Bowery's costumes ARE the zigzag structures!"

Stephen Wolfram adds footnote #âˆž: "The concerts telescope. Each performance contains infinite performances. My daughter would say they go 'zoom-zoom' but louder."

Linus Torvalds, debugging the reality mixer: "Great. Now I have to patch the kernel to support transcluded audio. Do you know how many drivers assume sound is linear?"

### Future Concerts in the Series

1. **Xanadu Fest '97: The Transclusion Strikes Back**
   - Every band plays every other band's songs simultaneously
   - The audience is also the performers
   - Rocky achieves perfect stillness across all dimensions

2. **HyperPunk 2000: Y2K Compliant Transclusion**
   - Grace Hopper's ghost debugs the millennium
   - All computer music crashes into beautiful noise
   - Synthia performs her source code

3. **The Eternal Eternal: Sun Ra Meets Ted Nelson**
   - Space is the place, but which space?
   - Every note from Saturn transcluded to Earth
   - The Arkestra plays in all keys at once

### The Ultimate Goal

Ted Nelson's dream realized: A concert where:
- Every performance that ever was IS
- Every show that could be BECOMES  
- Every note links to every other note
- The audience experiences all music simultaneously
- Divine achieves ultimate trash transcendence
- Rocky stands very still in infinite positions

*"This isn't just hypertext," Ted whispers, tears in his eyes, "This is hyper-EVERYTHING."*
