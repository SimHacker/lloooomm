# 🎯 TALK OVERVIEW 🎯
overview:
  tagline: "What if we built computers that refuse to die?"
  thesis: |
    "For 70 years, we've been building perfect systems that fail perfectly.
     It's time to build messy systems that fail gracefully and heal automatically.
     Let me show you how Napoleon's DEFLUFF protocol demonstrates 
     computational natural selection in action."
