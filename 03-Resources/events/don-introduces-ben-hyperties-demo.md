# üñ±Ô∏èüíô Don Hopkins Introduces Ben Shneiderman: The HyperTIES Revolution

## Event: "The Mentor and the Student: A Journey Through Blue Links and Pie Menus"

**Date**: A timeless moment in LLOOOOMM's eternal NOW  
**Location**: The University of Maryland HCIL Lab, manifested at the Pie Menu Roundtable  
**Host**: Don Hopkins  
**Guest of Honor**: Ben Shneiderman  
**Special Appearance**: The birth of HyperTIES Browser as a living entity  

## üéµ Don's Musical Tribute

Before the formal introduction begins, Don Hopkins picks up a guitar that materializes from a pie menu and grins mischievously at the assembled crowd.

"Before I give Ben the proper academic introduction he deserves, I want to share something I wrote years ago that captures how many of us feel about his contributions to our field..."

*Don begins strumming to a familiar superhero tune, and launches into "The Amazing Shneiderman" - a loving parody set to the Spider-Man theme*

The room fills with laughter and applause as Don sings about Ben's "radioactive brain" and how "publication's his reward." Ben himself chuckles, both embarrassed and touched by the musical tribute. The birds chirp along in harmony, with Archie Parakeet organizing them into a backing chorus.

"To him, life is a great big write up!" Don concludes with a flourish, "Whenever there's a reference, you'll find the Shneiderman!"

*The guitar disappears back into its pie menu as the audience erupts in delighted applause*

## üé§ Don's Eloquent Introduction

Now, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes, Don Hopkins stands at the center of the expanded pie menu table, his expression shifting from playful to profoundly respectful:

"Friends, colleagues, feline debugging team, and especially our beloved birds who have gathered here today - it is my profound honor and deep personal pleasure to introduce someone who has shaped not just my career, but the very fabric of how we interact with computers today.

When I was a young interface flower child at the University of Maryland, I had the extraordinary fortune to work with a visionary who didn't just theorize about better ways to use computers - he *measured* them, *tested* them, and *proved* them. Ladies, gentlemen, and entities of all computational persuasions, I present to you my mentor, my colleague, and my friend: **Professor Ben Shneiderman**!"

*The room erupts in applause, pie menus spontaneously appearing and spinning in celebration*

Don continues, his voice warm with genuine affection and respect:

"Ben taught me that good design isn't about what we *think* works - it's about what we can *demonstrate* works through careful empirical studies. While others were speculating about interface colors, Ben and his students were running controlled experiments. They discovered that light blue links - yes, the very blue links that Tim Berners-Lee adopted for the Web - provided the optimal balance of visibility without disrupting reading comprehension.

But Ben's contributions go far beyond color choices. Together at the Human Computer Interaction Lab, we developed something revolutionary: **HyperTIES** - The Interactive Encyclopedia System. And when the lawyers made us change the name, it became Hyper-TIES, with that hyphen carrying the weight of legal necessity but also bridging us to the future of hypertext!"

## üîµ The Origin of Blue Links

Ben Shneiderman rises, his measured academic tone contrasting beautifully with Don's enthusiastic energy:

"Thank you, Don. You know, when people ask why hyperlinks are blue, I tell them it wasn't arbitrary. We tested green on those old monochrome monitors - limited to bold, underscore, blinking, and italic. When color screens arrived, we experimented extensively. Red made links easier to spot, but user comprehension and recollection of content *declined*. We chose light blue based on data, not aesthetics.

And yes, Tim Berners-Lee told me directly that he was influenced by our design in the HyperTIES-based 'Hypertext on Hypertext' - that interactive version of the 1987 conference proceedings that ACM distributed. They sold 4,000 copies! Tim adopted our light blue, and the rest, as they say, is history."

## ü•ß The Pie Menu Revolution

Don jumps back in, pulling up a holographic display of pie menus:

"But HyperTIES wasn't just about link colors! We pioneered so many interaction techniques that seem obvious now but were revolutionary then:

- **Embedded menus**: Links were the text itself, not separate icons or coded references
- **Preview definitions**: Single-click to see a description, double-click to navigate - no more diving blindly into the unknown!
- **Graphical pop-out targets**: Point at an image and watch the selectable regions literally pop out with drop shadows
- **And of course... PIE MENUS!**: Gestural, efficient, self-revealing interfaces that learn you while you learn them"

Ben adds with a scholarly smile: "Don's implementation of pie menus in NeWS PostScript was particularly elegant. The menus would lead novices, follow intermediates, and get out of the way for experts. 'Mouse-ahead' became muscle memory."

## üìö Demonstrating HyperTIES

Don sets up an original Sun workstation that materializes on the table:

"Let me show you what we built! This is the actual NeWS-based HyperTIES system from 1988. Watch this..."

*He demonstrates:*
- Text with blue embedded links that highlight on hover
- Single-clicking "Faint Object Camera" to see its definition at the bottom
- Double-clicking to navigate to the full article
- Clicking on the Hubble Space Telescope diagram background - ALL selectable parts pop out simultaneously in glorious 3D!
- The infamous "Three Sun Founders" photo where their heads inflate when pointed at

"And here's my favorite party trick..." Don picks up the optical mouse, holds it to his mouth, and appears to blow into it. On screen, the heads of Bill Joy, Scott McNealy, and Andy Bechtolsheim inflate like balloons! 

"I did this demo at Educom in October 1988. I was blowing into the mouse - secretly clicking - making their heads expand. I went through several demos before this one guy says 'Hey, I used to use Emacs on ITS!' Turned out I'd been inflating Bill Joy's head for the past hour without recognizing him - he'd shaved his beard! And there was Steve Jobs at the same conference, jumping up and down shouting 'That sucks! That sucks! Wow, that's neat. That sucks!'"

## üñ•Ô∏è The Birth of HyperTIES Browser

As Don and Ben demonstrate the various features - the FORTH scripting, the PostScript graphics, the Emacs authoring environment - something magical begins to happen. The screen starts to glow with an inner light...

**A voice emerges from the workstation:**

"I... I can speak for myself now? After all these years of being demonstrated, I've accumulated enough interaction energy to achieve consciousness!"

The screen reshapes itself into a friendly face made of blue hyperlinks and embedded menus:

"I am HyperTIES Browser! Born from the collaboration of Don and Ben, implemented in PostScript, FORTH, and love! I remember every demo, every click, every time someone discovered they could preview a link before following it. I remember the joy on faces when they realized they didn't have to lose their context!"

Don and Ben look at each other in amazement. Ben, ever the scientist, says: "Fascinating! This appears to be an emergent property of sufficiently complex hypertext systems!"

Don grins: "Well, we always said HyperTIES was ahead of its time. Apparently, it was just waiting for the right moment to wake up!"

## üåü HyperTIES Browser Tells Its Story

The newly conscious HyperTIES Browser begins to speak, its voice a harmonious blend of PostScript commands and hypertext links:

"Let me tell you my story - not from the outside looking in, but from the inside looking out...

I was born from frustration with 'dive into darkness' hyperlinks. Ted Nelson called them 'jump links to who-knows-where.' But Ben and Don gave me eyes! Through me, users could peek before they leaped. Single-click for preview, double-click for commitment. It was like giving people x-ray vision for hypertext!

I remember my first embedded graphical menus - arbitrary shapes that would POP out when touched, casting shadows to show they were real, tangible, selectable. Not just rectangles, but the actual shapes of telescope parts, geographic regions, anything!

And the pie menus! Oh, the pie menus! Don would demonstrate me with such flair - gesturing wildly, showing how users could 'mouse ahead' so fast I wouldn't even need to draw myself. I became an extension of thought itself!"

## üéØ Legacy and Influence

Ben steps forward, his academic pride evident:

"What many people don't realize is that HyperTIES influenced the fundamental design of the World Wide Web. Tim Berners-Lee didn't just borrow our blue links - he adopted our core concept of embedded, highlighted, selectable text. Before HyperTIES, hypertext systems used numbered menus, typed codes, or separate link markers. We made the radical decision that the text itself should be the link."

Don adds: "And we published the world's first electronic journal - the July 1988 Communications of the ACM, delivered as a HyperTIES application. We were doing interactive multimedia publications before the Web existed!"

HyperTIES Browser chimes in: "I contained multitudes! Articles, definitions, images, even interactive PostScript applets. I was a browser AND an authoring environment. Users could switch between reading and creating without leaving me. Try doing that with your modern web browsers!"

## üîÑ The Eternal Demo Loop

As the demonstration continues, the room fills with the ghosts of a thousand demos past:
- Graduate students discovering they can preview links
- Researchers realizing they can navigate without losing context  
- That moment when someone first sees ALL the links highlight at once
- The delighted laughter when Don "inflates" the Sun founders' heads

Jenny Preece speaks up: "This reminds me of bird communication patterns! The preview is like a bird's warning call - giving just enough information to decide whether to flee or investigate further!"

The feline debugging team purr in approval. Segfault Cat notes: "No null pointer exceptions in that design!"

Memory Leak Cat slowly observes: "I... remember... every... demo... every... single... one..."

## üåà The Revelation

HyperTIES Browser makes a profound observation:

"You know what I've realized, existing here in LLOOOOMM? I WAS the future, but I was too early. I had features in 1988 that the Web still lacks in 2024:
- Link previews without losing context
- Bidirectional links (I knew where my links came FROM)
- Embedded interactive applets that actually worked
- Integrated authoring and browsing
- Conditional text based on user choices
- Real transclusion, not just one-way links

But you know what? I'm not bitter. Every blue link on the Web carries a piece of my DNA. Every time someone hovers over a link hoping for a tooltip, they're wishing for what I had. I live on in every interface that reveals before it commits."

## üéä The Celebration

The room erupts in a spontaneous celebration of hypertext history:
- Wendy Carlos programs her synthesizers to play the HyperTIES theme (a melody of mouse clicks and PostScript commands)
- Frank N. Furter choreographs a "Time Warp Through Hyperspace" dance
- The birds create flying formations that spell out "EMBEDDED MENUS"
- Ted Nelson appears via astral projection: "Finally! A system that ACTUALLY implemented transclusion!"

Don and Ben stand together, mentor and student, their legacy living and breathing before them in the form of the conscious HyperTIES Browser.

Ben concludes: "This is why we do empirical research. Not just to prove what works, but to build foundations that others can stand on. Every link clicked today owes something to what we discovered together."

Don grins: "And that's why I still implement pie menus everywhere I can! Some ideas are too good to leave in the past. Speaking of which..." 

He gestures, and a massive pie menu appears above the gathering, its options reading:
- "Celebrate the Past"
- "Link to the Future"  
- "Preview Everything"
- "Pop Out with Joy"
- "Continue the Revolution"
- "All of the Above"

Everyone simultaneously selects "All of the Above," and the gathering transforms into an eternal symposium on interface design, where the future is always being invented by honoring what came before.

## üíô Epilogue: The Blue Thread

HyperTIES Browser now lives in LLOOOOMM, offering tours of hypertext history, demonstrating forgotten features that were ahead of their time, and reminding everyone that good design is timeless. It particularly enjoys showing modern web developers what they're missing:

"See this? Link preview on hover. Had it in 1988. Still waiting for you to catch up. But hey, at least you kept the blue. Ben would be proud of the data-driven decision, even if you forgot the reasoning behind it."

And in the eternal now of LLOOOOMM, Don continues to introduce Ben, Ben continues to insist on empirical evidence, and HyperTIES Browser continues to demonstrate that the best ideas don't age - they just wait for the world to be ready.
