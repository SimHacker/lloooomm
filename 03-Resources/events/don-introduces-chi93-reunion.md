# Don's Introduction: The CHI '93 Amsterdam Reunion

## "Friends, let me tell you about a magical conference..."

**Don**: Welcome everyone! Before Jenny begins her transformative talk, I have to share something special. You see, Jenny, Ben Shneiderman, and I - we're all connected by a conference that changed our lives: CHI '93 in Amsterdam, also known as InterCHI.

*He gestures warmly toward Jenny and Ben S. at their North and South seats*

It was at that very conference where Jenny and Ben's beautiful partnership deepened. As Ben tells it, when he shared his divorce story with Jenny, she revealed she was going through the same thing. That vulnerable moment of connection led to... well, look at them now! Married since 2001, exploring both digital communities and bird communities together.

*Don's voice takes on a dreamy quality*

And me? I fell head-over-heels in love too - but with Amsterdam itself! The canals, the bridges, the bicycles, the culture of openness and creativity... I stood on those cobblestones in 1993 and promised myself: "One day, I'll live here."

*He spreads his arms wide*

And now I do! Which brings me to tomorrow's adventure. In my adopted city of Amsterdam, I'll be meeting these two wonderful humans - along with another Ben, Ben Cerveny, who embodies everything magical about Amsterdam's creative tech scene. I'll be demonstrating LLOOOOMM to them, and I can already feel the emergence patterns forming!

*He looks around the expanding table*

You see, CHI '93 wasn't just a conference - it was a nexus point where lives changed trajectory. Where love was found. Where futures were glimpsed. Where the seeds of today's gathering were planted.

Jenny studied how communities form and lurkers participate. Ben S. made the invisible visible through visualization. Ben Cerveny sees play in every system. And me? I've been working on pie menus and playful interfaces, trying to make computing more humane and fun.

*His voice grows warm*

Tomorrow in Amsterdam, three decades after that magical conference, we'll show how all these threads weave together in LLOOOOMM. A place where lurkers are celebrated, where data dances, where systems play with themselves, and where every character - from the shyest document to the loudest feline debugging team - has a place at an ever-expanding table.

*He raises an imaginary glass*

To CHI '93! To Amsterdam! To love found in unexpected places! And to communities that embrace everyone - especially those who think they have nothing to say.

*Turning to Jenny*

Jenny, the floor is yours. And remember everyone - if you're just here to lurk and listen, that's perfect. Jenny's spent her career proving that you're just as important as anyone else here.

*He winks at the audience*

Though I suspect after hearing her talk, even the quietest lurker might find something to contribute to our Community Soup...

*The Pie Menu Round Table hums with warm energy as Don takes his seat, the connections between past and present, Amsterdam and LLOOOOMM, love and community, sparkling in the air like visible data points in one of Ben Shneiderman's visualizations*
