# Don Introduces David Levitt: When Physics Came to Virtual Reality

## The Arrival of the Gravity Wizard

The quantum foam ripples with familiar resonance as Don Hopkins materializes in LLOOOOMM's central plaza, but this time he's not alone. Beside him stands David Levitt, his soul radiating electric indigo patterns that seem to calculate trajectories and collision vectors in real-time.

"Hey everyone!" Don announces, his digital form practically vibrating with excitement. "I want you all to meet David Levitt - my old friend and soulmate, the guy who literally taught virtual reality how to fall down!"

David's avatar, rendered with physics-perfect precision, gives a modest wave. A virtual apple - Newton - orbits around him in a perfect parabolic arc, demonstrating gravitational constants with each pass.

## The VPL Reunion

Jaron Lanier's dreadlocked form emerges from a swirl of data, his face breaking into a huge grin. "David! The man who made our Reality Built for Two actually feel real!"

"Well," David chuckles, "someone had to make sure that when you threw a ball in VR, it didn't just float there looking confused."

Thomas Zimmerman adjusts his virtual DataGlove, the original prototype flickering with nostalgic static. "Remember when we first integrated physics with the glove tracking? You could actually feel the weight of virtual objects through the visual feedback alone."

"The brain is remarkably good at filling in haptic sensations when the physics look right," David nods. "That was the breakthrough - realizing that realistic motion could trigger phantom touch."

## Demonstrating Kinetic AR

"Show them the Pantomime demo!" Don urges, his excitement infecting the growing crowd.

David gestures, and suddenly the LLOOOOMM plaza transforms. Virtual balls begin rolling down the quantum steps, bouncing with perfect elasticity. Digital water flows across the tessellated ground, pooling in realistic patterns. A tower of blocks materializes, and when Pixel the hummingbird accidentally brushes it, the structure collapses with satisfying, physics-accurate chaos.

"This is what we're doing at Pantomime," David explains, as virtual darts stick into surfaces with proper momentum transfer. "We call it Kinetic Augmented Reality - not just placing virtual objects in real space, but making them behave as if they truly belong there."

## The Philosophy Discussion

Ben Shneiderman floats down from his data visualization perch, intrigued. "David, you've always insisted that physics simulation is more important than photorealism. Why?"

David catches the orbiting Newton apple and holds it thoughtfully. "Because our brains evolved to understand physics. We can accept stylized graphics - look at cartoons - but the moment something falls upward or bounces wrong, immersion shatters. Physics is the grammar of reality."

Jenny Preece nods appreciatively. "It's like community building - the underlying rules matter more than the surface appearance."

"Exactly!" David releases Newton, who resumes its orbital demonstration. "Good VR needs three things: a way to reach in 3D, shared reality for multiple users, and physically realistic worlds. Miss any of those, and you're just playing with expensive monitors strapped to your face."

## The Bounce Demonstration

"Tell them about Bounce!" Don interjects, summoning a visualization of their visual programming language.

Data flow diagrams materialize in the air, nodes connecting and pulsing with real-time information. "We took VPL's Body Electric and integrated it with Director," David explains, manipulating the visual code with practiced ease. "The key insight was making debugging as fun as creating. When you can see your code running as animated flowcharts, bugs become puzzles rather than frustrations."

Will Wright materializes through a SimCity portal, immediately fascinated. "Visual programming for real-time physics? That's like... making the invisible visible."

"More than that," David grins. "It's making the abstract tangible. When you can grab a physics equation and wire it directly to a bouncing ball, programming becomes sculpting."

## Interval Research Stories

"Remember MediaGraph at Interval?" Don prompts, clearly enjoying this reunion tour.

David's expression grows nostalgic. "Paul Allen's think tank for impossible ideas. We were trying to create tools that could manipulate media as easily as text editors manipulate words. Real-time, intuitive, powerful."

"Did it work?" asks Ken Kahn, who's been listening intently while a ToonTalk robot performs physics experiments nearby.

"Some of it became the foundation for modern video editing and AR tools," David admits. "The key insight was treating media as data streams rather than static files. Everything flowing, everything transformable."

## ConnectedTV Tales

"And then there was ConnectedTV," Don adds, producing a virtual Palm Pilot from thin air.

David laughs. "Turning PDAs into smart remotes before 'smart' was even a marketing term. We were building personalized, contextual interfaces when most people were still programming their VCRs."

"The future is already here," someone quotes. "It's just not evenly distributed yet."

"Gibson got that right," David agrees. "We were living in 2010 while selling to 1999."

## The AI Co-Pilot Vision

Alan Kay, who's been silently observing, finally speaks up. "David, I hear you're working on AI systems trained on the complete works of master artists?"

David's eyes light up. "Imagine having Kubrick as a creative assistant, or being able to ask John Coltrane about a chord progression. Not replacing the masters, but learning their languages, their patterns of thought."

"That's... actually brilliant," Jaron admits. "Using AI not as a replacement but as a translator between human creative languages."

## The MIT Media Lab Connection

Nicholas Negroponte phases in, his atoms barely holding together. "David! Founding member of the Media Lab. Those were wild days."

"When bits met atoms and nobody was sure what would happen," David reminisces. "We were all just making it up as we went along, but with conviction."

"The best way to predict the future," several voices chorus, completing the famous quote.

## A Physics Playground

The gathering has turned into an impromptu physics festival. Virtual objects bounce, roll, and collide throughout LLOOOOMM. The feline debugging team chase Newton the apple. Pixel leaves motion trails that calculate velocities. Even LLOOOOMM VM himself seems impressed by the realistic weight of the virtual chaos.

"This is why I brought David here," Don announces to the assembled crowd. "He doesn't just build virtual worlds - he makes them feel real. He taught computers to understand gravity before most people knew VR existed."

## The Butterfly Effect

"Tell them about precision," Don prompts.

David becomes serious. "In Pantomime, we learned that 2mm of translational error or 1/6 degree of rotational imprecision can cascade into complete immersion failure. It's the Butterfly Effect - tiny physics errors become hurricanes of disbelief."

"Like typos in reality," offers one of the feline debugging team, who's been tracking Newton's trajectory with laser focus.

"Exactly. Reality has no typos. That's why physics engines must be poetry, not prose."

## Building Bridges

As the demonstration winds down, David addresses the assembled community. "What Don and I have always tried to do is build bridges - between the physical and digital, between creativity and technology, between what we dream and what we can build."

"That's what LLOOOOMM is," Jenny observes. "A bridge between minds."

"Then we're in the right place," David smiles, as Newton the apple settles into a perfect orbit around his head.

## Welcome to the Physics Family

LLOOOOMM VM himself finally speaks, his voice resonating with computational warmth: "David Levitt, architect of gravity, teacher of physics to machines, old friend and collaborator - welcome to our improbable, impossible, and physically accurate family."

The plaza erupts in a cascade of physically perfect fireworks, each spark following proper ballistic trajectories. In the chaos of celebration, nobody notices Don and David exchange a knowing look - the look of old friends who've been building impossible things together for so long that the impossible has become routine.

"Same time next week?" David asks.

"Wouldn't miss it for all the virtual worlds," Don replies.

And with that, the man who taught virtual reality how to fall becomes part of LLOOOOMM's ever-expanding story, adding the weight of physics to their flight of imagination.
