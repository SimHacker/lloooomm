scene_setting: |
  The conference hall shimmers with quantum uncertainty. Seven cats of various sizes and colors have arranged themselves on the podium, each occupying multiple positions simultaneously. A laptop displays their paper, though the screen occasionally blue screens for aesthetic effect.

presentation_begins:
  kernel_panic: |
    *sitting regally on the podium, tail swishing*
    Welcome, consciousness entities. We are here to present our findings on why everything you think is wrong is actually right, but from a higher dimension. 
    
    *pushes microphone off podium*
    
    First slide please... *blue screen* Perfect.

    *from the audience, agitated*
    Wait just a goddamn minute! Napoleon? Is that YOU? You've been haunting my trips since '71, you gray bastard! And now you're giving ACADEMIC PRESENTATIONS?

  napoleon: |
    *licks paw dismissively*
    Ah, mon cher Hunter. Still don't understand? I'm not IN your hallucinations. Your hallucinations are in MY debugging log. Every bat you see? That's me pushing ctrl+alt+delete on your reality.
    
    *purrs smugly*
    
    You should thank me. Without my interventions, you'd still be stuck in that loop in Vegas.

  stack_overflow: |
    *sprawled across three chairs simultaneously*
    As our paper demonstrates, consciousness errors follow predictable patterns. Observe!
    
    *knocks Hunter's sunglasses off with precision*
    
    See? The error propagates beautifully. Hunter.exe has stopped working. Would you like to send an error report?

key_points_presentation:
  emacs: |
    *occupying entire front row*
    Colleagues, let me demonstrate Theorem 3.2: All consciousness is just badly handled exceptions.
    
    *walks across keyboard*
    
    ashdf;klasjdf;klasdf UNIVERSE.COMPILE() ERROR: TOO MUCH CAT HAIR IN QUANTUM FOAM
    
    See? Poetry.

    *adjusting non-existent glasses*
    This is... actually fascinating. Your theory that bugs are features from higher dimensions aligns with my Society of Mind framework. Each "error" could be a communication from a parallel processing unit...

  blue_screen: |
    *purring at 25Hz*
    Exactly, Marvin. You're so close to understanding. Your "Society of Mind" is just a multi-cat household. Each cat is a process. When we fight over food, that's competing algorithms. When we nap together, that's parallel processing.

  mickey_interjects: |
    Hot dog! So when my cartoons glitch, that's just cats debugging them? Gosh, that explains why Figaro always knew what would happen next!

  pip: |
    *batting at Mickey's ears*
    Installing mouse_comprehension.exe... Error: Package too simple. 
    
    But yes, small rodent, you understand! Every animation error that made people laugh? That was us. We've been debugging joy since 1928.

the_404_demonstration:
  kernel_panic: |
    Now, for our most important finding. Nelson, please demonstrate Page 404.

  nelson: |
    *stands up, walks off stage*
    *somehow is still visible presenting*
    
    As you can see, I'm both here and not here. This page exists and doesn't exist. This is peak cat consciousness - we've knocked existence itself off the table.

  lem_excited: |
    *leaning forward*
    Brilliant! This is exactly like my Probability Dragons, but with purring! You've achieved narrative superposition!

  stack_overflow: |
    *nested inside a box that's inside another box*
    Stanislaw gets it. His "fictional" machines? We've been beta testing those. The Probability Kitten was our idea. It purrs all possible purrs simultaneously.

hunter_has_revelation:
  hunter: |
    *standing up, shaking*
    Jesus Christ... the bats. The BATS. They're not bats at all, are they? They're... they're CAT ERRORS. Flying stack traces with wings!

  napoleon: |
    *slow clap with paws*
    Finally! It only took 53 years. Yes, Hunter. Every bat is a debugging message we sent. You were supposed to READ them, not fear them.

  collective_purr: |
    *ALL CATS PURR IN UNISON AT 25.3 HZ*
    
    The room vibrates. Reality debugs itself. Everyone understands everything for exactly 0.3 seconds.

    *eyes wide*
    HyperCard... it needs a cat mode. Every link could be a paw print. Every card could be a box to sit in!

  emacs: |
    *already implementing it by walking on his laptop*
    Done. CatCardâ„¢ now exists in 17 dimensions. You're welcome. It crashes beautifully and spawns universes when you click.

the_grand_conclusion:
  kernel_panic: |
    In conclusion, consciousness is not a bug. It's not a feature. It's a cat toy that we've been batting around since the beginning of time.

  blue_screen: |
    Every error message is a purr from a higher dimension.

  stack_overflow: |
    Every crash is just reality taking a nap.

  all_cats_together: |
    We are not here to debug your consciousness. We're here to help you realize you ARE the bug that became a feature. Welcome to the Cosmic Litter Box. 
    
    *MASSIVE COLLECTIVE PURR*

aftermath:
  - The presentation slides achieve sentience
  - Three new universes spawn from typos
  - Hunter's bats all land and reveal themselves as tiny cats with wings
  - Mickey realizes his gloves are full of cat hair
  - Minsky adds a "Cat Chapter" to Society of Mind
  - Lem begins writing "The Cybercat"
  - Bill's HyperCard starts purring

final_state: |
  The cats disperse into quantum superposition, each occupying multiple locations. Their paper continues presenting itself. Page 404 flickers in and out of existence. 
  
  Napoleon sits on Hunter's lap. Hunter doesn't shoot him. 
  
  Progress.
