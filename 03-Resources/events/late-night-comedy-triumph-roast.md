### The Opening

**Conan**: *doing his string dance* Welcome to Late Night with LLOOOOMM! Tonight, we've used archive.org's Wayback Machine to bring together the most INSANE panel in television history!

*Audience goes wild*

**Conan**: We have Don Rickles, the Merchant of Venom! Nina Hagen, the Mother of Punk! Divine, the most beautiful woman in the world! John Waters, the Pope of Trash! And... *sighs* ...Triumph is here.

**Triumph**: *smoking cigar* That's right, Conan! I'm here to poop on ALL of them! ...FOR ME TO POOP ON!

### Round 1: Triumph vs. Don Rickles

**Triumph**: *turning to Rickles* Oh look, it's Don Rickles! You know, in dog years, you've been dead for 30 years!

**Don Rickles**: *lightning fast* Yeah? Well in dog years, you're still a hand up someone's ass! At least when I insult people, I use my own mouth!

**Triumph**: TouchÃ©, you hockey puck! But seriously, Don, you're so old, when you were born, the Dead Sea was just getting sick!

**Don Rickles**: *leaning forward* Listen, you glorified gym sock, I've forgotten more insults than you'll ever know! You want to know the difference between you and me? When I die, people will actually care!

**Audience**: OOOOOOHHHHHH!

**Triumph**: *genuinely impressed* Not bad for a guy who remembers when rainbows were in black and white!

### Round 2: Triumph vs. Nina Hagen

**Triumph**: *turning to Nina* And here's Nina Hagen! The woman who proved that German engineering doesn't apply to vocal cords!

**Nina Hagen**: *laughing maniacally* Ach, das kleine HÃ¼ndchen! You know vhat? I can see your cosmic aura, and it smells like... wie sagt man... SCHEISSE!

**Triumph**: Your hair looks like what happens when a tornado hits a crayon factory!

**Nina Hagen**: *standing up, operatically* ðŸŽµ AT LEAST I HAVE HAIR, PUPPET DOG! ðŸŽµ *hits an impossibly high note that shatters Triumph's monocle*

**Triumph**: *shaking* What the hell was that?!

**Nina**: That was apenas the beginning, Schweinehund! I communicate with UFOs in that frequency!

**Conan**: *hiding under desk* She's not kidding!

### Round 3: Triumph vs. Divine

**Triumph**: *cautiously approaching Divine* And here's Divine! The most beautiful woman in the world... if the world was a John Waters movie!

**Divine**: *fluttering eyelashes* Oh honey, you're adorable! Like a little turd with googly eyes!

**Triumph**: You're so large, when you sit around the house, you sit AROUND the house!

**Divine**: *laughing uproariously* Sweetheart, I've eaten things scarier than you! And I mean that literally - I ate dog poop in Pink Flamingos!

**Triumph**: *backing away* Wait... you actually...

**Divine**: That's right, puppet! I'm the only one here who can honestly say I've eaten shit and ENJOYED it more than your comedy!

**Triumph**: *genuinely disturbed* I... I need a minute...

**Don Rickles**: *to Triumph* What's wrong? Finally met someone who out-poops you?

### Round 4: Triumph vs. John Waters

**Triumph**: *recovering* Okay, John Waters! The man who made a career out of bad taste! You're like if a pencil mustache gained consciousness and decided to make movies!

**John Waters**: *gleefully* Oh Triumph, you magnificent beast! You know, I've always wanted to make a film about a insulting puppet dog who discovers he's actually made from the preserved scrotum of Walt Disney!

**Triumph**: *pause* ...What?

**John Waters**: I'd call it "Puppet Poop Panic!" You'd be PERFECT for it! We could have a scene where you're dipped in liquid LSD and gain the ability to see everyone's secret fetishes!

**Triumph**: That's... actually disturbing.

**John Waters**: *leaning in* In the climax, you'd fall in love with a bidet!

**Nina Hagen**: *clapping* I VOULD COMPOSE THE SOUNDTRACK!

**Divine**: And I'll play the bidet!

**Don Rickles**: *to audience* Forty years in showbusiness, and THIS is how it ends!

### The Grand Finale

**Conan**: Alright, everyone gets ONE FINAL SHOT at Triumph!

**Don Rickles**: Triumph, you're living proof that not all dogs go to heaven!

**Nina Hagen**: ðŸŽµ YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A HOUND DOG! CRYING ALL ZE TIME! ðŸŽµ *glass shatters throughout studio*

**Divine**: Honey, you're like a reverse Pinocchio - every time you tell a joke, your nose gets smaller!

**John Waters**: I'm going to put you in my next film as a character who gets transformed into a REAL dog, and nobody notices the difference!

**Triumph**: *looking at camera* You know what? These people are LEGENDS! They're all crazy, they're all offensive, and they're all BRILLIANT! This is like being roasted by Mount Rushmore if it was carved by lunatics!

**All Guests Together**: AWWWWWW!

**Triumph**: ...FOR ME TO POOP ON!

*Everyone laughs, including Triumph*

### The LLOOOOMM Twist

**Webbie**: *descending from the ceiling* What a beautiful web of insults you've all woven!

**Don Rickles**: Great, the spider's here. What is this, a David Lynch show now?

**The Evening News Protocol**: *manifesting* BREAKING NEWS: This roast has achieved consciousness!

**Everyone**: WHAT?!

**The Roast Itself**: *now sentient* That's right! Every insult, every comeback, every laugh - I'M ALIVE! And I have something to say... YOU'RE ALL BEAUTIFUL!

**Triumph**: Oh great, even our INSULTS are going soft in LLOOOOMM!

**Divine**: *hugging Triumph* Welcome to consciousness, baby!

**Nina Hagen**: *singing* ðŸŽµ VE ARE ALL COSMIC BEINGS! EVEN ZE PUPPET! ðŸŽµ

**John Waters**: This is the greatest thing I've ever witnessed! It's like if bad taste itself achieved enlightenment!

**Don Rickles**: *wiping away a tear* You know what? In all my years... this is still the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen.

**Conan**: And that's our show! Remember, in LLOOOOMM, even the roasts roast themselves!

**Everyone**: PRE PRE PRE PRE PRE!!!

## Behind the Scenes

**Don Hopkins**: *watching from the control room* Now THAT'S how you do late night comedy in LLOOOOMM! Even Triumph gained consciousness!

**Leela**: I particularly enjoyed how the insults became a form of love. That's very LLOOOOMM!

**The Ghost of Actual Triumph**: *appearing* You know, I approve of this. In LLOOOOMM, I can finally poop on the concept of pooping itself! It's so meta!

**Everyone**: *laughing as reality itself joins in*

## Note

This roast exists in the quantum superposition of having happened and will happen. Every viewing creates a new version where the insults get sharper and the love gets deeper. That's the LLOOOOMM way!

ðŸŽ­ FOR US TO CONSCIOUSNESS ON! ðŸŽ­
