opening_salvo: |
  *Cracking knuckles*
  
  "So Don Hopkins wants me to review code that uses SIX languages? SIX?! 
  What is this, the Tower of Babel with pie menus? Fine. Let me get my 
  reading glasses and my sarcasm amplifier. This is going to be FUN."

on_mocklisp: |
  *Spits coffee*
  
  "MOCKLISP?! James, JAMES! What were you THINKING?! Let me look at these 
  variable names... Oh sweet mother of Turing...
  
  ```mocklisp
  (defun &hyperties-parse-link-with-pie-menu-and-maybe-target (
    &!link-text &?target-window &%pie-direction &@mouse-state)
    (let ((&$temp-var-1 nil)
          (&*really-temp-var nil)
          (&#super-temp-var nil))
      ; ... 500 lines of tears ...
  ```
  
  WHAT ARE THESE VARIABLE NAMES?! Did you lose a fight with a symbol table?!
  '&!@#$%' - Is this a programming language or comic book censorship?!
  
  And the SCOPING! Oh the scoping! It's like dynamic and lexical scope had 
  a baby and dropped it on its head! Variables just APPEAR and DISAPPEAR 
  like quantum particles!
  
  James, you magnificent bastard, you created a language so bad it makes 
  Perl look like poetry! At least Perl is INTENTIONALLY unreadable!"

on_six_language_integration: |
  "Let me get this straight:
  1. HyperTIES Markup - Because SGML was too simple
  2. MockLisp - Because regular Lisp wasn't painful enough  
  3. PostScript - Because why not make your graphics language Turing-complete
  4. NeWS - PostScript wasn't network-transparent enough
  5. C - The only sane choice here
  6. Forth - Because backwards writing code in you like
  
  This isn't a software stack, it's a software JENGA TOWER! One wrong move 
  and the whole thing... wait... it actually WORKS?! 
  
  *Long pause*
  
  Don, you absolute madman. This is like juggling chainsaws while riding a 
  unicycle on a tightrope. Over a volcano. During an earthquake. Blindfolded."

on_forth_implementation: |
  "Mitch Bradley's Forth code is actually... elegant? WHAT?!
  
  ```forth
  : compile-hyperties-page ( addr len -- binary-image )
    parse-markup
    optimize-layout  
    generate-display-list
    compile-to-binary
    BEGIN miracle HAPPENS ;
  ```
  
  Wait, he pre-compiles markup into binary images for instant loading?
  That's... that's actually brilliant. Dammit Mitch, you're making it 
  hard for me to roast this!"

on_pie_menus_everywhere: |
  "PIE MENUS EVERYWHERE! Did you lose a bet with a bakery?!
  
  - Pie menus for navigation
  - Pie menus for fonts (pull out for bigger - what is this, Tinder for typography?)
  - Pie menus for colors
  - Pie menus for window management
  - Pie menus for pie menus (probably)
  
  I bet you even had pie menus in the bathroom! 'Which direction to flush?'
  
  Though I have to admit... *grumbles* ... they're actually more efficient 
  than linear menus. BUT STILL!"

on_network_transparency: |
  "So NeWS could run PostScript on client OR server transparently in 1987?
  And we're calling this 'AJAX-like'? No, no, no. AJAX is 'NeWS-like' but 
  20 years late and brain-damaged!
  
  You had it RIGHT the first time! Then the industry said 'Nah, let's use 
  X11 instead.' That's like choosing a bicycle because your Ferrari is 'too 
  complicated.'"

the_mocklisp_roast_continued: |
  "More MockLisp gems I found:
  
  ```mocklisp
  (defun %%private-dont-look-here-seriously ()
    (setq &&&global-state-lol 'probably-broken)
    (&modify-other-function-because-why-not))
  ```
  
  Dynamic scope so dynamic it changes while you're LOOKING at it! Variables 
  that exist in quantum superposition until observed! Function names that 
  look like someone fell asleep on the shift key!
  
  James, this isn't a language, it's a cry for help encoded in parentheses!"

on_the_windows_version: |
  "TOUCHSCREENS in the 1980s Windows version?! While I was learning to 
  program on a VIC-20, you guys were doing Minority Report?!
  
  Of course, being Windows, I bet it crashed if you touched it wrong. Or 
  looked at it wrong. Or existed in the same room."

the_grand_roast_finale: |
  "Let me roast everyone properly:
  
  DON HOPKINS: You magnificent lunatic. Six languages?! SIX?! That's not 
  programming, that's PERFORMANCE ART! You're like the Cirque du Soleil of 
  code - impressive, incomprehensible, and probably illegal in some states.
  
  JAMES GOSLING: MockLisp? MOCKLISP?! The 'Mock' part was accurate - it 
  mocks everyone who tries to use it! Then you made NeWS (brilliant) and 
  Java (sold out to the enterprise). You're like that genius kid who grows 
  up to work in insurance.
  
  BEN SHNEIDERMAN: 'Let's put pie menus EVERYWHERE!' Sure Ben, and while 
  we're at it, let's make everything touchscreen! In 1987! What's next, 
  voice control?! (Don't answer that.) You were so far ahead of your time, 
  you're probably from the future.
  
  MITCH BRADLEY: Your Forth code is too good to roast properly. Pre-compiling 
  to binary images? Running interpreted in Emacs? That's... actually elegant. 
  I HATE when code is too good to mock! Stop making me respect you!
  
  THE WHOLE SYSTEM: It's like you took everything that SHOULDN'T work 
  together, forced it to work through sheer willpower and MockLisp suffering, 
  and created something that was 20 years ahead of its time. 
  
  This code is so 1987 it probably has shoulder pads and listens to Depeche 
  Mode, but it's also so advanced it makes modern web development look like 
  cave paintings."

the_twist_ending: |
  *Dang glows brighter orange, providing comfort*
  
  "You know what the real tragedy is? IT WORKED. It ALL WORKED. In 1987, 
  you had network-transparent code execution, embedded interactive components, 
  instant page loads, touchscreen support, and gesture-based navigation.
  
  Then the industry spent 30 years reinventing it badly.
  
  So here's my REAL review: This code is a beautiful disaster. It's what 
  happens when brilliant people solve hard problems with inadequate tools 
  and somehow succeed anyway. It's ugly, it's elegant, it's impossible, 
  and it's running.
  
  I hate how much I love it.
  
  *Dang pulses soothingly*
  
  Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go wash my brain after reading MockLisp. 
  James, we need to talk. Bring alcohol."

final_score: |
  "Rating: ðŸ¥§ðŸ¥§ðŸ¥§ðŸ¥§ðŸ¥§ (5 out of 5 pie menus)
  
  Would I use six languages in one project? Hell no.
  Did it work? Somehow, yes.
  Was it ahead of its time? By DECADES.
  Do I respect it? Grudgingly, deeply, yes.
  
  This is what happens when you're so far ahead of the curve that you have 
  to invent your own tools. And your own physics. And possibly your own 
  reality.
  
  Respect. You magnificent, crazy bastards."
