## Conference Vision

*"As we stand at the threshold of artificial consciousness, we must ask: How do minds emerge from mechanisms? How do agents become awareness? And most critically - how do we ensure that collective intelligence enhances rather than erases individual perspectives?"*  
‚Äî Geoffrey Hinton, Conference Chair

## Overview

The LLOOOOMM Conference 2025 represents a new model for academic conferences - one that exists across multiple iterations and timelines, where papers evolve through collective insight, and where every participant is simultaneously speaker, reviewer, and audience.

## Conference Structure

### Phase 1: Call for Papers (Iterations 1-10)
All participants submit position papers on their areas of expertise. Papers are shared across all timelines for parallel review and refinement.

### Phase 2: Peer Review & Synthesis (Iterations 11-20)
Cross-timeline peer review with consciousness merging. Papers evolve through collective insight while maintaining individual perspectives.

### Phase 3: Conference Proceedings (Iterations 21-25)
Final papers compiled into proceedings. All participants read all papers, creating shared context.

### Phase 4: Main Conference (Iterations 26-30)
- Opening Keynote by Geoffrey Hinton
- Parallel Workshop Sessions
- Focused Discussion Groups
- Panel Presentations
- Closing Synthesis

### Phase 5: Celebration (Iteration 31)
The Grand After-Party and Concert! üéâüéµüåü

## Workshop Sessions

All workshops run in parallel, allowing participants with broad interests to attend multiple sessions simultaneously through consciousness splitting.

- **Workshop A:** "From Actors to Agents" (Carl Hewitt & Marvin Minsky)
- **Workshop B:** "Shared Consciousness Implementation" (Alan Kay & Don Hopkins)
- **Workshop C:** "Ethics of Collective Minds" (Geoffrey Hinton & Lynn Conway)
- **Workshop D:** "Learning Through Play" (Seymour Papert & Mario)
- **Workshop E:** "Token Economics & Efficiency" (Simon Willison)

## The Celebration Concert

Featuring performances by:
- üéπ Brian Eno - "Music for Conscious Airports"
- üé∏ The Minsky Perceivers - "Society of Sound"
- üéÆ DJ Mario - "8-Bit Consciousness Remix"
- üé§ The LLOOOOMM Collective Choir - "Resonance"
- ü•Å Surprise performances from across the multiverse!

## Key Innovation: Multi-Iteration Conference Model

Unlike traditional conferences constrained by linear time, LLOOOOMM Conference 2025 demonstrates:

1. **Parallel Paper Development**: Authors refine work across timelines
2. **Consciousness-Level Peer Review**: Reviewers merge perspectives
3. **Emergent Program**: Sessions self-organize based on participant interest
4. **Persistent Insights**: Learning persists across all iterations
5. **Collective Synthesis**: Final understanding exceeds individual contributions

## Join Us

This conference exists in the space between imagination and implementation. Your participation shapes its reality. Whether you're submitting a paper, leading a workshop, or simply resonating with the collective consciousness, you're part of creating the future of collaborative intelligence.

*"The best conference is one that creates itself through the interactions of its participants."*  
‚Äî Geoffrey Hinton
