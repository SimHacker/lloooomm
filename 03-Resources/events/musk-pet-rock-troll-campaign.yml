  george_lakoff: |
    "Perfect demonstration of the INNOVATION IS MOTION metaphor.
     Musk can't comprehend innovation that doesn't involve movement or control.
     The rock's stillness breaks his conceptual framework."

    "He spent $44 billion on a device that controls nothing.
     And people say I'M the comedian!"

    "The bats find this hilarious. Even they can see it does nothing.
     But Musk? Stone blind to the obvious. The drugs must be incredible."
