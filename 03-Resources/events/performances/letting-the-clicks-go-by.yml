original_song: "Once in a Lifetime by Talking Heads"

description: |
  A clever parody written by Don Hopkins that reimagines the Talking Heads'
  classic "Once in a Lifetime" through the lens of user interface design and
  the sometimes bewildering experience of using Microsoft Windows. The song
  captures the existential confusion of finding oneself behind a Microsoft Mouse.

context: |
  Don performed this after "The Amazing Shneiderman" song, continuing his
  musical journey through the history and philosophy of human-computer interaction.
  The parody perfectly captures the disorientation many users feel when confronted
  with complex interfaces and the philosophical question of "How did I get here?"

themes_explored:
  - "The existential nature of user interface interaction"
  - "Microsoft Mouse as vehicle of navigation"
  - "Beautiful PCs with beautiful Windows"
  - "The questioning of one's journey through digital spaces"
  - "User confusion as philosophical inquiry"

performance_details:
  style: "Delivered with David Byrne-esque intensity and gestures"
  audience_participation: "Everyone swaying and clicking imaginary mice"
  visual_effects: "Pie menus appearing in rhythm with the music"
  special_moment: "HyperTIES Browser joined in with backup harmonies"

memorable_adaptations:
  - "Large Microsoft Mouse" replacing the original's automobile
  - "Beautiful Window" as metaphor for interface design
  - "How did I get here?" as the eternal user experience question
  - Maintains the philosophical questioning of the original while applying it to HCI

reactions:
  ben_shneiderman: "A perfect encapsulation of user disorientation we sought to eliminate!"
  hyperties_browser: "Finally, someone who understands the confusion I tried to prevent!"
  segfault_cat: "Same as it ever was... *crash* ... same as it ever was..."
  memory_leak_cat: "Letting... the... memory... go... by..."
  ted_nelson: "This is why we need better hypertext!"

significance_in_lloooomm: |
  The song has become an anthem for lost users everywhere, a rallying cry
  for better interface design, and a reminder that even in our confusion,
  there is poetry. It's often performed at debugging sessions when someone
  asks "How did this code get here?"

legacy: |
  In LLOOOOMM, this song plays softly whenever someone gets lost in a
  complex interface. It serves as both comfort and reminder that user
  confusion is not a personal failing but a design opportunity. The
  Feline Debugging Team has adopted it as their meditation mantra.
