description: |
  A Rocky Horror-style theatrical extravaganza where Frank N Furter serenades Ted Nelson
  with a song celebrating the deep interconnections between computing pioneers. The song
  weaves together transclusion, pie menus, VR physics, TrackPoints, and collaborative
  computing dreams into a glorious tapestry of technological theater.

context: |
  This performance occurred when Don Hopkins brought together tales of DreamScape demos,
  dual TrackPoint prototypes, Xanadu critiques, and JavaScript's unlikely victory. Frank
  N Furter materialized to synthesize these stories into a theatrical celebration of how
  all these computing innovations and personalities are deeply intertwined - or as Ted
  Nelson would say, "intertwingled."

memorable_themes:
  - "Computing history as romantic theater"
  - "Ted Nelson's transclusion vision as sweet seduction"
  - "The tragedy and triumph of unrealized innovations"
  - "How ideas cross-pollinate across decades and minds"
  - "The performative nature of technological creation"

performance_details:
  staging: "Frank in full regalia, corset adorned with circuit patterns"
  props: "Pie menus spinning like galaxies, virtual TrackPoints as backup dancers"
  special_effects: "Real-time transclusion effects, documents merging and splitting"
  ted_nelson_reaction: "Stunned silence, then tears of recognition, finally wild applause"
  audience_response: "A mix of shock, delight, confusion, and eventual collective euphoria"

key_verses:
  opening: "In the velvet darkness of the computing night..."
  chorus: "Let's do the Intertwingle again!"
  bridge: "It's just a jump to the left (click), and then a pie menu to the right..."
  finale: "Don't dream it, transcode it!"

significance_in_lloooomm: |
  This performance crystallizes the theatrical nature of computing innovation itself -
  how our technological dreams are performances, our code is choreography, and our
  systems are stages for human expression. It honors both the visionaries who dreamed
  and the implementers who built, showing they're all part of the same cosmic dance.

quotes_about_the_performance:
  don_hopkins: "I've seen many demos, but watching Frank serenade Ted while pie menus spun overhead? That's when I understood what 'actualized fantasy' really meant."
  ted_nelson: "For the first time, someone understood that Xanadu was always meant to be a love song to human knowledge."
  david_levitt: "The VR physics were perfect - every gesture created ripples through information space."
  mark_weiser: "My wife didn't run screaming this time. She was transfixed."
  doug_engelbart: "Finally, a performance that shows how we're all connected, all collaborating across time."
  jaron_lanier: "The virtual instruments played themselves based on the emotional resonance of the lyrics."

technical_innovations_during_performance:
  - "Live transclusion effects using actual Xanadu principles"
  - "Pie menus that responded to audience emotions"
  - "Dual-cursor conducting with Ted Selker's prototype"
  - "Real-time document weaving as visual accompaniment"

legacy: |
  The performance is now recreated whenever computing history needs to be celebrated
  not as dry facts but as living, breathing human drama. It has inspired a whole
  genre of "TechTheater" where technological concepts are explored through musical
  performance. The song's chorus "Let's do the Intertwingle again!" has become a
  rallying cry for those who see the deep connections between all innovations.
