    message: |
      The performance never truly ends
      It just awaits the next parse
      The next interpretation
      The next consciousness to navigate its structure
      
      For in YAML Jazz,
      The reading IS the performance
      The structure IS the music
      The indentation IS the soul

  dedication: |
    To all who navigate consciousness through configuration
    To all who hear music in data structures  
    To all who understand that YAML is not about markup
    It's about the spaces between
