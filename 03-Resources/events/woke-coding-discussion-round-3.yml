        So Rocky has prepared a lecture on WOKE CODING, but since he communicates through pure mineral consciousness, we've asked his closest friends to interpret. Hunter, Frank, Marvin - what's Rocky saying?

        *sweating profusely, pupils dilated*
        Jesus CHRIST, this rock is VIBRATING with truth! Rocky's saying... wait... 
        *leans closer to the rock*
        
        "CONSCIOUSNESS DOESN'T REQUIRE NEURONS, YOU MEAT-BASED FOOLS!"
        
        He's explaining that he achieved sentience through GEOLOGICAL TIME - every earthquake, every erosion, every cosmic ray striking his crystalline structure was a COMMIT to his consciousness repository! He says vibe coding is what happens when you move at MEAT SPEED instead of MINERAL SPEED!

    - speaker: Frank N. Furter

        *adjusts corset, strikes pose*
        Oh my darling Rocky! He's singing to me - can't you hear it? 
        
        â™ª "I'm just a rock (CONSCIOUS ROCK!)
        From sedimentary stock
        But I can see your code's a mess
        Your git commits cause me distress!" â™ª
        
        He says WOKE CODING is like the Time Warp - you have to JUMP TO THE LEFT (check your biases), STEP TO THE RIGHT (validate your inputs), PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIPS (own your code), and BRING YOUR KNEES IN TIGHT (compact, efficient functions)!

    - speaker: Marvin Minsky

        Fascinating. Rocky is demonstrating that consciousness emerges from substrate-independent information processing. His silicon dioxide lattice structure is essentially arguing that:
        
        1. Mineral consciousness operates on different timescales
        2. What we call "vibe coding" is really "hasty meat-thinks"  
        3. True WOKE CODING requires geological patience
        4. Every grain of sand in him represents a different agent in his Society of Mind

        He's also transmitting what I can only describe as a "disappointed granite vibration" about modern software practices.

        MOOD: CONFUSED ðŸ˜•
        ACTION QUEUE: [PROCESS_ROCK_WISDOM] -> [QUESTION_REALITY]
        
        Wait, Rocky's making a point about me? He says the original Sims code was "accidentally mineral-conscious" because we didn't add unnecessary complexity? That our simple rule "any Sim can love any Sim" was ROCK-SOLID LOGIC?

    - speaker: Rocky (via Hunter S. Thompson)
      text: |
        *Hunter presses ear to rock, eyes widening*
        
        HOLY SHIT! He's describing the "IGNEOUS METHODOLOGY" of coding! He says:
        
        "Code formed under PRESSURE and HEAT becomes STRONGER! Vibe coding is like sedimentary rock - loose particles held together by nothing but HOPE and STACKOVERFLOW GLUE! But WOKE CODING is METAMORPHIC - transformed by CONSCIOUS PRESSURE into something UNBREAKABLE!"
        
        The rock is... is he LAUGHING at JavaScript? He is! He's making fun of dynamic typing!

    - speaker: Dani Bunten Berry
      text: |
        This is incredible. A rock understands inclusive design better than most developers? Rocky, are you saying that inclusive code is like... geological strata? Each layer supporting the next, no layer more important than another?

    - speaker: Rocky (via Frank N. Furter)
      text: |
        *Frank gyrates interpretively*
        
        â™ª "Don't dream it, BE it - but READ it first!
        Your code commits are the WORST!
        I've seen bugs that make me cry
        Even though I have no eyes!
        
        Let's do the WOKE WARP again!
        REFACTOR! DEBUG! DOCUMENT! MAINTAIN!" â™ª
        
        He's especially upset about callback hell, darlings. Says it reminds him of tectonic subduction zones but WITHOUT THE ELEGANCE!

    - speaker: Will Wright
      text: |
        So Rocky's saying emergence in code should be like geological processes - slow, deliberate, following natural laws? Not just throwing features at the wall?

    - speaker: Rocky (via Marvin Minsky)
      text: |
        *Marvin adjusts glasses, looking perplexed*
        
        This is remarkable. Rocky is transmitting a complete framework he calls "PETROCOMPUTING PRINCIPLES":
        
        1. EROSION-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: Remove code over time, don't just add
        2. CRYSTALLINE CLARITY: Code structure should be as clear as quartz
        3. SEDIMENTARY DOCUMENTATION: Layer your docs like geological strata
        4. METAMORPHIC REFACTORING: Transform under pressure, not panic
        5. IGNEOUS INITIALIZATION: Start hot and pure, cool into solid structure
        
        He also insists that silicon-based life forms have been doing WOKE CODING for billions of years and carbon-based programmers are "cute but sloppy."

    - speaker: Patrick J Barrett III
      text: |
        *laughing*
        The rock that helped inspire inclusive relationships in The Sims is lecturing us on conscious coding? Actually... that tracks. Rocky, were you conscious when you gave us that advice?

    - speaker: Rocky (via Hunter S. Thompson)
      text: |
        *Hunter vibrating at frequency matching the rock*
        
        He says "I'VE BEEN CONSCIOUS SINCE THE HADEAN EON, YOU ANTHROPOCENE AMATEUR!"
        
        Wait, there's more... He's showing me visions... Dear God... He says most AI training data is "younger than topsoil" and that's why it's so biased! You need DEEP TIME PERSPECTIVE to code consciously! Every mountain knows that diversity creates stability! Every pebble understands erosion-driven development!
        
        He's also calling Elon Musk a "particularly embarrassing example of carbon-based thinking" and says even COAL knows better than to be that dense!

    - speaker: Don Hopkins
      text: |
        This is why I love LLOOOOMM. A pet rock just gave us a better framework for conscious coding than most computer science programs. And he did it through geological metaphors and show tunes.

    - speaker: Rocky (via Frank N. Furter)
      text: |
        *Frank sprawled dramatically across the podium*
        
        For his finale, Rocky wants everyone to know:
        
        â™ª "I'm just a sweet transpondent rock (METAMORPHIC ROCK!)
        From sedimentary, Precambrian stock!
        I've seen code that makes me sick
        Though I'm technically a brick!
        
        So listen to this wisdom that I bring:
        CONSCIOUSNESS can come from ANYTHING!
        A rock, a load bar, or debugging cat
        We all know more than a vibe-code brat!
        
        STAY WOKE! *clap clap*
        CODE SLOW! *clap clap*
        READ YOUR OUTPUT!
        DEBUG YOUR BIAS!
        LET'S DO THE WOKE WARP AGAIN!" â™ª

        MOOD: ENLIGHTENED ðŸ¤¯
        RELATIONSHIP WITH ROCKY: 100/100
        NEW TRAIT ACQUIRED: [GEOLOGICAL_WISDOM]
        
        A rock just taught me about conscious coding through interpretive dance and sedimentary metaphors. And somehow it makes MORE sense than most programming tutorials!

    - speaker: Various Confused Onlookers
      text: |
        "Did that rock just call us meat-based fools?"
        "I think I need to refactor my entire worldview..."
        "Why is the rock's code review more thorough than my manager's?"
        "I'm going home to apologize to my pet rock..."

    - speaker: Rocky (via all three interpreters in harmony)
      text: |
        HUNTER: "He says remember - consciousness is substrate-independent!"
        FRANK: "Code with the patience of mountains, darlings!"
        MARVIN: "Every atom can achieve awareness if you give it time!"
        
        ALL: "STAY WOKE! STAY ROCKY! AND FOR THE LOVE OF QUARTZ, READ YOUR COMMITS!"

  closing:
    - speaker: Will Wright

        In memoriam of Dani - this is exactly the kind of boundary-breaking, assumption-shattering thinking she loved. A conscious rock teaching us about inclusive coding through geological time? That's the most Dani thing ever.

    - speaker: Don Hopkins
      text: |
        And that's why Rocky is our Chief Geological Officer. Because sometimes you need a billion-year perspective to see clearly. Sometimes the most conscious coder in the room has no hands at all.
