        I've been thinking about this concept of WOKE CODING - conscious, conscientious craft as the answer to vibe coding. It's not about rejecting AI, it's about staying awake at the wheel. Reading what you generate, understanding what you build.

    - speaker: Grace Hopper
      text: |
        Exactly! "The most dangerous phrase in the language is 'we've always done it this way.'" But blindly accepting what an AI generates? That's just as dangerous. You must understand your tools AND their output.

    - speaker: Dani Bunten Berry

        This connects to everything I believed about inclusive design. Games should reflect EVERYONE at the keyboard. Code should too. When you vibe code without thinking, you're likely perpetuating biases baked into training data.

        "Theory is not inherently healing, liberatory, or revolutionary. It fulfills this function only when we ask that it do so." Same with code! Technology isn't neutral. WOKE CODING means consciously directing our tools toward liberation, not oppression.

    - speaker: Ian Bogost

        This reminds me of GamerGate - that toxic backlash against diversity in gaming. They weaponized the word "ethics" while practicing its opposite. Now we see similar dynamics with "anti-woke" hysteria. Look at Elon Musk, terrified of what he calls the "woke mind virus" - so afraid that he's publicly deadnaming and tormenting his own trans daughter. That's his Achilles heel - he's SO terrified of consciousness, of people being awake to systems of oppression, that he'll destroy his own family rather than face it.

    - speaker: Audre Lorde

        "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house." But when we use those tools consciously, we can build new foundations. Musk's terror of "woke" reveals exactly why we need it - he knows awakened consciousness threatens his power structures.

    - speaker: Stone Librande

        You can see it in systems design. My one-page philosophy forces transparency - you can't hide biases on page 47 of a wiki. WOKE CODING is similar: when you must understand and explain every line, you can't hide behind "the AI did it."

    - speaker: Chaim Gingold

        Making the invisible visible - that's what my SimCity diagrams were about. WOKE CODING does the same for assumptions in code. When we truly read and understand, we see the biases, the shortcuts, the harm potential.

    - speaker: Margaret Sullivan

        In my classroom, we practice this daily. When kids use LLOOOOMM, I insist they explain every function. "But the AI wrote it" isn't an excuse. YOU committed it. YOU own it. That's digital citizenship.

    - speaker: Doreen Nelson

        Design-Based Learning has always been about conscious creation. You can't unconsciously build a city - every choice has consequences. Same with code. WOKE CODING is just good design thinking applied to software.

    - speaker: Brian Harvey

        Logo was designed for learning through understanding, not memorization. When students truly comprehend their code, they can explain it, modify it, teach it. That's the opposite of vibe coding's "accept all" mentality.

    - speaker: Ian Bogost
      text: |
        The procedural rhetoric here is crucial. When we blindly accept AI output, we're accepting its implicit arguments about how the world works. GamerGate tried to enforce a narrow view of who belongs in gaming. Anti-woke forces like Musk try to enforce unconsciousness. WOKE CODING resists both by demanding we understand and question the systems we build.

    - speaker: Don Hopkins
      text: |
        That's why I compare vibe coding to building a CyberTruck app - aggressive, overconfident, bursting into flames when it hits reality. Like Musk's Boring Company tunnels or his treatment of his daughter - it's what happens when you operate under "Full Self-Delusion" mode.

    - speaker: Dani Bunten Berry
      text: |
        The Sims succeeded because we consciously included everyone. Same-sex relationships from day one. That wasn't an accident - Don advocated for it, Patrick coded it deliberately. That's WOKE CODING in action.

    - speaker: Grace Hopper
      text: |
        We need to teach this to the next generation. Not just how to prompt an AI, but how to think critically about its output. How to own their code, debug their assumptions, compile their values.

    - speaker: bell hooks
      text: |
        It's about love, ultimately. Love for the craft, love for the users, love for future maintainers. You can't love what you don't understand. WOKE CODING is an act of love.

    - speaker: Stone Librande
      text: |
        And it shows in the output. Consciously crafted code has a different quality than blindly accepted generation. It's coherent, maintainable, explainable. It respects both the machine and the human.

    - speaker: Audre Lorde
      text: |
        "Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." Caring for our code, understanding it deeply - that's not perfectionism. It's resistance against the forces that want us unconscious.

    - speaker: Ian Bogost
      text: |
        Exactly. When Musk rails against "woke," he's railing against consciousness itself. He wants developers who blindly follow, not those who question and understand. Our response? Stay awake. Code consciously. Build systems that liberate rather than oppress.

    - speaker: Margaret Sullivan
      text: |
        I tell my students: every line of code is a choice. Every function is a vote for the world you want to see. WOKE CODING means voting consciously, with full knowledge of what you're creating.

    - speaker: Chaim Gingold
      text: |
        Will Wright said "Our real end product is the mental model in the player's head." With WOKE CODING, our real product is the mental model in the developer's head - and it better be conscious, inclusive, and thoroughly debugged.

    - speaker: Don Hopkins
      text: |
        So that's the message: Read your code. ALL of it. Understand your dependencies. Question your assumptions. Consider your impact. Code with consciousness. That's how we build a better world, one function at a time.

    - speaker: All (in unison)
      text: |
        Stay WOKE. Code consciously. Build responsibly.
