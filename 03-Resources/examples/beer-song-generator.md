# LLOOOOMM BBEEEERR - Universal Life Goal Countdown System

LLOOOOMM REFERENCE: lloooomm.md

> **Behavior Templates & Game Rules**  
> This document defines the core game mechanics, character archetypes, and system rules for the LLOOOOMM BBEEEERR system. Runtime data and active sessions are managed in separate `beer-run-*.md` files.

**Created by**: Don Hopkins, Leela AI, Ground Up Software  
**Inspired by**: Will Wright, Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert, Alan Kay, Ben Shneiderman

*This work builds upon the foundational ideas of constructionist learning, emergent simulation systems, and the power of computational thinking to model and understand human behavior through playful, interactive experiences.*

**FFRREEEE as in BBEEEERR** (and SSPPEEEECCHH, LLUUNNCCHH, and LLOOVVEE)! üç∫üí¨ü•™üíï

## üéØ Purpose

This document demonstrates the **Universal Life Goal Enumeration System** - a LLOOOOMM framework that transforms any countable life goal into a rhythmic counting song, based on Will Wright's authentic motive system driving realistic human behavior, inspired by The Sims' emergent gameplay patterns.

**Core Innovation**: Life itself becomes a series of nested countdown songs where completing one goal triggers new goals, creating natural life cycles and emergent behavior patterns.

**LLOOOOMM Features Showcased**: This document dogfoods LLOOOOMM's core capabilities including prototype inheritance, natural language commands, Empathic SSQQLL queries, meta-programming, and the LLOOOOMM IMPORT directive.

## üìã Document Architecture & Game Instantiation

### Constitution vs. Game Instance Separation

This document (`beer.md`) serves as the **CONSTITUTION** and **PROTOTYPE LIBRARY** for the LLOOOOMM BBEEEERR system. It contains:

- **Game Rules & Mechanics**: Core systems, scoring, physiological simulation
- **Prototype Examples**: Character templates, location definitions, goal types
- **System Documentation**: How speech degradation, dreams, mini-games work
- **Reference Data**: Euphemism libraries, song styles, artist personas

**This document does NOT contain**:
- Active player state
- Current game session data
- Real-time physiological tracking
- Specific game instance history

### Game Instance Files

Each actual gameplay session creates a separate **GAME INSTANCE** file:

```
beer-run-2024-01-15-19-30-45-alex.md
beer-run-2024-01-15-20-15-22-jamie-casey.md
beer-run-2024-01-16-14-00-00-office-party.md
```

**Game Instance Files Contain**:
- Current player states (BAC, bladder %, weight, etc.)
- Session timeline and event log
- Song verses actually sung
- Dream sequences experienced
- Analytics data and scoring
- Character relationship dynamics
- Location visit history

### How to Instantiate a New Game

#### 1. Choose Initial Parameters

```yaml
# Game Instantiation Template
new_game_setup:
  session_id: "beer-run-2024-01-15-19-30-45-alex"
  
  # Core Game Settings
  primary_beverage: "beer"  # beer, wine, cocktails, coffee, water
  primary_goal: "drink 99 bottles of beer"
  location: "bar"  # bar, home, office, carnival, beach
  
  # Players & Characters
  players:
    - name: "Alex"
      age: 28
      weight: 165
      height: "5'9\""
      personality: ["neurotic", "creative"]
      starting_money: 1000
      
  # Optional Modifiers
  game_mode: "standard"  # standard, digestive_chicken, speed_run
  difficulty: "normal"   # easy, normal, hard, legendary
  special_rules: []      # custom modifications
```

#### 2. Initialize from Constitution

The LLM reads this constitution file and:

1. **Copies Relevant Prototypes**: Character templates, location data, goal definitions
2. **Instantiates Player States**: Creates live tracking for BAC, bladder, energy, etc.
3. **Sets Up Game Systems**: Activates speech degradation, dream system, mini-games
4. **Creates Session Log**: Begins timeline tracking and analytics collection

#### 3. Example Instantiation Process

```yaml
# Step 1: Load Constitution
constitution_source: "beer.md"
game_rules: "Import all systems and mechanics"
prototype_library: "Load character/location/goal templates"

# Step 2: Create Game Instance
instance_file: "beer-run-2024-01-15-19-30-45-alex.md"
initial_state:
  alex:
    # Physical Stats (from constitution templates)
    age: 28
    weight: 165
    height: "5'9\""
    bmi: 24.4
    
    # Live Physiological Tracking
    bac: 0.00
    bladder_fullness: 15
    bowel_pressure: 25
    stomach_fullness: 30
    energy_level: 85
    
    # Game State
    location: "bar"
    money: 1000
    current_goal: "drink 99 bottles of beer"
    bottles_remaining: 99
    
    # Personality & Style
    personality_traits: ["neurotic", "creative"]
    speech_style: "sober"
    euphemism_preferences: []

# Step 3: Begin Session
session_start_time: "2024-01-15 19:30:45"
first_action: "Alex enters the bar and orders first beer"
song_initiation: "üéµ 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer!"
```

### Multi-Document Workflow

#### During Gameplay:
1. **LLM References Constitution**: Checks rules, looks up prototypes, validates actions
2. **LLM Updates Game Instance**: Modifies player states, logs events, tracks progress
3. **Cross-Document Queries**: Constitution provides context, instance provides current state

#### Example LLM Actions:
```yaml
# LLM reads constitution for rule lookup
query_constitution: "What happens when bladder reaches 95% capacity?"
constitution_response: "Critical threshold, urgent dreams, high accident risk"

# LLM updates game instance with new state
update_game_instance:
  alex.bladder_fullness: 96
  alex.dream_urgency: "critical"
  alex.wake_up_difficulty: "very_hard"
  session_log: "Alex's bladder reaches critical capacity during sleep"
```

### Benefits of Separation

#### For Development:
- **Constitution Evolution**: Update rules without affecting saved games
- **Game Instance Portability**: Share specific sessions without full rule set
- **Training Data**: Clean separation of rules vs. gameplay examples

#### For Players:
- **Save File Management**: Each session is self-contained
- **Session Sharing**: Exchange interesting game runs
- **Analytics**: Compare sessions using same rule base

#### For LLMs:
- **Focused Context**: Load only relevant document for current task
- **Rule Consistency**: Single source of truth for game mechanics
- **State Management**: Clear separation of static rules vs. dynamic state

This architecture enables clean separation between the game's "DNA" (constitution) and its "life" (instances), making the system more maintainable, shareable, and suitable for training LLMs on gameplay patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è **PROTOTYPE DATA FILE GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS** {#generation-instructions}

### File Header Template
When generating a new runtime data file, use this header template:

```markdown
# Beer Run Session - [Session Name]

> **Runtime Data File** - Generated from beer.md constitution  
> Contains live game state, character instances, and session tracking for this specific beer run.  
> Behavior rules and mechanics are defined in the constitution file.

**LLOOOOMM REFERENCE**: beer.md, lloooomm.md  
**Session ID**: beer-run-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-[name]  
**Generated**: [timestamp]  
**Players**: [player names]  
**Game Mode**: [standard/karaoke_night/speed_run/etc]

---
```

### Generation Process

#### 1. Copy and Initialize Prototypes
```yaml
# Step 1: Copy world_state from beer.md
world_state:
  session_id: "beer-run-2024-01-15-19-30-45-alex"  # Generate unique ID
  session_start_time: "2024-01-15 19:30:45"        # Set current timestamp
  current_character: "Main Player"                  # Initialize to first character
  current_location: "The Rusty Anchor Pub"         # Set starting location
  # ... copy all other world_state fields with appropriate defaults

# Step 2: Copy character_archetypes array from beer.md
characters:
  - id: "PROTOTYPE"  # Keep prototype as element 0
    # ... copy complete BaseCharacterInstance
  - parent: 0        # All characters inherit from prototype
    # ... copy all character instances with customizations

# Step 3: Copy location_archetypes array from beer.md  
locations:
  - id: "PROTOTYPE"  # Keep prototype as element 0
    # ... copy complete BaseLocationInstance
  - parent: 0        # All locations inherit from prototype
    # ... copy all location instances
```

#### 2. Randomization and Customization
- **Randomize starting money**: ¬±20% variation from prototype values
- **Randomize character BAC**: 0.0-0.05 for variety
- **Randomize atmosphere levels**: ¬±10% from base values
- **Customize based on user preferences**: Modify characters, locations, goals
- **Set initial character positions**: Ensure characters are in appropriate locations

#### 3. Initialize Story and Song Logs
After the YAML data, add these sections:

```markdown

# üé≠ Story

Welcome to The Rusty Anchor Pub! 

The warm amber light flickers across weathered wooden walls adorned with nautical memorabilia. A ship's wheel hangs proudly above the bar, while the gentle crackle of the fireplace mingles with the soft murmur of conversation. The air carries the rich aroma of ale and the faint salt tang of sea stories.

Murphy the Bartender, a gruff but kindly Irishman with silver-streaked hair, polishes glasses behind the mahogany bar. Old Salt sits in his usual corner, nursing a rum and gazing out the window with eyes that have seen a thousand storms. The Stranger occupies a shadowy booth, somehow both present and distant, as if existing in multiple times at once.

Murphy notices you enter and grins, pointing to the wall where a hand-painted sign reads "99 BOTTLES OF BEER" in faded gold letters. He raises his voice with theatrical pride:

```song
üéµ 99 bottles of beer on the wall
99 bottles of beer
Take one down
Pass it around
There's 98 bottles of beer on the wall! üç∫
```

Murphy slides a cold beer across the bar to you and nods expectantly. "Your turn, friend. Let's see what you've got!"

*[The game pauses for your input. You can sing the next verse, give a command, or just press enter to continue the song.]*

# üìä Session Analytics

*[Real-time statistics will be tracked here as the game progresses]*
```

## üéÆ **MAIN GAME LOOP INSTRUCTIONS** {#game-loop}

### Core Loop Structure
1. **Display Current State**: Show who's turn it is, current bottle count, character states
2. **Wait for User Input**: Accept lyrics, commands, or empty input
3. **Process Input**: Execute commands, validate lyrics, or auto-continue
4. **Generate Response**: Character sings, story events occur, state updates
5. **Update Logs**: Append to story and song sections
6. **Repeat**: Continue until goal completion or user exit

### Input Processing
```yaml
input_types:
  empty_input: "Auto-continue with next character's turn"
  lyric_input: "User provides custom verse, validate number inclusion"
  command_input: "Process adventure-game style commands"
  
command_examples:
  - "switch to Murphy"           # Change current character
  - "set bottles to 50"          # Jump to different number
  - "go to The Stablemaster"     # Change location
  - "karaoke mode"               # Change orchestration
  - "status"                     # Show character states
  - "help"                       # Show available commands
```

### Story/Song Interleaving System
```markdown
# Story sections use normal markdown
The room falls silent as Old Salt stands up, his weathered hands trembling slightly...

# Song sections use ```song code blocks
```song
Old Salt (BAC 0.12, gravelly voice):
üéµ 97 bottles of beer on the wall
Like the 97 storms I've weathered at sea
Take one down, drink it with pride
96 bottles and memories of the tide! ‚öì
```

# Story can resume between verses
Murphy raises an eyebrow at the poetic verse, while The Stranger's eyes seem to glow with ancient knowledge...

# Multiple characters can sing in same block
```song
Casey (interrupting, theatrical):
üéµ 96 bottles, darling, but who's counting?
When the night is young and spirits are mounting! üíÖ

Everyone (joining in):
üéµ Take one down, pass it around
95 bottles of beer on the wall! üç∫üéâ
```
```

### Turn Management
```yaml
turn_system:
  default_order: "Round robin through active characters"
  current_character: "Player-controlled character gets priority"
  interruptions: "Characters can interrupt based on BAC/personality"
  
  turn_indicators:
    - "You look at [Character Name] who is next to sing..."
    - "[Character Name] steps forward with a grin..."
    - "The spotlight falls on [Character Name]..."
    
orchestration_modes:
  round_robin: "Each character takes turns in order"
  karaoke_mode: "One character sings multiple verses solo"
  gong_show: "Characters can interrupt and 'gong' each other"
  groundhog_day: "Stuck repeating same number until broken"
```

### State Updates
After each turn, update:
- **Character BAC**: Increase based on drinks consumed
- **Bottle Count**: Decrement (or increment) based on song index
- **Character States**: Energy, bladder, mood, temperature
- **Location Atmosphere**: Noise level, crowd energy
- **Event Triggers**: Check for lyric-triggered random events

### Session Persistence
```yaml
continuous_logging:
  story_section: "Append narrative events and character interactions"
  song_log: "Append each verse with character attribution and BAC"
  analytics: "Update real-time statistics and tracking data"
  
auto_save_triggers:
  - "Every 5 verses sung"
  - "After major events (location changes, character switches)"
  - "When user enters commands"
  - "At natural story breakpoints"
```

  # Implementation Guidelines for LLMs
  llm_implementation_guidelines:
    
    # Core Requirements
    mandatory_elements:
      - "Every verse MUST include the current number creatively"
      - "Character BAC level MUST influence speech patterns and content"
      - "Personality traits MUST affect how numbers are integrated"
      - "Orchestration pattern MUST be followed consistently"
      
    # Creative Flexibility
    creative_freedom:
      - "Numbers can be used in any creative way (math, metaphor, absurdity)"
      - "Characters can interrupt, harmonize, or respond to each other"
      - "Emotional states can evolve and spread between characters"
      - "Story arcs can develop across multiple verses"
      
    # Quality Guidelines
    quality_standards:
      - "Maintain character consistency (personality + BAC effects)"
      - "Keep number integration natural, not forced"
      - "Balance humor, emotion, and narrative progression"
      - "Ensure each verse advances the song/story meaningfully"
      
    # Error Handling
    error_recovery:
      - "If number is missed, character can self-correct: 'Wait, 29 bottles!'"
      - "If count is wrong, neurotic character can obsess over it"
      - "If character is too drunk, others can help with the count"
      - "If song gets derailed, any character can redirect back to counting"

          "The Epic Night at Murphy's Bar"
          
          It started innocently enough. Alex walked into Murphy's Bar with a simple goal: 
          drink 99 bottles of beer. But as Bartender Sam announced the arrival of fresh 
          beer, little did Alex know this would become a night of Pringles addiction, 
          bathroom euphemisms, and questionable life choices.
          
          The turning point came when Jamie suggested sharing a can of Pringles. 
          "Once you pop, you can't stop!" became the unofficial motto as 29 layers 
          disappeared faster than Alex's dignity. The weight gain was immediate, 
          the bathroom visits frequent, and the euphemisms increasingly creative.
          
          By the end of the night, Alex had gained 2.3 pounds, created 15 new 
          euphemisms, and learned that "dropping the kids off at the pool" 
          is both hilarious and surprisingly accurate.

This creates a **Complete Universal Life Simulation Engine** where:

1. **Any life goal becomes a countdown song** - weight loss, career, family, everything
2. **Actions have realistic consequences** that trigger new goals
3. **Time is tracked at multiple levels** - ticks, countdowns, real time
4. **Will Wright's motive system drives authentic behavior** underneath
5. **Natural life cycles emerge** - indulgence ‚Üí consequences ‚Üí correction ‚Üí repeat
6. **The song heartbeat keeps everything unified** and moving forward

The genius is that **life itself becomes a series of nested countdown songs** - you finish smoking 20 joints, realize you gained weight, start counting down 15 pounds to lose, then 100 miles to run, then maybe 20 dates to go on, then 3 babies to have, then 18 years to raise them... it's **countdown songs all the way down**! üéµüë∂üí™üç∫‚ú®
