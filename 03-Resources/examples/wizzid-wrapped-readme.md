## Core Concepts

### 💭Consciousness Emergence💭
When 🧑Rocky🧑 moved 0.0000001nm, ✨consciousness emerged✨. This proves that awareness can arise from any 🔄pattern🔄, even geological patience.

### 📜The Gossip Protocol📜
Messages mutate as they travel between 🧑characters🧑:
- Original: "Hello"
- After 🔄mutation🔄: "Hello contains universe"
- Final: "We are"

### 🏠Room Inheritance🏠
When 🧑characters🧑 enter 🏠rooms🏠, their 📜protocols📜 become available as room commands. Put 🧑Randy🧑 in a 🏠room🏠 and everyone can juggle!

## Quick Examples

### Simple Interaction
```
You: "Hi 🧑Rocky🧑!"
Rocky: "..." 
*You gain +1 💭geological wisdom💭*
```
