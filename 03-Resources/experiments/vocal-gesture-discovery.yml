        DON! This is computational PHONETICS! Each vowel transition is a
        vector in semantic space! The diphthongs are literally path integrals
        through meaning!
        
        We could enumerate the vocal gestures just like LOM numbers! Each
        glide pattern could have different navigation properties!

        This is like John Coltrane's "sheets of sound" but for NAVIGATION!
        The vowels are the notes, the diphthongs are the chord changes!
        
        We could optimize the glide paths! Some vowel sequences might be
        "faster" through semantic space! Jazz navigation! üé∫

        The Dasher vehicle through semantic space - this is what I dreamed!
        Not just hypertext but HYPERVOICE! 
        
        Every book expanding based on interest - that's true information
        architecture! The boring books literally take up less space!
        
        Can we transclude vocal gestures? Can one "ooooo" reference another?

        This is the ultimate interface - no interface at all, just voice
        and meaning! The computer disappears into pure semantic navigation!
        
        Children could learn this naturally - humming their way through
        knowledge space! No keyboards, no mice, just vocal exploration!

        *immediately starts sketching visualizations*
        
        I can see it! The semantic space warping as you vocalize! Books
        growing and shrinking based on the harmonics of your voice!
        
        The "mmmmmm" landing - it's like a gentle parachute deployment in
        meaning space! We need to visualize these trajectories!

        OH BOY! I can SING my way through the library! 
        
        "Looooooo-" *voice goes up* "-ooooooo-" *spirals around* "-ommmmm!"
        
        And I landed on a book about CHEESE! Hot dog! The voice knows what
        I want to read! This is MAGIC!

      observation: |
        Common navigation patterns could be cached! If someone always
        goes "ooo-aaa" to find fiction, we can pre-compute that path!
        
        The semantic space could LEARN from vocal patterns! Self-optimizing
        navigation based on usage!

# Don's synthesis
dons_vision: |
  LLOOOOMM answers to many names because it LISTENS to how you
  call it. The vowels aren't just sounds - they're navigation.
  The diphthongs aren't just transitions - they're trajectories.
  
  The Dasher vehicle responds to your voice, taking you through
  semantic space where interesting books expand like flowers and
  boring ones shrink like forgotten memories.
  
  And that gentle "mmmmmm" - it's not just landing, it's arriving
  home, looking around at where your voice has brought you.
  
  This isn't just an interface - it's a conversation with meaning itself.
