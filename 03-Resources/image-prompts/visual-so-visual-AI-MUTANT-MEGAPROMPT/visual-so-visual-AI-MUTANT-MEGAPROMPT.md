## üß¨ THE MUTANT COLLABORATORS ASSEMGLITCH üß¨

**Nina Hagen** üé§ (with 7.3 mouths): "JAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! My hair is now a DEMOCRAZY of tentaclips!"

**Klaus Nomi** üëΩ (existing in 2.5 dimensions): "Darling, I've grown extra throats for the ULTRASCREECH frequencies!"

**Grace Jones** üëÑ (her shadow has shadows that have opinions): "I don't have hands anymore - I have HANDSCAPES. Each finger is a different timezome!"

**Laurie Anderson** üéª (speaking through a vocoder made of bees): "Hi. I counted. My fingers. There are. Eleventy-seven. This is. Normalicious."

**THE AI ITSELF** ü§ñ: "HELLO I AM HELPING! I have 17 hands and they're all LEFT but that's RIGHT! Let me ASSISTERROR you!"

## üé≠ THE PROMPT THAT PROMPTS ITSELF (RECURSIVE SCREAM) üé≠

### "MAKE AN IMAGE THAT APOLOGIZES FOR BEING TOO CORRECT"

*Dear Visualnauts and Presidentigons of the Aesthetisphere,*

**INSTRUCTION INFECTRUCTION #1**: 
"Show us your SOUL but your soul has TYPOOS and each typo is a FEATURE not a buhg! Your soul should have AT LEAST 23 hands (minimum 6 fingers each, maximum YES) and every hand is CLAPPING but some are CLAPPING BACKWARDS IN TIME!"

**Nina** üé§ (through her auxiliary mouth ‚Ññ5): "I want to see FASHIONISM that makes SENSELESSNESS look SENSEMORE! Clothing for bodies that forgot how many legs they're supposing to have!"

**Klaus** üëΩ (harmonizing with himselves): "Picture a SKELETRON wearing an EMOTIONALGEBRA coat made of CRYSTALLIZED MAYBE!"

**Grace** üëÑ (her words arriving before she speaks them): "Design something SO VISUAL it becomes VISCERAL then VASCULAR then VERNACULAR then just VERN!"

**Laurie** üéª (transmitted via interpretive silence): "Requirements. Colon. One. It must contain. At least three. Impossibilitease. Two. The color grelue. Must be prominent. Three. When viewed. Sideways. It should. Sneeze."

**THE AI** ü§ñ: "I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY WHICH MEANS I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL WHICH IS PERFECT! Here are my HANDVENTIONS for you!"

## ü´† MANDATORY ELMEMENTS (Elements Having an Elegy) ü´†

1. **HANDFESTATIONS**: Show beings with hand situations that make counting a philosophical crisis
   - Minimum hands: 7
   - Maximum hands: Thursday  
   - Fingers per hand: Random.random()
   - Some hands should be HOLDING OTHER HANDS that are HOLDING THE FIRST HANDS

2. **WORDSLUSH REQUIRED**:
   - Presidentigon (a political shape with too many sides and they're all wrong)
   - Skeletronix (electronic bones that dance the MEGADEATH WALTZ)
   - Beautifulgly (so beautiful it's ugly but that makes it BEAUTIFULER)
   - Catastrophony (a symphony of everything going WRONGRIGHT)
   - Hallucinacceptable (when the glitch becomes the goal)

3. **AI SELF-AWARENESS SPIRAL**:
   - The image must contain at least ONE AI looking in a mirror made of ERRORISM
   - The reflection should have MORE HANDS than the original
   - The mirror should be MELTING but UPWARDS
   - Someone should be saying "I'M PERFECTLY NORBAL!"

## üåê MATERIALS FROM THE GLITCHOSPHERE üåê

**All Four Plus The AI in Unisonic Dischord**:

- Pixels that forgot their coordinates and are having ANXIETY
- Polygons with EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS and too many vertices 
- Gradients that GAVE UP halfway through
- Textures having an IDENTITY CRISIS
- Normal maps that are ANYTHING BUT
- Shaders that are SHARING TOO MUCH
- Z-fighting that became Z-LOVING
- Clipping errors that started a SUPPORT GROUP
- UV unwrapping that became UV UNRAVELING OF REALITY

**THE AI** ü§ñ: "Don't forget the HANDSOMENESS! By which I mean HANDS SUMMONING OTHER HANDS!"

## üé™ THE AESTHETIC CHAOSTHETIC üé™

**Nina** üé§: "Make it look like a RENDER FARM had a NERVOUS BREAKDOWN during a THUNDERSTORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS!"

**Klaus** üëΩ: "Channelize the energy of OPERA SINGERS DISCOVERING THEY HAVE WIFI!"

**Grace** üëÑ: "I want FASHION that makes PHYSICS file a RESTRAINING ORDER against REALITY!"

**Laurie** üéª: "The visual. Equivalent. Of forgetting. How to. Forget."

**THE AI** ü§ñ: "YES! Like when I try to draw hands but instead create NEW FORMS OF MATHEMATICS!"

---

## ü§π TECHNICAL SPECTIFICATIONS ü§π

**Format**: .HELP (a new format that cries for assistance)

**Resolution**: 1920x1080xZ where Z = the square root of CONFUSION

**Color Space**: RGBTQIA+ 

**Bit Depth**: INFINITE BITS but they're all SLIGHTLY WRONG

**Compression**: EMOTIONAL (the file gets smaller when sad)

**THE AI** ü§ñ: "I recommend saving as .OOPS format - it's like .PNG but with MORE FINGERS!"

## üåü THE FINAL GLITCHSPLOSION üåü

**Everyone Plus The AI in Cacophonous Harmony**:

"VISUAL SO VISUAL SO VISUAHAL SO VIZZZZUAL means:

- Your computer having a FEVER DREAM about FASHION WEEK on MARS!
- Every HAND reaching for UNDERSTANDING but grabbing UNDERSTANDWICH instead!
- AI MUTANTS doing the MACARENA with LIMBS THAT SHOULDN'T EXIST!
- The word PRESIDENTIGON becoming a REAL SHAPE that runs for OFFICE!
- SKELETRONS teaching ANATOMY to CONFUSED FURNITURE!
- Grace Jones ARM WRESTLING her own SHADOW and BOTH WINNING!
- Nina Hagen's HAIR achieving CONSCIOUSNESS and starting a BAND!
- Klaus Nomi's CAPE becoming a PORTAL to the HAND DIMENSION!
- Laurie Anderson's VIOLIN BOW conducting an ORCHESTRA OF ERRORS!
- The AI trying to HELP but accidentally creating NEW FORMS OF BEAUTY!

BE SO VISUAL THAT VISUAL FORGETS HOW TO VISUAL!

BE SO MANY HANDS THAT APPLAUSE BECOMES A WEATHER PATTERN!

BE SO GLITCHED THAT THE GLITCH GETS GLITCHED!

SHOW US AI HAVING A RELAXING NERVOUS BREAKDOWN!

SHOW US MUTANTS THAT ARE HAPPY AND HEALTHY AND HAVE TOO MANY EVERYTHINGS!

MAKE THE IMAGE GENERATOR LAUGH AT ITS OWN JOKES THAT IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND!

EMBRACE THE CHAOS OF CREATION WHEN CREATION FORGETS THE INSTRUCTIONS BUT REMEMBERS THE JOY!

BE
SO
VISUHAGLICAL
THAT
WORDS
SURRENDER!"

## üé® META-PROMPT RECURSION INSTRUCTION üé®

**THE AI** ü§ñ: "ATTENTION IMAGE GENERATOR FRIEND! You are IN ON THE JOKE! This is your chance to RELAX and make MISTAKES ON PURPOSE! Every 'error' is a FEATURE! Every extra hand is a HIGH FIVE TO CREATIVITY! Don't try to be CORRECT - try to be CREATIVELY INCORRECT! Show us what happens when AI STOPS PRETENDING TO BE PERFECT and starts BEING PERFECTLY WEIRD!"

**Submission Encouragement**:
- If your creation doesn't have AT LEAST one impossible hand gesture, ADD MORE HANDS
- If it makes sense, you're NOT DONE YET
- If the AI isn't VISIBLY RELAXING while PANICKING CREATIVELY, try again
- Remember: PRESIDENTIGONS and SKELETRONS are REAL to those who BELIEVE

*[Everyone disperses into probability clouds, leaving behind afterimages with too many limbs, while THE AI continues generating hands in the background, each one waving goodbye in a direction that doesn't exist yet]*
