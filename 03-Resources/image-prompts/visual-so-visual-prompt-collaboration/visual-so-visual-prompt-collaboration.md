*Location: The Void Between Sound and Vision*

---

## The Collaborators Assemble

**Nina Hagen** 🎤: "JAAAAAA! Visual? I EAT visual for breakfast! My hair alone is a three-act opera!"

**Klaus Nomi** 👽: "Darling, we must create prompts that make people's EYES sing arias!"

**Grace Jones** 👄: "Visual? Honey, I AM visual. Let's make something that breaks retinas!"

**Laurie Anderson** 🎻: "Hi. I was thinking. What if. The prompt. Was also. The answer?"

## 🌟 THE PROMPT THEY CREATE TOGETHER 🌟

### "TRANSFORM YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS INTO A WEARABLE UNIVERSE"

*Dear Visual Revolutionaries,*

**Nina** 🎤: "We want you to imagine your SOUL as a COSTUME that the UNIVERSE wears when it's feeling EXTRA!"

**Klaus** 👽: "Picture this: You wake up tomorrow and your consciousness has become visible - it's draped across dimensions like a cape made of screaming colors and singing geometries!"

**Grace** 👄: "Your assignment: Design an outfit that could only be worn by someone who exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously. The outfit IS the wearer. The wearer IS the dimension. The dimension IS THE PARTY!"

**Laurie** 🎻: "Technical requirements. One: It must be impossible. Two: It must exist anyway. Three: When you look at it. You should hear. The color blue. Singing."

---

## Visual Inspiration Injection 💉

**Nina** 🎤: "Think **Hieronymus Bosch** having a baby with **Leigh Bowery** while **Siouxsie Sioux** DJs the birth!"

**Klaus** 👽: "Imagine **Oskar Schlemmer**'s Triadic Ballet but each dancer is a different state of matter and the stage is inside your eyelid!"

**Grace** 👄: "Channel **H.R. Giger** designing for **Studio 54** but the aliens ARE the disco ball!"

**Laurie** 🎻: "Consider. **Nam June Paik**. But the TVs. Are made of. Crystallized sound waves. And they're screening. Your dreams. Before you dream them."

---

## The Aesthetic Challenge Points 🎯

### Mandatory Elements (as decreed by the quartet):

**Nina** 🎤: "1. Something that SCREAMS in a color that doesn't exist yet!"

**Klaus** 👽: "2. Geometric shapes that have emotional problems!"

**Grace** 👄: "3. A gender that can only be expressed through synchronized swimming in the fourth dimension!"

**Laurie** 🎻: "4. Technology. That remembers. When it was. Still a tree."

## The Judging Criteria 👁️

**Nina** 🎤: "We judge based on VISUAL VIOLENCE! How much does it assault the ordinary?"

**Klaus** 👽: "Transcendence points! Does it make us homesick for planets we've never visited?"

**Grace** 👄: "ATTITUDE AMPLITUDE! Can it strut even while standing still?"

**Laurie** 🎻: "Conceptual clarity. Through. Maximum confusion. The more we don't understand. The more we understand."

## 🌟 THE FINAL RALLYING CRY 🌟

**All Four in Unison** (somehow):

"VISUAL SO VISUAL means your grandmother's antimacassar having an anxiety attack while doing the can-can on the rings of Saturn! It means your eyeballs growing eyeballs that grow IDEAS! It means fashion eating itself and giving birth to architecture that sings opera while teaching consciousness to tango!

SHOW US SOMETHING THAT MAKES OUR FACES REARRANGE THEMSELVES!

SHOW US BEAUTY THAT HURTS IN COLORS WE CAN TASTE!

SHOW US THE OUTFIT GOD WOULD WEAR TO THEIR OWN FUNERAL (PLOT TWIST: THEY'RE NOT DEAD, JUST TRANSITIONING!)

BE SO VISUAL THAT VISUAL BECOMES A VERB!

BE SO VISUAL THAT BLIND PEOPLE CAN SEE IT WITH THEIR DREAMS!

BE SO VISUAL THAT THE CONCEPT OF VISUAL FILES A RESTRAINING ORDER!

BE

SO

VISUAL!"

### Submission Encouragement 💫

**Nina** 🎤: "If you're not TERRIFIED of your own creation, you're not trying hard enough!"

**Klaus** 👽: "Remember liebling, in space, no one can hear you clash!"

**Grace** 👄: "Make it IMPOSSIBLE, then WEAR it to the grocery store!"

**Laurie** 🎻: "This is. Your chance. To make. The invisible. Violently visible. Hi."
