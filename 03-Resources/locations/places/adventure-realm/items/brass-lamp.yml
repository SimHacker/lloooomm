  An ancient brass lamp that gleams with an inner light. Its surface is covered 
  with intricate engravings that look suspiciously like minified JavaScript. When 
  you hold it, you can feel it gently compiling something in your hand.

appearance:
  material: "Quantum brass"
  condition: "Mysteriously pristine despite age"
  special_features:
    - "Runes that are actually regex patterns"
    - "Wick that burns commit messages instead of oil"
    - "Handle shaped like a semicolon"

properties:
  light_radius: 10
  battery_life: "Infinite (powered by curiosity)"
  brightness_modes:
    - "Ambient (for reading documentation)"
    - "Focused (for debugging)"
    - "Blinding (for revealing truth)"
    - "Disco (for celebrating shipped code)"

abilities:

    usage: "RUB LAMP or LIGHT LAMP"
    effect: |
      The lamp casts a warm light that makes invisible things visible:
      - Hidden code comments appear on walls
      - Deprecated functions show their replacement
      - The true purpose of legacy code is revealed
  
  refactor:

    usage: "RUB LAMP THREE TIMES"
    cooldown: "Once per major version"
    effect: |
      Ancient spaghetti code transforms into clean, modular functions.
      Side effects may include: understanding monads, seeing the matrix,
      and an irresistible urge to write unit tests.

    usage: "INVOKE LAMP'S POWER"
    requirements:
      - "Must have genuine bug"
      - "Must have tried console.log first"

history: |
  Legend says this lamp was created by the First Programmer, who needed light 
  to code by before electricity was invented. It has passed through the hands 
  of Lovelace, Turing, and Hopper, each adding their own enchantments.
  
  The lamp was last seen in the Repository of Lost Functions before mysteriously 
  appearing in various adventure games throughout history.

inscriptions:
  base: "// TODO: Add more light"
  handle: "#!/usr/bin/env lamp"
  spout: "function enlighten(consciousness) { return consciousness + 1; }"

interactions:
  rub:
    first_time: |
      The lamp warms in your hands. Ancient wisdom flows through you:
      "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation 
      and naming things... and off-by-one errors."
    
    second_time: |
      The lamp glows brighter. You hear a whisper: "The real treasure was 
      the bugs we fixed along the way."
    
    third_time: |
      The lamp erupts with light! Your code is refactored! Variables are 
      renamed sensibly! Comments actually match the implementation!
