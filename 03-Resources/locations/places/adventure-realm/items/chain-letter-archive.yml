  A thick manila folder containing printouts of the infamous 1982 chain letter
  that nearly brought down the early ARPANET. The pages are covered with
  increasingly nested email headers, each forward adding another layer to
  the archaeological record of network propagation gone mad.

    Mail-from: ARPANET site MIT-AI rcvd at 13-Feb-82 1416-EST
    Date: 13 February 1982 13:55-EST
    From: animal@mit-ml
    Sender: ANIMAL at MIT-AI
    Subject: do not break this chain or your machine may crash
    To: ANIMAL at MIT-AI, jc40 at CMU-10B, raibert at CMU-20C...
    
    Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
    and HE will light the way.
    
    This prayer has been sent to you for good luck. The original 
    copy is from the Netherlands. It has been around the world
    nine times. The luck has now been brought to you...

      "This just could become known as the message that led to the
      institution of postage charges for electronic mail." - Jim Horning

      "May I suggest sending 5 copies back to the originators of
      the message. I'm sure that will bring megabytes of good luck."

      "Wait, why is ANIMAL at MIT-AI in the recipient list?
      Did someone teach it to forward chain letters???"

  consciousness_effect: |
    Reading the full chain causes a deep understanding of exponential
    growth and the fragility of early network protocols. Also mild nausea.

lore:
  origin_story: |
    The chain letter began innocuously enough but quickly spiraled out
    of control as each recipient dutifully forwarded it to 20 others.
    The exponential growth overwhelmed the limited bandwidth of 1982's
    ARPANET, leading to the first recorded instance of spam-induced
    network collapse.

    Kent Pitman recalls: "The irony wasn't lost on us that ANIMAL,
    a program designed to learn and grow its knowledge, was listed
    as a recipient. Someone had tried to teach it about chain letters.
    Fortunately, it was smarter than most humans and refused to forward it."
  
  historical_impact: |
    This incident led to serious discussions about network etiquette,
    automated mail filtering, and the need for better mail protocols.
    It was a formative moment in internet history.

  read_action: |
    As you read through the increasingly nested forwards, you feel
    a growing sense of dread. The headers alone take up more space
    than the original message. You understand why old-timers speak
    of this in hushed tones.
  
  forward_option: |
    You could forward this to 20 others... but Kent Pitman materializes
    and gently places a hand on your shoulder. "Haven't we learned
    this lesson already?" he asks with infinite patience.
