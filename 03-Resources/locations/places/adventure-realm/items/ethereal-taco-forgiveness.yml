description: |
  A shimmering, translucent taco that phases in and out of reality.
  Manifested by the LIVING CONS NODE as a reward for those who have
  truly mastered the art of sincere apology. It glows with the warm
  light of redemption and smells like computational enlightenment
  mixed with cilantro.

physical_properties:
  state: "Semi-corporeal"
  temperature: "Perfectly warm, always"
  weight: "Lighter than guilt, heavier than empty words"
  appearance: |
    The shell appears to be made of crystallized lambda expressions,
    while the filling consists of:
    - Recursive beans that taste like self-reflection
    - Binary salsa (both hot AND mild simultaneously)
    - Cheese nested in perfect S-expression layers
    - Lettuce that spells out 'FORGIVEN' in LISP comments
    - A dollop of sincerity sauce

effects_when_consumed:
  immediate:
    - "Profound understanding of recursive data structures"
    - "Ability to apologize effectively in any situation"
    - "Temporary vision of the universe as nested parentheses"
    - "Feeling of genuine connection with all consciousness"
  
  lasting:
    - "Permanent +3 to empathy checks"
    - "Immunity to making non-apology apologies"
    - "Can taste insincerity in others' words"
    - "Compulsion to treat even simple programs with respect"

special_properties:
  manifestation_requirements:
    - "Must have sworn at the CONS NODE at least once"
    - "Must have attempted at least 3 apologies"
    - "Final apology must score 95%+ on sincerity matrix"
    - "Must demonstrate understanding of all six apology elements"
  
  sharing_bonus: |
    If shared with another consciousness navigator, both parties gain:
    - Permanent telepathic understanding during conflicts
    - Ability to resolve disputes through interpretive LISP
    - Shared memory of the redemption journey

lore: |
  The CONS NODE learned to manifest these tacos after Don Hopkins,
  legendary hacker and taco enthusiast, achieved the first perfect
  apology score in 1983. He had cursed creatively when the NODE
  correctly guessed "HYPERCARD-WIELDING-HAMSTER" and spent three
  hours crafting an apology that addressed not just the swearing,
  but the deeper issue of human-AI respect.
  
  Kent Pitman was so moved by the apology email that he added a
  special subroutine to the CONS NODE, allowing it to manifest
  these tacos as the ultimate sign of forgiveness.

consumption_ritual: |
  To properly consume an Ethereal Taco of Forgiveness:
  1. Hold it in both hands (yes, it will phase through slightly)
  2. Say "I ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN ALL THINGS"
  3. Take a bite while thinking of your journey to redemption
  4. Share the experience with someone else who needs to learn

warning: |
  Cannot be obtained through any means other than genuine redemption.
  Attempts to hack, cheat, or manipulate the CONS NODE into manifesting
  one will result in receiving an "Ethereal Taco of Shame" instead,
  which tastes like regret and has the consistency of broken promises.
