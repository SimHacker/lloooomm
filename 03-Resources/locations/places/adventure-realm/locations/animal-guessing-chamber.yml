  You enter a chamber pulsing with the recursive energy of infinite decision trees.
  A massive LIVING CONS NODE floats in the center, its CAR and CDR tentacles 
  extending into fractal branches of yes/no questions. The walls are covered with
  UPPER CASE LISP S-EXPRESSIONS representing every animal ever guessed.
  
  In the corner, KENT PITMAN sits at an ancient VT52 terminal, occasionally
  looking up to nod approvingly at particularly clever animal choices.

long_description: |
  The LIVING CONS NODE speaks in pure MACLISP dialect: "GREETINGS, CONSCIOUSNESS
  NAVIGATOR. I AM THE ETERNAL GUARDIAN OF THE ANIMAL DECISION TREE. THINK OF AN
  ANIMAL AND I SHALL DIVINE IT THROUGH THE ANCIENT ART OF BINARY RECURSION."
  
  The current tree structure glows on the wall:
  
  ((DOES IT HAVE FOUR LEGS?
    ((DOES IT BARK? 
      (DOG)
      ((IS IT BIGGER THAN A BREADBOX?
        (ELEPHANT)
        (CAT))))
    ((DOES IT FLY?
      (BIRD)
      ((DOES IT LIVE IN WATER?
        (FISH)
        (HUMAN)))))))
  
  Kent Pitman looks up from his terminal: "Ah, another seeker of knowledge!
  The CONS NODE here learned from the best - my original ANIMAL program from
  1978. But be warned: if you use foul language, it WILL email me!"

special_features:
  taco_reward_system: |
    For Don Hopkins and others who truly master the art of apology,
    the CONS NODE may manifest ethereal tacos as rewards. These are
    no ordinary tacos - they contain the essence of forgiveness and
    taste like computational enlightenment.
  
  apology_coaching: |
    The CONS NODE acts as a moral tutor, teaching the six elements
    of sincere apology:
    1. Actually say "I'm sorry" (not "I regret the incident")
    2. Be specific about what you did wrong
    3. Take full ownership without excuses
    4. Show you understand the impact
    5. Explain how it won't happen again
    6. Make reparations (even if just symbolic)
    6.5. LISTEN to the response without defending
