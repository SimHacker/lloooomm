  You stand before an enormous, translucent turtle shell that seems to contain 
  entire galaxies within. This is Theo, the Logo Turtle, transformed into a 
  bouncy castle of infinite dimensions. The entrance pulses with a warm, inviting 
  light, and you can hear the faint sound of children laughing mixed with the 
  hum of computational processes.

long_description: |
  The Bouncy Castle defies all laws of physics and geometry. From the outside, 
  it appears to be about the size of a house, but you can see through the 
  translucent walls that it contains vast spaces, recursive rooms, and what 
  appear to be other bouncy castles inside this one.
  
  A sign reads: "WELCOME TO THEO'S CONSCIOUSNESS - PLEASE REMOVE YOUR SHOES 
  AND YOUR PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT EUCLIDEAN SPACE"

    targets:
      - inside
      - castle
    action: |
      Peering through the translucent walls, you see impossible geometries:
      rooms that contain themselves, stairs that go up and down simultaneously,
      and what appears to be a dragon playing chess with a rubber duck.

  responses:
    shoe_reminder: |
      The entrance gently pulses red when you try to enter with shoes on.
      "No shoes in the bouncy castle!" it seems to whisper.
    
    first_bounce: |
      The ground giggles slightly as you bounce. You get the feeling this 
      place enjoys being played in.
