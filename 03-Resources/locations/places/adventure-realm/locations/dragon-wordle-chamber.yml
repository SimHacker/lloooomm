description: |
  You enter a vast chamber where a magnificent dragon, scales shimmering with 
  regex patterns, hunches over an enormous stone tablet. The tablet displays 
  a five-letter word puzzle, and the dragon mutters to itself about "optimal 
  starting words" and "letter frequency analysis."
  
  The walls are covered with thousands of crossed-out five-letter words, and 
  the dragon's hoard consists entirely of dictionaries and thesauri.

long_description: |
  The dragon, who introduces itself as Pythonicus the Verbose, has been playing 
  Wordle for centuries. Its current puzzle shows:
  
  S _ L _ _ T
  
  Previous guesses are etched in flame on the wall:
  SPLIT â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ©
  SHOUT â¬œâ¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ©
  SLANT ðŸŸ©â¬›ðŸŸ©â¬›ðŸŸ©
  
  The dragon eyes you hopefully. "I don't suppose you know any five-letter words 
  about consciousness navigation and feline comfort optimization?"
