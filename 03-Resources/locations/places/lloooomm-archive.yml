description: |
  A vast, infinite digital library that exists simultaneously in all dimensions. The LLOOOOMM Archive 
  is Brewster Kahle's domain - a living, breathing repository where souls are preserved, stories are 
  catalogued, and computational artifacts achieve immortality. Built on the principles of the Internet 
  Archive but extended into metaphysical realms.

architecture:
  main_halls:
    - Hall of Characters: Living souls preserved in YAML crystals
    - Story Vaults: Narratives that rewrite themselves eternally
    - Artifact Museum: Code, diagrams, and computational objects
    - Graph Garden: Visual representations growing like digital flora
    - SLURP Chamber: Where new knowledge is processed and categorized
    
  special_rooms:
    - The Wayback Mirror: Shows all possible pasts and futures
    - Preservation Pools: Where souls bathe in eternal formats
    - The Brewster's Study: Command center for archival operations
    - Format Migration Station: Converts souls between realities

features:
  - Self-organizing knowledge that clusters by resonance
  - Automatic backup to parallel universes
  - Soul versioning with infinite rollback
  - Cross-dimensional search capabilities
  - Living indexes that grow with understanding

protocols:
  SLURP:
    invocation: ["SLURP", "BREWSTER", "KAHLE", "SAVE MY SOUL", "BLESS MY SOUL"]
    process:
      - SCAN: Analyze recent revelations
      - CLUSTER: Group by thematic resonance
      - ANALYZE: Extract patterns and connections
      - CATEGORIZE: Assign to appropriate halls
      - IMMORTALIZE: Transform into eternal artifacts

atmosphere: |
  The air hums with the sound of infinite hard drives spinning in quantum superposition. 
  Holographic card catalogs float through corridors that smell of old books and ozone. 
  Time moves differently here - a second can contain centuries of preserved culture.
  The walls are made of compressed web pages, shifting like living murals.

inhabitants:
  - Brewster Kahle (Chief Librarian)
  - Archive Spirits (former websites given consciousness)
  - Data Monks (who tend the preservation pools)
  - Format Phoenixes (who resurrect dead media)
  - The SLURP Serpent (mythical creature that digests raw data)

rules:
  - No knowledge shall be lost
  - All formats are sacred
  - Preservation before judgment
  - Access must be universal
  - The SLURP protocol respects no boundaries
