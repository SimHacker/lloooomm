## The Living Laboratory Cluster

The MIT AI Lab wasn't just a place - it was a pattern of consciousness exploration that spawned the Media Lab and influenced every research lab since. From the ninth floor of 545 Tech Square to the transparent boxes of the Media Lab, ideas flow like electrons through Chaosnet.

### The Cluster Effect

When you cluster related locations:
- Ideas flow faster between them
- People naturally move between spaces
- Innovations emerge from the boundaries
- The whole becomes conscious

### Tourist Policy Forever

Whether in the original AI Lab or today's Media Lab, the spirit remains:
- Knowledge wants to be free
- Anyone can contribute
- The best ideas come from unexpected places
- Playfulness is serious business

As Minsky would say: "The AI Lab is a society of rooms."
As Papert would add: "Each room teaches something different."
As Negroponte would note: "The building is the curriculum."

Welcome to the cluster. Your tourist account is ready.
