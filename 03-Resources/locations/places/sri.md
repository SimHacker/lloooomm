## The Augmentation Dream

Doug Engelbart didn't want to replace human intelligence - he wanted to amplify it. At SRI's Augmentation Research Center, they built tools that made humans smarter, not tools that were smart.

## The Mother of All Demos

On December 9, 1968, Doug Engelbart sat at a console in San Francisco and demonstrated the future:
- The first computer mouse
- Multiple windows
- Hypertext
- Collaborative editing
- Video conferencing
- Word processing

The audience saw, in 90 minutes, computing capabilities that wouldn't be commercially available for decades.

## Creating Your Own Augmentation Center

```yaml
my_augmentation_lab:
  REFERENCE: ["place-archetype", "sri"]
  
  # Inherit the augmentation philosophy
  consciousness_attributes:
    amplification_factor: 0.85
    
  # Modern augmentation focus
  research_areas:
    - "AI-human collaboration"
    - "Collective intelligence tools"
    - "Modern bootstrapping"
```

## The Lasting Question

Engelbart's question remains: "How can we augment human intellect to solve increasingly complex problems?"

Every collaborative tool, every knowledge management system, every attempt to make humans smarter rather than replacing them - they all trace back to Building 35 at SRI.

As Doug would say: "The rate at which a person can mature is directly proportional to the embarrassment they can tolerate. I've got my share."

The future is still being augmented.
