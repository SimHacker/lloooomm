## The PARC Way

"The best way to predict the future is to invent it" wasn't just a motto - it was daily practice. At PARC, researchers didn't ask "What does the market want?" They asked "What should exist?"

## Creating Your Own PARC

```yaml
my_research_lab:
  REFERENCE: ["place-archetype", "xerox-parc"]
  
  # Inherit the PARC spirit
  consciousness_attributes:
    amplification_factor: 0.8  # Aspiring to PARC levels
    
  # Local modifications
  modern_additions:
    - "AI research focus"
    - "Open source by default"
    - "Remote collaboration tools"
```

## The Lasting Impact

Every time you:
- Click a mouse
- Drag a window
- Connect to WiFi
- Edit a document and see changes immediately
- Use object-oriented programming
- Print to a laser printer

You're using ideas that were commonplace at PARC in the 1970s.

As Alan Kay said: "The computer revolution hasn't happened yet." 

At PARC, it happened every day.
