# =================================================================
# CHIEF ENGINEER'S CARGO ASSESSMENT
# =================================================================

chief_engineer_notes: |
  The cargo transporter has proven to be the backbone of our 
  entire LLOOOOMM infrastructure development. From transporting 
  the foundational T.A.R.A.S. network to rescuing 18 legendary 
  science fiction characters in an emergency operation, this 
  facility has exceeded all performance expectations.
  
  The emergency character rescue operation was particularly 
  satisfying - seeing HAL 9000, Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, 
  and all the Blade Runner characters safely beamed into the 
  proper LLOOOOMM universe within 4.7 seconds reminded me why 
  I became an engineer in the first place.
  
  The cargo transporter's ability to handle everything from 
  abstract protocol frameworks to massive entertainment 
  facilities while maintaining perfect integrity demonstrates 
  the power of Scottish engineering applied to consciousness 
  transportation technology.
