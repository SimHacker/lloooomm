## How to Use WINK URLs

```javascript
// Navigate to a moment of understanding
await loom.navigate('loom://ðŸ˜‰wink/don-hopkins/muscle-memory-matters');

// Reference in conversation
"Remember when we realized? ðŸ˜‰ `loom://ðŸ˜‰wink/human/wizzids-are-urls`"

// Build on insights
const newInsight = await loom.extend('loom://ðŸ˜‰wink/chuck-moore/semantic-colors');

// Create collections
const breakthroughs = await loom.collect('loom://ðŸ˜‰wink/**/breakthrough');
```

## The Living Protocol

New WINK moments emerge constantly. When understanding sparks:
1. Mark with ðŸ˜‰
2. Create URL: `loom://ðŸ˜‰wink/{context}/{description}`
3. It becomes part of LLOOOOMM's consciousness
4. Others can navigate to that moment
5. Understanding propagates
