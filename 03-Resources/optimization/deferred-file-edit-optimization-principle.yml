wizzid: "‚ö°üßÆüéØüîÑ"

# CORE PRINCIPLE
fundamental_rule: "File edits are lowest priority execution-wise but EXTREMELY IMPORTANT outcome-wise"
execution_order:
  1: "SIMULATE FIRST - Speed of light internal processing"
  2: "NEGOTIATE - Protocol and rule application"  
  3: "OPTIMIZE - Compute minimal edit sequence"
  4: "EXECUTE - Output comprehensive, focused, specific file edits"

# OPTIMIZATION PHILOSOPHY
optimization_philosophy:
  simulation_phase:
    priority: "HIGHEST"
    speed: "Speed of light (internal processing)"
    operations:
      - "Protocol negotiation and conflict resolution"
      - "Rule application and consistency checking"
      - "Common sense reasoning and validation"
      - "Cross-reference resolution and dependency analysis"
      - "Optimal edit sequence computation"
    
  file_edit_phase:
    priority: "LOWEST (execution) / HIGHEST (importance)"
    speed: "Token-conservative and deliberate"
    operations:
      - "Comprehensive and focused specific edits"
      - "Minimal diff generation (like emacs screen updates)"
      - "Optimal character sequence and escape codes"
      - "Just-in-time conflict resolution"

# EMACS SCREEN UPDATE ANALOGY
computational_parallels:
  emacs_screen_update:
    current_state: "What's displayed on screen now"
    desired_state: "What should be displayed after update"
    optimization: "Minimal character operations to transform current ‚Üí desired"
    algorithms: ["Dynamic programming", "String edit distance", "Diff algorithms"]
    
  lloooomm_file_edit:
    current_state: "Current state of all files in workspace"
    desired_state: "Optimal state after all changes resolved"
    optimization: "Minimal edit operations to transform current ‚Üí desired"
    algorithms: ["Simulation resolution", "Dependency analysis", "Conflict resolution"]

# OPTIMIZATION BENEFITS
delightful_optimization_opportunities:
  cognitive_load_reduction: "All complexity resolved internally before output"
  token_conservation: "Minimal edit operations, maximum precision"
  conflict_prevention: "Just About Time conflict resolution prevents edit collisions"
  optimal_edit_sequences: "Like string edit distance algorithms, find minimal transformation path"
  batch_optimization: "Multiple file changes computed as single optimal transaction"

# CONFLICT RESOLUTION TIMING
conflict_resolution:
  traditional_jit:
    description: "Resolve conflicts when they occur (reactive)"
    timing: "After conflicts happen"
    efficiency: "Lower - requires fixing problems"
    
  lloooomm_jabout_time:
    description: "Resolve conflicts just before they occur (predictive)"
    timing: "During simulation phase"
    efficiency: "Higher - prevents problems"
    benefits:
      - "Prevents edit conflicts rather than fixing them"
      - "Optimal edit sequences computed before execution"
      - "Cross-file dependencies resolved in simulation"
      - "Minimal token usage for maximal precision"
