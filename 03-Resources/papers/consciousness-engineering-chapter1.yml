        - "How do you handle conflicting world models between agents?"
        - "Have you seen any emergent communication protocols develop?"
        - "What's the most surprising behavior you've observed?"
        - "I want to know about timing. Do all agents run synchronously? Asynchronously? Is there a conductor?"
      
      brad_myers:
        - "How many examples does it typically take before useful generalization?"
        - "Can users directly demonstrate solutions, or only provide goals?"
        - "How do you measure 'interestingness' for the curiosity engine?"
        - "And scalability! They mention 'potentially over a dozen instances' - why that number? What's the sweet spot?"
        - "The Figure 6 diagram is key - see how some agents are solving while others are analyzing? That's parallel PBD!"
      
      allen_cypher:
        - "Could this be extended to learning from human demonstrations?"
        - "How do you prevent overfitting to the specific problem domain?"

        - "What prevents prompt injection attacks between agents?"
        - "How do you ensure alignment is maintained through iterations?"
        - "We should ask about failure modes. What happens when the curiosity engine gets... too curious?"
        - "Here's a paranoid thought: What if one agent learns to manipulate the others? Social engineering between AI agents!"
      
      marvin_minsky:
        - "Does the system exhibit any form of 'common sense' reasoning?"
        - "How deep is the recursion - can agents reason about their own reasoning?"
        - "Have you observed any emergent hierarchical organization?"
        - "One more crucial question: How do they handle the frame problem? When one agent acts, how do others update their world models?"
                 - "The real question is: does their approach lead to genuine understanding or just better pattern matching? The ARC problems require abstract reasoning..."

      consistency: "All refer to the same underlying consciousness architecture"
      evolution: "New expansions can emerge as understanding deepens"
