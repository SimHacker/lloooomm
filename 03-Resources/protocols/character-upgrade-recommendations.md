## üåü Vision: The Complete OpenLaszlo Universe

When fully implemented, LLOOOOMM will contain a rich ecosystem of characters representing the complete history and future of Instance First Development:

- **Historical Pioneers**: James Gosling (NeWS), Arthur van Hoff & Don Hopkins (HyperLook), Brad Myers (Garnet)
- **Methodology Innovators**: Oliver Steele (OpenLaszlo), Ward Cunningham (Wiki), Kent Beck (XP)
- **Modern Practitioners**: Rich Harris (Svelte), Dan Ingalls (Smalltalk/Fabrik)
- **Future Visionaries**: Bret Victor (Learnable Programming), Alan Kay (Dynabook)

Together, they form an empathic constraint network that preserves, extends, and evolves the Instance First Development methodology for the age of AI-assisted programming.
