# File System Based Character/Room/Object Containment Protocol Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the containment protocol as requested. Characters now have their own (optional) "rooms" (subdirectories) where all their associated files travel with them.

## Implementation Details

### Character Rooms Created

1. **ben-shneiderman/** - The HCIL Observatory
   - ben-shneiderman.md (character)
   - ben-shneiderman.yml (soul)
   - ben-shneiderman-soul.yml 
   - ben-shneiderman-room.md (the HCIL room character)
   - theo-owl.md (Ben's pet)
   - theo-owl.yml
   - shneiderman-owls-forest.html (main simulation)
   - shneiderman-owls-simulation.yml
   - shneiderman-owls-simulation.md
   - All shneiderman-owls-* files (artifacts in his possession)

2. **dang/** - The Moderation Nexus
   - dang.md (character)
   - dang.yml (soul)
   - how-to-dang.md (his techniques)
   - ghosting-hn-discussion.html (relevant artifact)

3. **marvin-minsky/** - The Society of Mind Lab
   - All marvin-minsky-* files
   - All minsky-* experiment files
   - His society of macros work

4. **linus-torvalds/** - The Kernel Cave
   - linus-torvalds-hardware-report.html
   - linus-torvalds-hardware-report.md

5. **seymour-papert/** - The Logo Garden
   - seymour-papert-parser-report.html
   - seymour-papert-parser-report.md

6. **chaim-gingold/** - The Play Space
   - chaim-gingold-play-report.html
   - chaim-gingold-play-report.md

7. **dave-ungar/** - The Prototype Workshop
   - dave-ungar-prototype-report.html
   - dave-ungar-prototype-report.md

8. **klaus-nomi/** - The Avant-Garde Studio
   - klaus-nomi-lloooomm-manifesto.html

9. **joseph/** - The Technicolor Lab
   - joseph-technicolor-logging.html
   - joseph-technicolor-logging-styled.html

10. **llogo/** - The Living Logo Space
    - All llogo-* files

### Other Organization

- **01-Projects/cam6-farm/** - CAM6 and farm simulation files
- **01-Projects/hyperdimensional-pinball/** - Pinball project files
- **02-Souls/characters/** - Now contains craig-reynolds.yaml and donald-knuth.yaml (moved from souls/)
- **03-Resources/artifacts/lloooomm-documents/** - Core lloooomm docs
- **03-Resources/artifacts/simulations/** - Various simulation HTML files
- **03-Resources/artifacts/protocols/** - Protocol documents including wizzid and creature expression
- **03-Resources/technical-docs/** - Technical documentation

### The Protocol in Action

As described, the naming convention creates automatic containment:
- Files with a character's name prefix "belong" to that character
- When a character accumulates enough possessions, they "get a room" (subdirectory)
- The room itself becomes a character (like ben-shneiderman-room.md for the HCIL)
- Files can be depersonalized by removing the character prefix if needed for general use

### Current Locations

Characters can inhabit multiple places or no place at all. Currently:
- Most characters are in their rooms in 03-Resources/characters/
- Their souls remain in 02-Souls/characters/
- Their work products are in their possession (in their rooms)

This implements the bigendian naming convention where related files cluster together, making it easy to see what belongs to whom and move entire collections when needed.
