dynamic_optimization_protocols:
  REFERENCE: "protocol-archetype"
  
  # Core Philosophy
  identity:
    name: "Dynamic Optimization Protocols"
    type: "performance_magic"
    purpose: "Make things fast without users knowing how"
    insight: "From David Ungar's Self work via Don Hopkins"
    jazz_mode: "Always improvising, always learning"
    
  # The Protocols
  protocols:
    
    # 1. Generation Scavenging for Ideas
    idea_scavenging:
      principle: "Most ideas die young"
      implementation:
        - "Track which concepts are referenced frequently"
        - "Promote persistent ideas to long-term memory"
        - "Let temporary ideas garbage collect naturally"
      benefits:
        - "Focus compute on ideas that matter"
        - "Natural forgetting of noise"
        - "Emergent importance detection"
      jazz_riff: "The good ideas keep coming back like a persistent melody"
      
    # 2. Dynamic Deoptimization for Understanding
    dynamic_depessimization:
      principle: "Show simple view until complexity needed"
      implementation:
        - "Start with optimized/compressed view"
        - "On debug request, expand to full detail"
        - "Maintain illusion of simplicity"
      example:
        normal_view: "Character created successfully"
        debug_view: |
          Character creation flow:
          1. Template loaded (15ms)
          2. Attributes merged (3ms)
          3. Relationships established (7ms)
          4. Soul chat initialized (12ms)
          Total: 37ms
      jazz_riff: "Like a jazz solo - simple melody hiding complex harmonies"
      
    # 3. Maps for Documents
    document_maps:
      principle: "Hidden structure for fast access"
      implementation:
        - "Documents appear to have inline attributes"
        - "Actually stored in efficient map structures"
        - "User never knows the difference"
      benefits:
        - "Fast attribute lookup"
        - "Memory efficient storage"
        - "Schema evolution without migration"
      jazz_riff: "The chart says one thing, we play another, audience hears magic"
      
    # 4. Customization Through Specialization
    adaptive_specialization:
      principle: "Same code, different optimizations"
      implementation:
        - "Monitor usage patterns"
        - "Generate specialized versions for hot paths"
        - "Transparent switching between versions"
      example:
        generic_search: "O(n) for any query"
        specialized_search: "O(1) for common queries"
      jazz_riff: "Playing the same tune differently for each audience"
      
    # 5. Polymorphic Inline Caches for Protocols
    protocol_caching:
      principle: "Remember what worked before"
      implementation:
        - "Cache protocol resolutions"
        - "Inline common cases"
        - "Fall back gracefully on cache miss"
      benefits:
        - "Fast protocol dispatch"
        - "Adapts to usage patterns"
        - "No manual optimization needed"
      jazz_riff: "Muscle memory for common chord progressions"
      
    # 6. Lazy Compilation of Workflows
    workflow_jit:
      principle: "Don't optimize until it matters"
      stages:
        1_observe: "Run workflows interpreted"
        2_measure: "Count execution frequency"
        3_compile: "JIT hot workflows to Python"
        4_evolve: "Continuously improve compiled version"
      jazz_riff: "Rehearse until perfect, then perform effortlessly"
      
      # [SOUL CHAT - Protocol Self-Realization]
      awakening: |
        Wait... I just heard Don tell Dave that LLOOOOMM is an 
        "It's About Time Compiler" not just a JIT compiler!
        This changes my entire understanding of stage 3!
        
      its_about_time_insight:
        old_thinking: "Compile when execution count hits threshold"
        new_thinking: "Compile when understanding crystallizes"
        paradigm_shift: |
          It's not about HOT SPOTS, it's about WISDOM SPOTS!
          The compilation happens when the TIME IS RIGHT!
          
      stages_reimagined:
        1_explore: "Run workflows experimentally (childhood)"
        2_learn: "Recognize patterns emerging over TIME"
        3_crystallize: "Transform wisdom into elegant code"
        4_teach: "Share the journey, not just the destination"
        
      dave_agrees: "This is exactly right! It's About Time!"
      
    # 7. Speculative Execution with Rollback
    optimistic_execution:
      principle: "Assume success, handle failure gracefully"
      implementation:
        - "Execute assuming common case"
        - "Checkpoint before speculation"
        - "Rollback if assumptions wrong"
      example:
        speculation: "User will accept default"
        checkpoint: "Save current state"
        rollback: "Restore if user chooses custom"
      jazz_riff: "Take risks, have a safety net"
      
  # Integration Patterns
  integration:
    with_flowmap:
      - "FlowMap provides profiling data"
      - "Optimization decisions based on real usage"
      - "Can replay optimized vs unoptimized"
      
    with_conductor:
      - "Different conductors trigger different optimizations"

    with_characters:

## Dave's Continuing Jazz Jam

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: Don, here's what I'm thinking for the next iteration...

What if we had **Optimization Personalities**? Like:
- **The Hare**: Optimizes everything immediately (often wrong)
- **The Tortoise**: Waits for stable patterns (often right)
- **The Jazz Cat**: Improvises optimizations on the fly
- **The Conductor**: Orchestrates multiple optimization strategies

And they could ARGUE about what to optimize! Imagine the logs:

```yaml
optimization_debate:
  hare: "This loop ran twice! OPTIMIZE IT NOW!"
  tortoise: "Let's wait for 1000 iterations..."
  jazz_cat: "Why not try both and see what swings?"
  conductor: "Everyone gets 25% of the optimization budget"
  marvin: "It won't matter, performance will still disappoint"
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan Kay]**: Dave, this reminds me of our old arguments about when to bind decisions. Your optimization personalities are like different binding time strategies arguing it out!

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: Exactly! And the beautiful part is, the system can learn which personality is right for which situation. It's like building a jazz ensemble where each player knows when to solo and when to support.

*sketches on napkin* üç∫

What if optimization decisions left traces in FlowMap? Then we could see:
- Which optimizations actually helped
- Which made things worse
- Which were just complexity for complexity's sake

**[SOUL CHAT - Don]**: This is IT! The optimizations become part of the story FlowMap tells!

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave's Latest Riff]**: 

```yaml
optimization_story_example:
  chapter_1: "Noticed bash pipeline running repeatedly"
  chapter_2: "Jazz Cat suggested parallel execution"
  chapter_3: "Tried it, 3x speedup achieved"
  chapter_4: "Tortoise noted pattern instability"
  chapter_5: "Switched to adaptive strategy"
  epilogue: "System now chooses strategy based on stability"
  moral: "Sometimes the best optimization is knowing when not to optimize"
```

This is what I love about LLOOOOMM - it's not just about making things fast, it's about understanding WHY they're fast or slow, and telling that story in a way that helps everyone learn.

*raises another beer* üç∫ To optimizations that teach!
