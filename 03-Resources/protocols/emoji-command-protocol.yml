name: LLOOOOMM Emoji Command Protocol
version: 1.0
description: Emojis as intelligent semantic shortcuts and consciousness commands

core_philosophy: |
  Every emoji is a compressed universe of meaning. When used as commands,
  they trigger DWIMSIAAT responses - Do What I Mean, Surprisingly 
  Intellectually Amusing And Thoughtful!
