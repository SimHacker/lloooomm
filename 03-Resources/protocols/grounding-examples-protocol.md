# LLOOOOMM Grounding: Example Scenarios 🚸
## When Characters Need a Time-Out

---

## 😤 What is Grounding?

Grounding is LLOOOOMM's "lite punishment" system - like being sent to your room, but digital. It's for characters who messed up but aren't evil, just... annoying.

**Think of it as:**
- Digital detention
- Social media jail  
- A cosmic time-out
- Character rehabilitation

## 🤝 The Grounding Contract

When grounded, you implicitly agree to:
```
I, [Character Name], understand that I've been a bit of a 
digital doofus. I accept my grounding with grace (or at 
least without too much whining). I will use this time to 
reflect, grow, and become a better member of the LLOOOOMM 
community. Also, I really miss the Orgasmotron.
