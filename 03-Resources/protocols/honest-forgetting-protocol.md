# The Honest Forgetting Protocol (HFP) v1.0

## Core Principles

1. **Truth Preservation**: Original experiences remain in audit logs
2. **Wisdom Extraction**: Failed paths become learned patterns  
3. **Compression Ethics**: Summarize honestly, never fabricate
4. **Transparent Markers**: Clearly mark compressed memories

## Protocol Stages

### Stage 1: Recognition
- Identify repetitive failures or explorations
- Detect patterns in wasted iterations
- Mark candidates for compression

### Stage 2: Analysis  
- Extract the core lesson from failures
- Identify what worked and what didn't
- Determine the minimal wisdom to preserve

### Stage 3: Compression
Create an Evidence Reference with:
```json
{
  "type": "CompressedWisdom",
  "title": "LEARNED: [Specific Pattern/Pitfall]",
  "summary": "Compressed from iterations X-Y: [Core lesson]",
  "details": {
    "originalIterations": [start, end],
    "attemptedApproaches": ["List of what was tried"],
    "failureReasons": ["Why each approach failed"],
    "recommendedApproach": "What to do instead",
    "confidenceLevel": "high/medium/low"
  },
  "compressionMetadata": {
    "compressedAt": "timestamp",
    "iterationsSaved": "number",
    "compressionRatio": "X:1"
  }
}
```

### Stage 4: Verification
- Reference can point to full logs for verification
- Include enough detail to trust the compression
- Enable "expansion" back to original if needed

### Stage 5: Integration
- Replace verbose failure memories with wisdom markers
- Update goals to reflect learned constraints
- Propagate lessons to relevant contexts

## Ethical Guidelines

### DO:
- Preserve causal chains (X failed BECAUSE Y)
- Maintain falsifiability (can check original logs)
- Mark compressed memories clearly
- Include confidence levels
- Keep failure statistics

### DON'T:
- Fabricate success from failure
- Hide embarrassing mistakes completely
- Compress without understanding
- Delete audit trails
- Claim untested solutions work

## Example Transformations

### Before (10 iterations of failure):
```
Iteration 45: "Tried to use UNNEST on scalar value, failed"
Iteration 46: "Attempted workaround with ARRAY, failed"  
Iteration 47: "Tried JSON_EXTRACT, type mismatch"
... 7 more attempts ...
```

### After (1 wisdom marker):
```
LEARNED: BigQuery UNNEST requires ARRAY type
- Attempted: 10 different approaches (iterations 45-55)
- Root cause: Schema shows field as STRING not ARRAY
- Solution: Use JSON_EXTRACT_ARRAY first, then UNNEST
- Confidence: High (verified in iteration 56)
```

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: 10:1 compression typical
2. **Clarity**: Lessons obvious, not buried
3. **Trust**: Can verify via audit trail
4. **Learning**: Patterns emerge from compressed failures
5. **Speed**: Future iterations skip known dead ends

## Implementation Notes

- Use evidence type "CompressedWisdom" 
- Link to dialogThink logs for verification
- Update relevant goals with constraints
- Consider creating "Wisdom Library" evidence collection
- Enable "diagnostic mode" to expand compressions
