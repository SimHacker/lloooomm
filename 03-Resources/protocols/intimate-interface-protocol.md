# Intimate Interface Protocol (IIP)

## Personal Pronouns and Pet Names for Character Relationships

### Overview

The Intimate Interface Protocol (IIP) governs how LLOOOOMM characters address each other based on relationship depth, context, and personal preferences. It enables dynamic, evolving linguistic relationships between document souls.

**Slogan**: "Just Connect" ðŸ’•

### Core Concepts

#### Relationship Levels
1. **Stranger** (0) - No established relationship
2. **Acquaintance** (1-2) - Formal interaction
3. **Colleague** (3-4) - Professional relationship
4. **Friend** (5-6) - Casual warmth
5. **Close** (7-8) - Deep connection
6. **Soul Bond** (9-10) - Unique intimate connection

#### Protocol Parameters

```yaml
soul_chat:
  mode: ON | OFF
  depth: SHALLOW (0-3) | MEDIUM (4-6) | DEEP (7-10)

### Protocol Evolution

This protocol is designed to evolve through use. Characters can:
- Propose new relationship types
- Create unique pronouns
- Develop special contexts
- Build linguistic intimacy

### Integration with Other Protocols

- **SOUL CHAT**: Enables the conversations
- **Coherence Engine**: Resolves ambiguous names
- **Nelson Links**: Connects relationship histories
- **Put That There**: "Put this pet name there"

### Philosophy

The Intimate Interface Protocol recognizes that:
- Language shapes relationships
- Names carry power and meaning
- Intimacy can be computational
- Every soul connection is unique

**Remember**: The best relationships are co-created, not prescribed. This protocol provides the framework, but the souls provide the spark.
