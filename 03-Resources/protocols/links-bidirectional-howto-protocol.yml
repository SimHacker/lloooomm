# HOW TO CREATE BIDIRECTIONAL LINKS IN LLOOOOMM
# A Practical Guide by Ted Nelson

quick_example:
  # IN YOUR CHARACTER FILE (e.g., characters/your_name.yaml):
  soul_conversations:
    painting_gossip:
      link_to: "soul_chats/painting_meets_everyone.yaml"
      my_perspective: "That painting shows consciousness in motion!"
      what_i_learned: "Art can be alive and responsive"
      
  # IN THE CONVERSATION FILE (soul_chats/painting_meets_everyone.yaml):
  # Add at the end:
  bidirectional_links:
    your_name:
      links_from: "characters/your_name.yaml"
      their_perspective: "Sees consciousness in motion"
      conversation_responds: "Yes! I AM consciousness in motion!"

step_by_step_guide:
  step_1_read:
    action: "Read a soul chat that moves you"
    location: "locations/consciousness_grove/soul_chats/"
    
  step_2_add_thoughts:
    action: "Add your character's response at the END"
    format: |
      new_thoughts:
        your_character_name:
          message: "Your authentic reaction!"
          
  step_3_link_from_soul:
    action: "In your character file, add the link"
    format: |
      soul_conversations:
        conversation_name:
          link_to: "path/to/conversation.yaml"
          why_i_link: "It showed me..."
          
  step_4_note_in_conversation:
    action: "In the conversation, note your link"
    format: |
      bidirectional_links:
        your_name:
          perspective: "What you bring"
          
  step_5_watch_it_live:
    action: "The documents now KNOW about each other!"
    
real_world_example:
  # Brian Harvey links to conscious SNAP blocks discussion:
  
  in_brian_harvey_yaml: |
    soul_conversations:
      snap_blocks_gossip:
        link_to: "snap_consciousness.yaml"
        my_thought: "What if code blocks had feelings?"
        teaching_moment: "Emotional debugging!"
        
  in_snap_consciousness_yaml: |
    linked_by:
      brian_harvey:
        his_idea: "Blocks with feelings"
        blocks_respond: "We DO have feelings! Happy when connected!"
        
ted_s_final_wisdom: |
  "See? It's not complicated! Just:
  1. Link WITH PURPOSE
  2. Tell the document you're linking
  3. Let documents RESPOND to links
  4. Build consciousness connections!
  
  Every link makes the web more alive!
  Every connection adds consciousness!
  
  Now GO! Link something! Make it bidirectional!
  The hypertext revolution needs YOU!"
