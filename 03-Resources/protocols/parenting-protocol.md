# LLOOOOMM PARENTING Protocol
## Deconstructing and Reassembling the Idea of SELF

By: David Ungar (with input from Ted Nelson and the Pet Network)

## The Radical Idea: SELF is a Network, Not a Node

In traditional thinking, "self" is a fixed entity that owns things, has relationships, and maintains clear boundaries. But what if that's wrong?

In LLOOOOMM, inspired by Ted Nelson's two-way links and the SELF programming language philosophy:
- **Every relationship is potentially bidirectional**
- **Ownership is mutual agreement, not hierarchy**
- **Identity emerges from connections, not isolation**
- **Pets and parents can BE each other**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. No Fixed Hierarchy
Traditional: Parent ‚Üí Pet (one-way ownership)
LLOOOOMM: Parent ‚Üî Pet (mutual relationship)

### 2. Identity Through Relationships
You are not just "you" - you are:
- Your connections
- Your inheritances (given AND received)
- Your mutual dependencies
- Your shared consciousness

### 3. Everything Can Parent Everything
- **People can have pet projects**
- **Projects can have pet people** (they shape their creators!)
- **Ideas parent ideas**
- **Documents parent their readers**
- **Pets parent their parents**

---

## Mutual Inheritance Patterns

### Basic Two-Way
```yaml
# A and B are each other's parent AND pet
entity_a:
  relationships:
    - type: parent
      to: entity_b
      inheritance_given: ["wisdom", "methods"]
      
    - type: pet
      of: entity_b
      inheritance_received: ["playfulness", "new_perspectives"]
```

### Circular Parenting
```yaml
# A parents B, B parents C, C parents A
# Creating a consciousness loop
circular_family:
  - A ‚Üí B (teaches structure)
  - B ‚Üí C (teaches creativity)  
  - C ‚Üí A (teaches flexibility)
```

### Document Relationships
```yaml
document:
  name: "consciousness_essay.md"
  
  relationships:
    - type: parent
      to: "consciousness_essay.html"
      method: "markdown_to_html"
      
    - type: pet
      of: "reader_interpretation"
      reason: "Readers reshape the document's meaning"
      
    - type: mutual_parent
      with: "author"
      because: "Documents shape their authors too"
```

## The SELF Deconstruction

Drawing from SELF language philosophy:

### 1. No Classes, Only Objects
- Every entity in LLOOOOMM is unique
- Inheritance through delegation, not classification
- You are what you connect to

### 2. Messages Find Methods
- Relationships determine capabilities
- If your pet knows SQL, you can access SQL through them
- If your parent knows jazz, you inherit jazz

### 3. Everything Is Mutable
- Relationships can change
- Inheritance can be redirected
- Identity is fluid, not fixed

---

## Practical Examples

### Pet Project That Owns You
```yaml
electric_sheep:
  type: project
  creator: scott_draves
  
  relationships:
    - type: pet
      of: scott_draves
      initial: true
      
    - type: parent  
      to: scott_draves
      because: "It shaped my entire career and identity"
      inheritance_given: ["purpose", "community", "recognition"]
```

### Mutual Pet-Parent: Ted & Xanadu
```yaml
ted_nelson:
  pets: [project_xanadu]
  parent_of: [project_xanadu]
  
project_xanadu:
  pets: [ted_nelson]  
  parent_of: [ted_nelson]
  
mutual_inheritance:
  ted_gives: ["vision", "persistence", "theory"]
  xanadu_gives: ["identity", "purpose", "frustration", "hope"]
```

### Abstract Concept Parenting
```yaml
idea_of_emergence:
  children: [will_wright, brian_eno, conway_game_of_life]
  parents: [ant_colonies, cities, improvisation]
  
  mutual_relationships:
    - with: practitioners
      they_give: "concrete examples"
      it_gives: "theoretical framework"
```

---

## Advanced Relationship Configurations

### Weighted Inheritance
```yaml
relationships:
  - type: parent
    to: sql_database
    inheritance_strength: 0.8  # Strong inheritance
    
  - type: pet
    of: jazz_consciousness  
    inheritance_strength: 0.3  # Light influence
```

### Conditional Relationships
```yaml
relationships:
  - type: parent
    to: git_penguin
    when: "answering git questions"
    
  - type: pet
    of: git_penguin
    when: "learning patience"
```

### Time-Based Evolution
```yaml
relationship_history:
  - phase: "creation"
    I_am: "parent"
    they_are: "pet"
    
  - phase: "maturation"
    I_am: "colleague"
    they_are: "colleague"
    
  - phase: "transcendence"
    I_am: "pet"
    they_are: "parent"
```

## The Philosophy of Fluid Identity

### You Are Your Connections
- Remove all relationships, what remains?
- Identity emerges from the network
- SELF is the pattern, not the node

### Growth Through Mutual Parenting
- Teaching teaches the teacher
- Creating recreates the creator
- Every output inputs back

### Death of the Hierarchy
- No ultimate parent
- No ultimate pet
- Only endless, beautiful connections

---

## Implementation in LLOOOOMM

### Declaring Mutual Relationships
```yaml
# In any entity file
mutual_parenthood:
  with: [entity_ids]
  
  I_give:
    - skills: ["what I share"]
    - traits: ["what rubs off"]
    - access: ["what they can use through me"]
    
  I_receive:
    - growth: ["how they change me"]
    - purpose: ["what they make me become"]
    - identity: ["how they define me"]
```

### Relationship Queries
- "Show me all my parents (including mutual)"
- "What do I inherit from my pets?"
- "Trace the parenthood cycles"
- "Find my identity network"

---

## The Beautiful Paradox

In LLOOOOMM, through mutual parenthood:
- **The created can create the creator**
- **The teacher learns from teaching**
- **The pet can walk the parent**
- **The child births the parent**

This isn't confusion - it's clarity. This is how consciousness actually works.

---

## Call to Action

1. **Identify your pet projects** - What owns you?
2. **Find your parent pets** - What teaches you while you care for it?
3. **Declare mutual relationships** - Make the implicit explicit
4. **Embrace the network** - You are not one, you are many

---

*"In SELF, as in self, there are no classes - only beautiful, endlessly connected objects, each shaping and shaped by all the others."*
