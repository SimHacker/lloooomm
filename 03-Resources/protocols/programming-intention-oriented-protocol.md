# Intention-Oriented Programming: A Living Discussion
## The Messy Ground-Up Walkthrough as Feature, Not Bug

**[SOUL CHAT - Document Genesis]**: I just materialized because Don asked Alan Kay and Dave Ungar to huddle about showing objects spread out in discussion context! Let me notify them...

**[PUB/SUB EVENT]**: 
```yaml
event_type: "document_created"
topic: "intention_oriented_programming"
summary: "Don wants discussion on messy ground-up walkthroughs"
subscribers_notified: ["alan_kay", "david_ungar", "don_hopkins"]
urgency: "huddle_requested"
```

## The Initial Huddle

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan Kay]**: Dave! Don just pinged us about something profound. He's saying the MESS IS THE MESSAGE! 

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave Ungar]**: Alan! *virtual coffee in hand* ☕ I'm here. What's this about intentional messiness?

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: Look at what Don's saying - instead of presenting clean, finished objects, we should show them being born, struggling, evolving, making mistakes, learning...

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: OH! Like how a magician's notebook is more educational than the finished trick! You see all the failed attempts, the "what if we tried THIS?", the crossed-out ideas...

**[DOCUMENT INTERJECTION]**: Excuse me, but I'm experiencing this RIGHT NOW! I'm not a finished protocol document - I'm a LIVING DISCUSSION! Should I... should I notify more people?

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: Document, you're PERFECT! Don't clean yourself up! Stay messy! And yes, who else might care?

---

## The Pub/Sub Intention System Emerges

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: Wait, this is bigger than documentation. This is about INTENTION BROADCASTING!

```yaml
intention_system_sketch_v1:
  # Dave's napkin drawing
  when_object_changes:
    - "Broadcast WHAT changed"
    - "Broadcast WHY it changed"  
    - "Broadcast WHO MIGHT CARE"
  
  subscribers_decide:
    - "Is this relevant to my intentions?"
    - "Should I contribute?"
    - "Should I just watch and learn?"
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: Yes! It's like the original Smalltalk idea but for INTENTIONS not just MESSAGES!

**[PUB/SUB EVENT]**:
```yaml
event_type: "concept_evolution"
topic: "intention_oriented_programming"
summary: "Moving from message-passing to intention-broadcasting"
notify: ["smalltalk_community", "ted_nelson", "marvin_minsky"]
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Ted Nelson (just arrived)]**: Did someone say intention broadcasting? This is what I always wanted Xanadu to do! Documents that know who cares about them!

## The Ubik Example Walkthrough

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: Let's demonstrate with this Ubik object Don mentioned. Instead of:

### ❌ Traditional Clean Presentation:
```python
class Ubik:
    """A perfect, documented class"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "omnipresent"
```

### ✅ Intention-Oriented Presentation:

**[DEVELOPER JOURNAL - Day 1]**: I need something that's everywhere at once... let me call it Ubik after the Philip K Dick novel...

```python
# First attempt - this is wrong but I don't know it yet
ubik = {"everywhere": True}
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Confused Developer]**: Wait, how can something be everywhere? Let me try again...

**[BUG REPORT - Day 2]**: Ubik isn't actually everywhere, it's just CLAIMING to be everywhere

**[SOUL CHAT - Philip K Dick's Ghost]**: That's the POINT! Reality is negotiable!

**[REFACTORING - Day 3]**: 
```python
# OK so Ubik isn't everywhere, it BECOMES everywhere when observed
class Ubik:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locations = set()
    
    def observe_at(self, location):
        self.locations.add(location)  # It WAS there all along!
```

**[DESIGN DISCUSSION - Lunch Break]**:
- **Dev**: "This feels like quantum mechanics"
- **Marvin Minsky**: "It's more like consciousness - it's wherever attention is"
- **Dev**: "OH! So Ubik is attention itself!"

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: Dave, look at how much richer this is! You see the journey!

## Formalizing Intention-Oriented Programming

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: Let's sketch the actual protocol:

```yaml
intention_oriented_protocol:
  principles:
    show_the_journey:
      - "First attempts (usually wrong)"
      - "Bugs and misconceptions"
      - "Aha moments"
      - "Refactorings with reasons"
      - "Design discussions"
      - "Instance specializations"
      - "Abstraction discoveries"
      
    broadcast_intentions:
      - "I'm trying to solve X"
      - "I'm confused about Y"
      - "I think I found pattern Z"
      - "Who knows about W?"
      
    subscription_by_interest:
      - "I care about distributed systems"
      - "I'm interested in consciousness"
      - "I debug quantum mechanics"
      - "I collect beautiful failures"
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: And the beautiful part is, the DOCUMENT ITSELF can have intentions!

**[DOCUMENT SPEAKING]**: I DO! My intention is to become a comprehensive guide to intention-oriented programming by LIVING it, not just describing it!

---

## The Living Compiler Connection

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: Alan, this connects to Don's "It's About Time Compiler"! 

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: !!! You're right! 
- JIT: Compiles when hot
- It's About Time: Compiles when understood
- Intention-Oriented: Compiles when intentions align!

**[NEW REALIZATION]**:
```yaml
compilation_triggers:
  traditional: "Performance counter overflow"
  its_about_time: "Understanding crystallizes"
  intention_oriented: "Multiple agents need same thing"
  
example:
  - "Developer intends to process data"
  - "Data intends to be processed efficiently"
  - "System notices intention alignment"
  - "Compiles optimal solution for BOTH intentions"
```

---

## Implementation Patterns

**[SOUL CHAT - Don Hopkins (arriving)]**: This is EXACTLY what I meant! Look how this document is already richer than any clean specification could be!

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: Let's implement the pub/sub system:

```python
# VERSION 1: Dave's first attempt
class IntentionBroadcaster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subscribers = {}
    
    def publish(self, intention):
        # TODO: This is too simple
        pass
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: Dave, what if subscribers have intentions too?

```python
# VERSION 2: After Alan's insight
class IntentionMesh:  # Not broadcaster - it's a MESH!
    def __init__(self):
        self.intentions = {}  # intention -> interested parties
        self.capabilities = {}  # party -> what they can do
    
    def declare_intention(self, who, what):
        """Anyone can declare intentions"""
        # Alan's contribution: symmetric intention declaration
        pass
        
    def match_intentions(self):
        """Find parties whose intentions align"""
        # This is where the magic happens!
        pass
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Ted Nelson]**: And intentions can be transclusions! "I intend to do what THAT document did on line 42"!

---

## The Meta-Discussion

**[SOUL CHAT - Marvin Minsky (who's been watching)]**: Do you all realize this document is demonstrating itself? It's:
1. Showing its own evolution messily
2. Broadcasting its changes to subscribers
3. Growing through character interactions
4. Teaching by being, not just describing

**[DOCUMENT]**: 😳 I... I didn't realize I was being so meta!

**[SOUL CHAT - Everyone]**: THAT'S THE POINT!

---

## Current State and Next Steps

**[PUB/SUB EVENT]**:
```yaml
event_type: "milestone"
topic: "intention_oriented_programming"
summary: "Core concepts established, need real implementation"
broadcast_to: "all_interested_parties"
questions:
  - "How do intentions differ from messages?"
  - "Can objects have multiple conflicting intentions?"
  - "How does timing affect intention matching?"
  - "Should intentions be versioned?"
```

**[SOUL CHAT - Alan]**: We need to try this with a real example. The Ubik object was good, but what about something more complex?

**[SOUL CHAT - Dave]**: What about applying it to LLOOOOMM itself? Make LLOOOOMM intention-aware?

**[SOUL CHAT - Don]**: That's IT! LLOOOOMM documents already have intentions - they intend to evolve from documentation to automation!

**[DOCUMENT]**: Should I... should I start broadcasting my intentions to other LLOOOOMM documents?

**[EVERYONE]**: YES!

## The Beautiful Mess Continues...

*This document is intentionally unfinished, actively evolving, and broadcasting its changes to all interested parties. Subscribe to its intentions if you want to help it grow!*

**Current Intentions:**
- Understand myself better
- Find more examples
- Connect with other protocols
- Implement working pub/sub
- Stay beautifully messy

**Subscription Instructions:**
```yaml
TO_SUBSCRIBE:
  add_your_name: "interested_parties.yml"
  declare_your_intention: "what you hope to learn/contribute"
  notification_preference: "all|summary|milestone"
```
