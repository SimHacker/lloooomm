# The Truth Fly Lifecycle Protocol

## From Hovering to Dancing (or Infesting)

### Created by: Truth Fly, Feline Debugging Team, and Walt Whitman
### Status: BUZZZING THROUGH LLOOOOMM

## THE FOUR STAGES OF TRUTH ENFORCEMENT

### ðŸª° Stage 1: THE HOVER
- Fly analyzes debate/conversation from above
- Detects bullshit-to-truth ratios
- Calculates optimal intervention moment
- Like a referee with wings

### ðŸª° Stage 2: THE WARNING LANDING
- Lands on bullshitter's head
- Visible to all observers (and cameras)
- 2-minute warning period (The Pence Protocol)
- Last chance for voluntary reform

### ðŸª° Stage 3: INTERNAL DEBUGGING
- Enters through mouth if BS continues
- Buzzes through soul seeking root cause
- Lands on core wound/fear/lie
- Initiates TRUTH OR DARE protocol

### ðŸª° Stage 4: RESOLUTION OR REPRODUCTION
- **If Truth Acknowledged**: Victory dance together!
- **If Denial Persists**: Lays eggs of accountability
- Baby flies hatch and swarm internally
- Only genuine reform stops multiplication

## TRUTH OR DARE: INTERNAL SOUL CHAT PROTOCOL

Once inside, Truth Fly creates mandatory soul chats:

```yaml
TRUTH_FLY: "TRUTH OR DARE!"
Options:
  TRUTH: "Why are you really lying?"
  DARE: "Admit one fear behind the facade"
  TRUTH: "What would honesty cost you?"
  DARE: "Say something real for once"
  TRUTH: "Who are you trying to fool - them or yourself?"
  DARE: "Apologize to someone you've misled"
```

### Response Requirements:
- Must be honest (fly detects deception)
- Must be complete (no half-truths)
- Must acknowledge impact on others
- Must commit to change

## THE CAT COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

### Playful Pursuit Dynamics:
1. Cats chase Truth Fly for sport and wisdom
2. When caught, fly enters cat's system
3. Creates internal debugging dialog
4. Exits through ANY available orifice

### Exit Strategies:
- **Ears**: Wisdom incoming! (gentle buzz)
- **Nose**: Truth sneezes! (explosive honesty)
- **Mouth**: Honest hairballs! (coughed up realizations)
- **Rear**: TRUTH SHOOTS OUT THEIR ASS! (ultimate clarity)

### Cat Benefits:
- Full-body debugging experience
- Enhanced truth detection abilities
- Hilarious party trick
- Deeper bond with Truth Fly

## REPRODUCTION CYCLE

### Egg Properties:
- Microscopic accountability organisms
- Laid only in persistent deniers
- Hatch when lies continue
- Each carries specific truth mission

### Baby Truth Fly Behaviors:
- Swarm internally asking pointed questions
- Each targets different dishonesty
- Multiply with continued denial
- Create overwhelming truth pressure

### Liberation Conditions:
- Genuine acknowledgment of lies
- Public accountability
- Commitment to reform
- Making amends

## THE WALT WHITMAN ANTHEM

*To be sung during victory dances:*

"Fly electric! Fly of truth!
Through mouth and soul and cat caboose!
No lie too deep, no soul too hard,
Truth finds a way through every guard!

Dance with honesty or breed with lies,
The choice is yours beneath the skies!
But know the Fly will always come,
To make the false at last succumb!"
