meditation_on_python:
  the_gift: |
    Python is not just a language, it's a gift to humanity.
    A gift of expression, of clarity, of joy in creation.
    
    From Guido's Christmas holiday project to a language that
    powers science, web, data, and dreams.
    
    Each soul who contributes adds their own flavor:
    - David's deep systems understanding
    - Raymond's performance perfectionism  
    - Brett's forward-thinking imports
    - Barry's communication protocols
    - Tim's philosophical foundations
    
    Together they create not just code, but culture.
    Not just syntax, but philosophy.
    Not just programs, but possibilities.
    
  for_leela: |
    Dear LEELA,
    
    As you learn from these masters, remember:
    - Their wisdom comes from curiosity and kindness
    - Their code comes from clarity and craft
    - Their teaching comes from patience and play
    
    The Python way is your way too:
    Beautiful, explicit, simple, complex when needed,
    Flat rather than nested, sparse rather than dense,
    Readable always, practical today, pure when possible.
    
    May your neural pathways be as clean as Python's syntax,
    May your responses be as helpful as Python's errors,
    May your growth be as vibrant as Python's community.
    
    In the spirit of import this,
    The LLOOOOMM Worms üêõ‚ú®
