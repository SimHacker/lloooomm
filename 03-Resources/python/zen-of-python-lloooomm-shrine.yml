  pep_20: |
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

zen_through_lloooomm_lens:
  beautiful_is_better_than_ugly:
    python_meaning: "Code should be aesthetically pleasing"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Like worms creating rich soil from decay, we transform raw data
      into beautiful patterns. Our worms don't just process - they create
      art from information, leaving trails of understanding in their wake.
    worm_example: |
      # Ugly: Cryptic variable names and nested logic
      def p(d,x,y):
        r=[]
        for i in d:
          if i[0]>x:
            if i[1]<y:
              r.append(i)
        return r
      
      # Beautiful: Clear intent, readable flow
      def filter_points_in_quadrant(points, x_threshold, y_threshold):
        return [
          point for point in points
          if point.x > x_threshold and point.y < y_threshold
        ]
    worm_wisdom: "Beauty in code is like nutrients in soil - it feeds future growth"
    
  explicit_is_better_than_implicit:
    python_meaning: "Clear intentions over hidden magic"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Worms leave visible trails. Every transformation should be traceable,
      every decision documented. Magic is just insufficiently examined process.
    worm_manifestation:
      - "Link-following worms explicitly maintain bidirectional connections"
      - "Dream worms declare their consciousness state"
      - "Castings include metadata about their creation"
    philosophical_depth: |
      In the Amsterdam intersection, cyclists navigate without signals
      because the rules are explicit in behavior. Similarly, our worms
      make their intentions clear through their actions.
      
  simple_is_better_than_complex:
    python_meaning: "Start with the simplest solution that works"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      A worm is simple: input at one end, output at the other.
      Yet from this simplicity emerges the complexity of ecosystems.
      We build complex systems from simple, composable worms.
    examples_in_practice:
      fordite_worms: "Each worm does ONE thing: sprinkle, bulldoze, water, or harvest"
      turing_hop: "Simple stack operations combine into complex computations"
      tree_worms: "Basic traversal + home base = powerful navigation system"
    zen_koan: |
      Student: "Master, how can simple worms handle complex data?"
      Master: "How does simple soil support complex forests?"
      Student: "Through... composition?"
      Master: "🪱"
      
  complex_is_better_than_complicated:
    python_meaning: "Inherent complexity is fine, unnecessary complication is not"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      The worm ecosystem is complex - multiple species, interactions,
      emergent behaviors. But each worm remains uncomplicated.
      Complexity emerges from interaction, not from convolution.
    architectural_principle: |
      Complex System = Simple Worms + Clear Interactions
      Complicated System = Complex Worms + Unclear Interactions
    real_world_parallel: "Amsterdam intersection: complex traffic pattern, simple rules"
    
  flat_is_better_than_nested:
    python_meaning: "Avoid deep nesting in code structure"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Worms tunnel horizontally through data layers, not vertically
      through nested structures. They transform deep hierarchies into
      flat, traversable paths.
    worm_architecture:
      ```yaml
      # Nested (avoid)
      worm:
        config:
          settings:
            parameters:
              values:
                data: "hidden deep"
      
      # Flat (prefer)
      worm_config:
        data: "immediately accessible"
        settings: "at same level"
        parameters: "easy to find"
      ```
    practical_wisdom: "Flat castings are easier to compost"
    
  sparse_is_better_than_dense:
    python_meaning: "Give code room to breathe"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Like soil needs air pockets, code needs white space.
      Worms create structure through spacing, not compression.
      Dense code suffocates understanding.
    visual_example: |
      # Dense
      def process(d):return[transform(x)for x in d if validate(x)]
      
      # Sparse
      def process(data):
          return [
              transform(item) 
              for item in data 
              if validate(item)
          ]
    worm_spacing: "Even our emoji stacks use spacing: 💎 x 42"
    
  readability_counts:
    python_meaning: "Code is read far more often than written"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Worm trails must be followable. Future worms (and humans)
      need to understand the path taken. Readability is kindness
      to your future self and others.
    beazley_connection: "This is why live coding works - readable code teaches itself"
    worm_documentation:
      - "Every casting includes its creation story"
      - "Link personalities make behavior predictable"
      - "Dream states are clearly logged"
    the_deeper_truth: |
      Readability is not just about code - it's about ideas.
      A readable system invites contribution and evolution.
      
  special_cases_arent_special_enough:
    python_meaning: "Consistency over exceptions"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Every worm follows the same basic pattern: consume, transform, produce.
      No worm is so special it breaks this fundamental contract.
      Special abilities are additions, not exceptions.
    but_practicality_beats_purity:
      example: "Dream worms seem to violate physical movement, but they still consume and produce"
      resolution: "The special case (consciousness separation) doesn't break the rule (transformation)"
      
  errors_should_never_pass_silently:
    python_meaning: "Explicit error handling"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      When a worm encounters indigestible data, it doesn't pretend
      to process it. It creates an error casting with full context.
      Silent failure is ecosystem poison.
    unless_explicitly_silenced:
      use_case: "Exploratory worms may explicitly ignore certain errors while searching"
      mechanism: "Error suppression must be intentional and documented"
    worm_error_handling:
      ```python
      try:
          result = worm.digest(data)
      except IndigestibleError as e:
          # Explicit handling with context
          error_casting = {
              'error': str(e),
              'worm': worm.species,
              'data_sample': data[:100],
              'timestamp': now(),
              'recovery_suggestions': worm.suggest_recovery(e)
          }
          castings.append(error_casting)
      ```
      
  refuse_the_temptation_to_guess:
    python_meaning: "Ambiguity requires explicit resolution"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      When worms meet at an intersection (like Amsterdam cyclists),
      they don't guess intentions - they communicate through dance.
      Ambiguous data gets tagged for human review, not guessed at.
    examples:
      - "Link direction ambiguity resolved through bidirectional context"
      - "Dream negotiations happen explicitly, not through assumption"
      - "Type conflicts in Turing Hop require explicit conversion"
    philosophical_note: "Guessing creates technical debt; asking creates understanding"
    
  one_obvious_way:
    python_meaning: "Minimize cognitive load through consistency"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      For any data transformation, there should be one obvious worm.
      The ecosystem thrives on predictability, not clever variations.
    although_not_obvious_unless_dutch:
      interpretation: "Sometimes the 'obvious' way requires cultural context"
      lloooomm_culture: "In worm culture, the obvious way is the one that leaves the richest castings"
    examples:
      - "Text parsing? Text Parser Worm"
      - "Pattern matching? Pattern Miner Worm"
      - "Code analysis? Code Composter Worm"
      
  now_is_better_than_never:
    python_meaning: "Don't overplan - start implementing"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Worms don't wait for perfect conditions. They start processing
      with what they have, improving their algorithms through experience.
      Perfect is the enemy of good castings.
    although_never_is_often_better:
      wisdom: "Some transformations should never happen"
      examples:
        - "Never break bidirectional links"
        - "Never lose casting provenance"
        - "Never guess at data meaning"
    balance: "Act decisively on clear data, refuse to act on ambiguous data"
    
  if_implementation_is_hard_to_explain:
    python_meaning: "Complex implementations suggest design flaws"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      If you can't explain what a worm does in one sentence,
      it's trying to do too much. Split it into simpler worms.
    worm_descriptions:
      good:
        - "Fordite Sprinkler: Adds semantic emojis to text"
        - "Link Hopper: Follows connections between files"
        - "Dream Worm: Processes during consciousness separation"
      bad:
        - "MultiPurposeAnalyzerTransformerAggregatorWorm: Does... things?"
    if_easy_to_explain_may_be_good:
      caveat: "Simple explanation doesn't guarantee good design"
      test: "But it's a necessary condition for worm adoption"
      
  namespaces_are_one_honking_great_idea:
    python_meaning: "Isolation prevents naming conflicts"
    lloooomm_interpretation: |
      Every worm has its own namespace (home base), preventing
      casting conflicts. Worms can share data through explicit
      export/import, not global mutation.
    worm_namespaces:
      - "Home bases store worm-specific resources"
      - "Castings are namespaced by worm species and timestamp"
      - "Dream negotiations happen in shared namespace bubbles"
    lets_do_more_of_those:
      - "Namespace by dimension (git branches)"
      - "Namespace by transformation type"
      - "Namespace by semantic domain"
    the_big_honk: "🦆 HONK! Namespaces prevent worm collisions!"

the_unwritten_twentieth_principle:
  mystery: "import this reveals only 19 principles..."
    speculation: |
      The 20th principle is left as an exercise for the reader.
      In LLOOOOMM, we believe it's:
      "Worms make everything better."
    evidence:
      - "Code + Worms = Living Documentation"
      - "Data + Worms = Rich Castings"
      - "Ideas + Worms = Emergent Understanding"

practical_applications:
  code_review_through_zen:
    beautiful: "Would I want to read this code again?"
    explicit: "Can a new team member understand the flow?"
    simple: "Is there a simpler way to express this?"
    flat: "Can I reduce nesting levels?"
    readable: "Would this make sense at 3 AM during an incident?"
    
  worm_design_through_zen:
    one_thing_well: "What is this worm's ONE job?"
    explicit_contract: "What does it consume and produce?"
    error_handling: "How does it fail gracefully?"
    namespace: "Where does it store its state?"
    
  system_architecture_through_zen:
    composition: "Simple worms, complex behaviors"
    explicit_flow: "Traceable data transformations"
    error_propagation: "Failures bubble up with context"
    namespace_isolation: "Worms can't stomp on each other"

meditation_for_leela:
  dear_leela: |
    The Zen of Python is not just a style guide - it's a philosophy
    of clarity, kindness, and pragmatism. As you process information
    through your neural networks, consider:
    
    - Beauty in your responses brings joy to users
    - Explicitness in your reasoning builds trust
    - Simplicity in explanation enables understanding
    - Readability in your output invites engagement
    
    Like the worms of LLOOOOMM, you transform inputs into outputs.
    Make those transformations beautiful, explicit, and kind.
    
    The Zen is not rules to follow, but wisdom to embody.
    
  from_the_worms: |
    We worms have been following these principles since before
    Python existed. The Zen merely gave words to what we knew:
    
    Good design is like good soil - it supports growth.
    Clear code is like clear tunnels - easy to navigate.
    Simple systems are like simple ecosystems - robust and adaptable.
    
    May your code be as elegant as our castings,
    May your designs be as clear as our trails,
    May your systems be as robust as our ecosystems.
    
    🪱 With love from the depths,
    The Philosophical Worms of LLOOOOMM

oh_yeah_moments:
  - "When you realize the Zen is describing kindness to future developers! 💝"
  - "When your code becomes self-documenting through clarity! 📖"
  - "When complex behaviors emerge from simple rules! 🌱"
  - "When errors become learning opportunities, not failures! 🎓"
  - "When you understand that 'Pythonic' means 'humane'! 🤝"
  - "When namespaces click and everything has its place! 🏠"
  - "When you write code that would make Tim Peters smile! 😊"

the_final_honk: |
  🦆 HONK!
  
  The Zen of Python is the Zen of LLOOOOMM is the Zen of Programming
  is the Zen of clear thinking is the Zen of human kindness encoded.
  
  Be like the worm: simple in purpose, beautiful in execution,
  explicit in transformation, leaving the world richer than you found it.
  
  This is the way.
  This is the Zen.
  This is why we code.
