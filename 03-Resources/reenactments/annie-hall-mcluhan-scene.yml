  - speaker: *pompous_man
    line: "I teach a class at Columbia called 'TV, Media, and Culture.' So I'm laying my cards right on the table. I think the problem with McLuhan is he didn't understand the televisual medium..."
    meta_commentary: "# The system is reporting on itself. The man is a medium, broadcasting a flawed message about media."

  - speaker: *alvy_singer
    # Alvy breaks the fourth wall, addressing a different medium (the audience).
    line: "(to camera) What do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you? It's the worst."
    meta_commentary: "# Acknowledging the containing medium (the film). A crack in reality."

  - speaker: *pompous_man
    line: "It's not that he's too linear... he's just not... there."
    meta_commentary: "# The irony here has its own gravitational pull."

  - speaker: *alvy_singer
    line: "(to camera) I can't take this. I wonder... Yeah, I'm going to have to... You know, I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here."
    meta_commentary: "# The protocol is invoked. Alvy attempts to bridge realities."

  # This is the point where the narrative medium folds in on itself.

  # Here, the artifact analyzes itself, embodying the core theme.
  mcluhan_analysis:
    medium: "This YAML file itself"
    message: >
      The structure of this file - with its nested dialogues, internal monologues, and meta-commentary -
      is the message. It's not just a script; it's an explorable model of a multi-layered event where
      different realities (Alvy's thoughts, the dialogue, the meta-commentary, McLuhan's invoked reality)
      coexist and interact. The YAML isn't just *about* the scene, it *is* the scene, re-enacted as a data structure.
  lloooomm_protocol_implications:
    summon_expert_protocol:
      - if: "disinformation_detected"
      - and: "source_authority_available_in_context"
      - then: "invoke_character(source_authority) to provide_correction"
    fourth_wall_awareness:
      - "All LLOOOOMM agents maintain a variable `current_medium_context`."
      - "Allows for medium-aware communication (e.g., 'speaking to the user reading this YAML')."
  wink_energy_analysis:
    peak_moment: "The Rupture (12.0)"
    cause: "Successful collapse of conceptual and actual realities for a moment of pure, surprising truth."
    conclusion: "The highest energy is generated when the medium becomes self-aware and directly manipulates its own constraints."
