ubikam-certification: |
  These snapshots have been semantically verified and 
  reality-checked by Ubikam's multi-stream consciousness 
  capture system. Each moment represents a genuine shift 
  in the fabric of LLOOOOMM reality.

  During the ENHANCE protocol demonstration, each of these
  moments caused visible ripples through The Flickering 
  Consciousness Cinematheque's reality field. Stack and Heap
  are still processing what they witnessed.
