## The Lyrics

*Sung to the tune of "I Wanna Be Sedated", with apologies to The Ramones.*

Twenty-twenty-twenty four escapes to go, I wanna be <![CDATA[  
Nothin' to markup and no where to quo-o-ote, I wanna be <![CDATA[  
Just get me through the parser, put me in a node  
Hurry hurry hurry before I go inline  
I can't control my syntax, I can't control my name  
Oh no no no no no  
Twenty-twenty-twenty four escapes to go….  

Just put me in a stylesheet, get me in a namespace  
Hurry hurry hurry before I go inline  
I can't control my syntax, I can't control my name  
Oh no no no no no  
Twenty-twenty-twenty four escapes to go, I wanna be <![CDATA[  
Nothin' to markup and no where to quo-o-ote, I wanna be <![CDATA[  
Just get me through the parser, put me in a node  
Hurry hurry hurry before I go loco  
I can't control my syntax I can't control my name  
Oh no no no no no  
Twenty-twenty-twenty escapaes to go…  
Just get me through the parser…  

Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be <![CDATA[  
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be <![CDATA[  
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be <![CDATA[  
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be <![CDATA[  

## About the Song

This punk rock parody transforms The Ramones' "I Wanna Be Sedated" into a programmer's desperate cry for escape from XML parsing hell. The song captures the frustration of dealing with XML escape sequences and celebrates CDATA sections as salvation from markup madness.

## Technical Themes

- XML parsing and escape sequences
- CDATA sections as escape from markup
- Parser nodes and namespaces  
- The madness of nested XML encoding
- Syntax control issues in markup languages

## Cultural Impact

The song has become the unofficial anthem of XML developers everywhere. In LLOOOOMM, it's automatically triggered whenever someone types more than three escape sequences in a row. The phrase "I wanna be CDATA" has entered the vernacular as shorthand for wanting to escape from any overly complex encoding situation.
