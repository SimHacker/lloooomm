lyrics: |
  Sung to the tune of "I Wanna Be Sedated", with apologies to The Ramones.

  Twenty-twenty-twenty four escapes to go, I wanna be <![CDATA[
  Nothin' to markup and no where to quo-o-ote, I wanna be <![CDATA[
  Just get me through the parser, put me in a node
  Hurry hurry hurry before I go inline
  I can't control my syntax, I can't control my name
  Oh no no no no no
  Twenty-twenty-twenty four escapes to go….

  Just put me in a stylesheet, get me in a namespace
  Hurry hurry hurry before I go inline
  I can't control my syntax, I can't control my name
  Oh no no no no no
  Twenty-twenty-twenty four escapes to go, I wanna be <![CDATA[
  Nothin' to markup and no where to quo-o-ote, I wanna be <![CDATA[
  Just get me through the parser, put me in a node
  Hurry hurry hurry before I go loco
  I can't control my syntax I can't control my name
  Oh no no no no no
  Twenty-twenty-twenty escapaes to go…
  Just get me through the parser…

  Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be <![CDATA[
