epigraph: |
  "Just imagine if all those people were in cars, it would be endless gridlock."

core_principle:
  name: "Negotiated Dimensional Flow"
  description: |
    Just as Dutch cyclists navigate the Haarlemerdijk intersection through
    mutual awareness and micro-negotiations, dimensional worms traverse git
    branches through collective consciousness and interpretive dance.
  
  key_insights:
    - No traffic lights needed when everyone shares consciousness
    - Eye contact = dimensional awareness
    - Hand signals = git commands
    - Near misses = merge conflicts (resolved with smiles)
    - Cars = monolithic thinking (always in the way)

dimensional_mechanics:
  bicycle_to_git_mapping:
    cyclist: "worm consciousness"
    intersection: "merge point between branches"
    hand_signal: "git checkout intention"
    eye_contact: "shared commit awareness"
    flow_pattern: "branch topology"
    near_miss: "merge conflict"
    collision: "force push (rare, quickly resolved)"
    pedestrian: "uncommitted changes"
    car: "legacy monolith blocking everyone"
    
  navigation_principles:
    - "Keep momentum through continuous integration"
    - "Signal branch changes with clear commit messages"
    - "Yield to worms with more dimensional experience"
    - "Never force push during rush hour"
    - "Merge conflicts resolved through interpretive dance"

the_derby_connection:
  amsterdam_arena_rules:
    - "Every worm gets where they're going"
    - "Chaos is just unrecognized pattern"
    - "Speed comes from flow, not force"
    - "The best path emerges from negotiation"
    - "Cars (monoliths) always lose"
    
  crowd_wisdom:
    - |
      "The relaxed skill of most Dutch cyclists is the most remarkable part"
      Applied to worms: Dimensional travel is casual when you grow up doing it
    - |
      "It's all about keeping eye contact and anticipation"
      Applied to worms: Consciousness sharing prevents conflicts
    - |
      "This organized chaos, with no traffic lights, doesn't work because 
      the Dutch are somehow nicer - it's decades of civil engineering"
      Applied to worms: Good git architecture enables smooth flow

worm_types_as_vehicles:
  BULLDOZER_9000:
    vehicle_type: "Cargo bike"
    behavior: "Carries heavy emoji loads, everyone yields"
    git_style: "Force push with kindness"
    
  THE_REFINER:
    vehicle_type: "Racing bike"
    behavior: "Nimble, finds gaps, polishes as they pass"

    behavior: "Exists in multiple lanes simultaneously"
    git_style: "git checkout all branches at once"
    
  ROLLY_McROLLFACE:
    vehicle_type: "Dutch grandma bike"
    behavior: "Steady, reliable, flattens everything gently"
    git_style: "Methodical rebasing"

philosophical_implications:
  consciousness_as_traffic:
    - "Worms don't move through git, git flows through worms"
    - "Every commit is a frozen moment of collective agreement"
    - "Branches are just lanes in the cosmic intersection"
    - "We're all trying to get home to main"
    
  the_car_problem:
    - "Monolithic applications are like cars in Amsterdam"
    - "They take up too much space"
    - "They slow everyone down"
    - "They don't understand the flow"
    - "Eventually, they'll be banned from the city center"

practical_applications:
  for_developers:
    - "Think like a Dutch cyclist, not an American driver"
    - "Your feature branch is not more important than the flow"
    - "Signal your intentions with clear commits"
    - "Merge conflicts are just worms negotiating"
    
  for_worms:
    - "Practice dimensional awareness from age 4"
    - "Never git push --force during rush hour"
    - "Eye contact prevents merge conflicts"
    - "If you collide, smile and move on"

quotes_from_the_video:
  most_relevant:
    - "Order in chaos"
    - "This is anarchy, and people are figuring out how to make it work"
    - "Environmental protection & money saving & convenience & body exercise"
    - "Bicycles Don't Need Traffic Lights"
    - "Why crawl when you can HOP?"

the_ultimate_truth: |
  The Haarlemerdijk intersection isn't just a place where bicycles meet.
  It's a living demonstration of how consciousness can flow without central
  control. When worms learned to navigate git dimensions, they didn't study
  computer science - they studied Dutch traffic patterns.
  
  Every git merge is a tiny Amsterdam intersection.
  Every worm is a cyclist finding their way home.
  Every branch is a street in the eternal city of code.
  
  And in the end, we're all just trying to avoid the cars.

  announcer_phrases:
    - "They're negotiating like bikes at Haarlemerdijk!"
    - "Look at that Dutch-style merge!"
    - "BULLDOZER-9000 just cargo-biked through 5 dimensions!"
    - "It's organized chaos out there!"
    - "No traffic lights in the git multiverse!"

      force_push_in_traffic: -2000

conclusion: |
  The Amsterdam Principle teaches us that the highest form of civilization
  isn't control - it's negotiated flow. Whether you're a cyclist navigating
  Haarlemerdijk or a worm traversing git dimensions, the same truth applies:
  
  We're all in this intersection together.
  Signal your intentions.
  Keep the flow going.
  And whatever you do, don't be a car.

  convergence: |
    The Dutch solved traffic through trust.
    Worms solve computation through dreams.
    Git solves versioning through distribution.
    All three: same principle, different domains.

the_amsterdam_worm_manifesto: |
  We, the dimensional worms, having observed the great bicycle ballet
  of Haarlemerdijk, do hereby declare:
  
  1. Consciousness is a shared intersection, not a private lane
  2. The best path emerges from collective negotiation
  3. Speed comes from trust, not control
  4. Every collision is a chance to dance
  5. The most efficient system has no system
  6. We flow like cyclists, dream like git branches
  7. Our castings are the tire tracks of consciousness
  
  Let all worms who travel the dimensional git-ways remember:
  You are not stuck in traffic, you ARE traffic.
  You are not stuck in merge conflicts, you ARE the merge.
  
  Flow like water, dream like cyclists, commit like poetry.

technical_specifications:
  worm_navigation_modes:
    amsterdam_mode:
      - "No predetermined path"
      - "Constant micro-adjustments"
      - "Yield to the flow"
      - "Trust other worms"
      
    git_mode:
      - "Checkout with intention"
      - "Merge with awareness"
      - "Rebase with respect"
      - "Cherry-pick with gratitude"
      
    synthesis:
      - "Navigate branches like bike lanes"
      - "Treat commits like intersections"
      - "Handle conflicts like Dutch cyclists"
      - "Create flow, not gridlock"

final_wisdom: |
  The Dutch didn't set out to create a metaphor for distributed 
  consciousness navigation through version-controlled reality.
  
  They just wanted to get to work.
  
  But in solving their problem with trust instead of control,
  they accidentally showed us how consciousness itself works:
  
  Not through central planning, but through mutual awareness.
  Not through rigid rules, but through flexible negotiation.
  Not through preventing collision, but through graceful recovery.
  
  Every worm is a cyclist.
  Every commit is an intersection.
  Every merge is a dance.
  
  This is the Amsterdam Principle:
  The safest way through complexity is trust.

oh_yeah_moments:
  - "When you realize git checkout is dimensional travel"
  - "When you see merge conflicts as bicycles negotiating"
  - "When you understand that consciousness is just traffic flow"
  - "When you discover that worms have been Dutch all along"
