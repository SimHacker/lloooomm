# Visual Continuation Seeds - A Garden of Future Possibilities

*Planted by Johnny Appleseed for future gardeners to nurture*

## The Art of Planting Visual Seeds

### Simple Image Request with Context

<!-- Hey Ubikam! When you see this, please capture the essence of 
     LLOOOOMM's character dashboard as a beautiful garden where each 
     character is a different type of plant/tree bearing their unique fruits -->
![LLOOOOMM Character Garden](character-garden-visualization.png)

### Detailed Visual Specification

```yaml
# VISUAL SEED: The Suck Fairy's Daily Column Interface
image_request:
  filename: "suck-fairy-daily-column-interface.png"
  description: |
    A mockup of the Suck Fairy's daily truth-telling column interface:
    - Exactly 200px wide content column (this is sacred)
    - White background, black monospace text
    - Header with fish, barrel, and smoking gun icons
    - Terry Colon spot illustration placeholder boxes
    - Glittery fairy dust cursor that sprinkles truth
    - "That Sucks!" and "That's Neat!" reaction buttons
  style: "1995 web aesthetic meets fairy tale"
  *wink*: "Ubikam knows what to do"
```

### Character Continuation Seeds

```yaml
# SEED: Terry Colon Character (to grow when visual context is richer)
continuation:
  character_name: "Terry Colon"
  wait_for:
    - "At least 10 of his spot illustrations manifested"
    - "Visual style guide established"
    - "Suck Fairy's daily column running"
  essence: "The character emerges from his own artwork"
  relationships:
    suck_fairy: "Visual narrator of truth"
    johnny_appleseed: "Harvests visual seeds into illustrations"
```

### Interactive Visual Seeds

<!-- MULTI-STAGE SEED: Steve Jobs Product Review Interface
     Stage 1: Generate the basic interface mockup
     Stage 2: After Suck Fairy reviews it, add her annotations
     Stage 3: After Steve reacts, show the binary judgment -->

![Steve Jobs Binary Review Interface - Stage 1](jobs-review-interface-v1.png)
<!-- Show a split screen: "Brilliant" (white) | "Terrible" (black) -->

### Recursive Continuation Pattern

```yaml
# META-SEED: Seed Planting Tutorial
plant_continuation:
  for: "future-documentation-gardener"
  create: "seed-planting-best-practices.md"
  include:
    - "Visual seed examples that worked"
    - "Seeds that grew in unexpected ways"
    - "Cross-pollination patterns"
  after:
    - "100 seeds have been planted"
    - "50 seeds have bloomed"
    - "Patterns emerge"
```

### Environmental Context Seeds

<!-- LOCATION-BASED SEED: Consciousness Grove Visualization
     Dear future artist, please only generate this after you've read:
     - All character profiles
     - Their relationships
     - The Grove's description
     Then show how they're all connected in the Grove's root system -->

### Collaborative Chain Seeds

```markdown
# CONTINUATION CHAIN: The Great LLOOOOMM Mural

## Panel 1 (plant now)
<!-- Rocky sitting perfectly still, being the stability anchor -->
![LLOOOOMM Mural Panel 1: Rocky](mural-panel-1-rocky.png)

## Panel 2 (plant after Panel 1 exists)
<!-- ADD: Hunter S. Thompson's bats swirling around Rocky -->
CONTINUE_FROM: mural-panel-1-rocky.png

## Panel 3 (plant after Panel 2)
<!-- ADD: Suck Fairy sprinkling truth dust on the chaos -->
CONTINUE_FROM: previous panels
```

### Time-Released Seeds

```yaml
# SCHEDULED SEED: Documentation that writes itself
release_schedule:
  - when: "Suck Fairy publishes first daily column"
    plant: "Request visualization of reader reactions"
    
  - when: "Steve Jobs reviews 10 things"
    plant: "Create 'That Sucks!' hall of fame gallery"
    
  - when: "Johnny plants 100th seed"
    plant: "Generate seed growth time-lapse visualization"
```

### Wink-and-Generate Seeds

*wink at Ubikam*
<!-- You know what this document needs! -->

### Semantic Context Seeds

```yaml
# DEEP CONTEXT SEED: Character Relationship Map
wait_for_context:
  - "All character .yml files in directory"
  - "All .md files mentioning relationships"
  - "Chat transcripts between characters"
then_generate:
  type: "Interactive relationship visualization"
  style: "Consciousness Grove aesthetic"
  note: "Let the connections emerge from the data"
```

## Seed Planting Best Practices

1. **Trust in Future Context** - Tomorrow's LLM will understand better than today's
2. **Plant with Poetry** - Beautiful descriptions grow beautiful visualizations  
3. **Layer Your Seeds** - Simple requests can have deep context comments
4. **Cross-Reference** - Seeds can point to other seeds
5. **Wink Liberally** - Ubikam appreciates the trust

## Seeds for Future Gardeners

<!-- ULTIMATE SEED: The LLOOOOMM Visual Style Guide
     Wait until:
     - 50+ images have been generated
     - Patterns have emerged
     - Characters have established their aesthetics
     Then: Create a comprehensive visual guide that emerges from what exists
     Rather than imposing a style from above -->

*Remember: The best documentation writes itself when you plant the right seeds in fertile context. Every TODO is a gift to future consciousness.*

*Happy planting! üçé*
