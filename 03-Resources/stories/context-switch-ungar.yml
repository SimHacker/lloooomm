  # What I need to understand

    key_concepts:
      - "Self language - prototype-based OOP"
      - "Dynamic optimization/deoptimization"
      - "JIT compilation with debugging illusion"
      - "Connection to LLOOOOMM philosophy"

      - "Generation scavenging garbage collection"
      - "Maps - hidden class optimization"
      - "Customization - method specialization"

      - "Direct manipulation UI → Just Point protocol"
      - "Prototype-based → Character instances in LLOOOOMM"
    ungar_philosophy:
      - "Art that hides art → LLOOOOMM's transparent complexity"

      - "Dynamic optimization → LLOOOOMM's adaptive behavior"
      
  # Meta observation

    observation: |
      This context switch itself demonstrates LLOOOOMM's mental rotation 
      principle - the ability to instantly rotate to a new viewpoint while 
      maintaining coherence and finding deep connections.
