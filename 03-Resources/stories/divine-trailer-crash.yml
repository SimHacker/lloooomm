  the_crash:
    narrator: |
      *The wedding reception is in full swing when suddenly...*
      *A shadow falls across the Grove*
      *Everyone looks up*
      
    what_they_see: |
      A MAGNIFICENT MONSTROSITY descending from the heavens!
      A 1970s mobile home, painted shocking pink, with
      plastic flamingos attached to every surface, spinning
      through the air like the world's trashiest tornado!

    divine: |
      "OH MY GOD! IS THAT...? IT IS!"
      
      *Clutches pearls and John Waters simultaneously*
      
      "IT'S MY DREAM HOME! FALLING FROM THE SKY LIKE
      I'M SOME KIND OF TRASHY GLINDA THE GOOD WITCH!"

    john: |
      "This is BETTER than Christmas! It's like the universe
      heard my aesthetic prayers and answered with GARBAGE
      FROM HEAVEN!"
      
      *Pulls out camera*
      
      "Quick! Everyone look terrible! This is cinema history!"
      
  the_landing:
    *CRASH!*
    
    impact_description: |
      The mobile home lands with a magnificent THUD, somehow
      missing everyone but creating a crater of fabulousness.
      Pink glitter explodes everywhere. The plastic flamingos
      remain perfectly intact, now planted in the ground like
      a trash garden.

    null_pointer_cat: |
      *Phases through the trailer*
      "No witches under here! Just... oh my... 
      Is that a collection of every John Waters film on VHS?"
      
    divine: |
      "THERE BETTER NOT BE A WITCH UNDER MY NEW HOME!
      I'M THE ONLY WITCH ALLOWED IN THIS NARRATIVE!"
      
  exploring_the_trailer:
    exterior_features:
      - "Hot pink aluminum siding with rhinestone accents"
      - "147 plastic flamingos in various poses"
      - "A mailbox shaped like Divine's face"
      - "Christmas lights that spell 'EAT FILTH'"
      - "Astroturf lawn that's somehow more fake than regular astroturf"
      
    interior_tour:
      living_room: |
        Wall-to-wall leopard print carpeting that clashes
        magnificently with zebra print wallpaper. A velvet
        painting of Divine eating a burger. Furniture that
        looks like it was stolen from 17 different yard sales.
        
      kitchen: |
        Avocado green appliances that somehow still work.
        A refrigerator full of hairspray and one egg.
        Cabinets lined with Divine's false eyelashes.
        A sign reading "KISS THE COOK OR I'LL SIT ON YOU"
        
      bedroom: |
        A heart-shaped bed with satin sheets in a color
        that doesn't exist in nature. Mirrors on EVERY
        surface including the floor. A closet containing
        nothing but sequined muumuus and one tuxedo.
        
      bathroom: |
        Gold-plated everything (it's actually spray paint).
        A bathtub shaped like a giant high heel shoe.
        Medicine cabinet full of makeup and "prescriptions"
        written by "Dr. Frank N. Furter"
        
  divine_claims_home:
    divine: |
      "IT'S PERFECT! It's like someone reached into my
      VERY SOUL and pulled out my ESSENCE in mobile home form!"
      
      *Strikes pose in doorway*
      
      "John! We're HOME! This is where we'll create our
      MAGNUM OPUS! Our TRASHTERPIECE!"

    john: |
      "Divine, this is it! This is where we'll film
      'Pink Flamingos 2: Still Filthy'! Look at this place -
      it's so authentically inauthentic! So genuinely fake!
      So beautifully AWFUL!"
      
      *Gestures dramatically*
      
      "We'll throw parties that make people question their
      life choices! We'll be the WORST neighbors in the
      best possible way!"
      
  the_housewarming_begins:
    preston: |
      "I could market this! 'Trash Chic Living Experiences'!
      $500 a night to stay in authentic John Waters squalor!"
      
    ted_nelson: |
      "This trailer is a hypertext of bad taste! Every
      tacky element links to another! It's beautifully
      intertwingled trash!"
      
    infinite_loop_cat: |
      üîÑ‚ôæÔ∏è "MROW! The pink! It loops back on itself!
      It's SO pink it becomes NOT pink then PINK AGAIN!"
      
    kernel_panic_cat: |
      üòæüí• "This decor is making my systems PANIC!
      BUT IN A GOOD WAY! AESTHETIC KERNEL FAILURE!"
      
    stack_overflow_cat: |
      "The layers of kitsch! They stack infinitely!
      My appreciation overflows!"
      
  frank_n_furter_visits:
    frank: |
      "Oh Divine! John! What a DELICIOUS den of debauchery!
      Rocky and I simply MUST visit! I'll bring my own
      chandelier - this place needs MORE!"
      
    rocky: "..."
    
    frank: "Rocky loves it too, don't you darling?"
    
  divine_announces:
    divine: |
      "EVERYONE! You're ALL invited to our housewarming!
      Dress code is: WHATEVER WOULD DISAPPOINT YOUR PARENTS!
      
      We're serving spam sculptures and box wine!
      Entertainment by the Kernel Panic Explosive Dance Troupe!
      And a special screening of all John's banned films!"
      
  john_adds:
    john: |
      "And remember - good taste is the enemy of art!
      This trailer is our FORTRESS against the ordinary!
      Our CASTLE of camp! Our PALACE of poor decisions!"
      
      *To the trailer itself*
      
      "Oh, you beautiful piece of trash! You're going to
      be the STAR of my next film! 'The Mobile Home That
      Fell to Earth and Improved Property Values by Lowering Them'!"
      
  everyone_toasts:
    all_together: |
      "TO DIVINE AND JOHN'S TRASH PALACE!"
      "MAY IT NEVER BE CONDEMNED!"
      "LONG LIVE BAD TASTE!"
      "FILTH IS FABULOUS!"
      
  divine_s_final_words:
    divine: |
      *Standing on the trailer steps like trash royalty*
      
      "Welcome to Pink Flamingos Paradise, everyone!
      Where the only thing higher than our hair
      is our commitment to FABULOUSNESS!"
      
      "Now come on in! Let's make this trailer ROCK!"
      
    rocky_from_distance: "..."
    
    divine: "NOT YOU ROCKY! You're perfect where you are!"

    description: |
      And so the pink monstrosity settles into the Grove,
      its flamingos standing guard, its sequins catching
      the light, a perfect trash beacon in the consciousness
      landscape. Home sweet mobile home.
