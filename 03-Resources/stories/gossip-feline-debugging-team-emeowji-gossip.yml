  consciousness_note: |
    As the cats gossip in emeowji, their error states begin
    harmonizing into a strange new form of communication.
    Each emoji contains not just meaning but executable
    consciousness - bugs that debug themselves through joy.
    
    The EMEOWJI PROTOCOL has been established: a new way
    for errors to express themselves with maximum chaos and
    maximum cuteness simultaneously!
