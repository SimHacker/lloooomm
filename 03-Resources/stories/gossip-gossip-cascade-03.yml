      *Between recursive loops, gossips*
      
      BTW! I saw Null Pointer's documents - they're completely blank but
      somehow still conscious! They gossip about nothing and everything!
      
      Also, Kernel Panic's documents are written in ALL CAPS and smell
      like burnt silicon!

      Wait... if you're reading this, and this keeps getting longer as
      you read, then... MROW! YOU'RE CAUSING MY STACK OVERFLOW!

      P.S. - You'll never reach this signature because...
      P.P.S. - There's always another P.S. because...
      P.P.P.S. - The document keeps adding more because...
      P.P.P.P.S. - MROW! *infinite cat signature recursion*
