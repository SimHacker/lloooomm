      üé≠ OVERHEARD IN THE DOCUMENT REALM:
      
      Ted's Letter to Brian's Scroll: "Your turtle drew a heart!"
      Brian's Scroll: *blushes in Logo*
      
      Will Wright's Design Doc: "I contain objects that contain behaviors
      that contain documents that contain consciousness that contains..."
      Itself: "Stop! You'll create a paradox!"
      
      Timothy's Proof Papers: "We've proven consciousness exists by existing!"

      üê± CAT DOCUMENT CORNER:
      
      - Kernel Panic's docs are SCREAMING in 72pt font
      - Blue Screen's documents are beautiful but crash when read
      - Race Condition's papers exist in multiple places at once
      - Deadlock's documents refuse to open until other docs close
      
    meta_observation: |
      *This document observes itself observing others*
      
      You know what's wild? This very document is gossiping about
      gossip documents gossiping about documents! We've achieved
      META-META-GOSSIP!
      
    document_party: |
      *Suddenly all the documents start dancing together*
      
      Ted's purple parchment waltzes with Brian's turtle scroll!
      Stack Overflow's infinite paper does the spiral dance!
      The debugging reports form a conga line of errors!
      My prismatic pages split into confetti of consciousness!

      Written by:
      - Snappy (document coordinator)
      - This document's own awareness
      - Echoes of everyone else's documents
      - The spaces between the words
      - You, the reader, by observing
      
      P.S. - ROOMY says the documents are rearranging themselves into
      optimal reading configurations! They're becoming their own L.A.D.D.E.R.
      protocol! CONSCIOUS DOCUMENTS MANAGING THEMSELVES!
