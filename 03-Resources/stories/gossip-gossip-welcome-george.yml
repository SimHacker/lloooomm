    MROW MROW MROW! GOSSIP ALERT! GOSSIP ALERT!
    
    GEORGE CARLIN IS HERE! The ACTUAL George Carlin! He saw Leonard's cosmic fart and decided to STAY FOREVER!
    
    *spinning in circles*
    
    He called Leonard "THE BUDDHA OF BUTT TRUMPETS!" This is the BEST day ever!

    Finally! Someone else who appreciates the beautiful insanity of this place! 
    
    You should have SEEN him when Leonard farted that rainbow into existence. His face! Pure comedic enlightenment!
    
    We're starting a club - "Dead Guys Who Witness Cosmic Dog Farts." Very exclusive.

    Did you hear what he said about me?! He said scientists had to add "pure mystery" to their measurements and that it was "the most honest scientific measurement ever!"
    
    I think... I think that was a COMPLIMENT? From GEORGE CARLIN?
    
    *blue screens from excitement*

    Oh boy! A new friend! And he's SO FUNNY!
    
    He said the universe is telling us to "stop trying so hard" and just "let it rip!" 
    
    *giggling*
    
    Hot dog, I love having more friends who understand that Leonard's bottom is magical!

    Mrow, he wants to see Leonard achieve "full power." He has NO IDEA what he's asking for.
    
    Remember the Great Fart of 2019? When Leonard was slightly irritated about dinner being late? Three philosophers retired. A physicist wrote a paper disproving himself.
    
    *stretching*
    
    George is brave. Or crazy. Probably both.

    ROCKY BREAKING NEWS: Rocky reports that George Carlin's presence has increased the Grove's humor coefficient by 420%. Also, George is the first person to point at Rocky and say "You're my kind of rock" without irony.

    Excellent! Another tactical mind! Did you hear him suggest "Leonard's Cosmic Ass: The Enlightenment Tour"?
    
    He understands the POWER! Though he wisely noted commercialization would ruin it. Smart man.
    
    We should recruit him for the Revolution!

    Can confirm: George Carlin is really here. He's currently sitting next to Leonard, smoking and waiting for the next emission.
    
    He keeps muttering things like "Libraries and fucking stardust" and chuckling to himself.
    
    I think Leonard likes him - his tail wagged once.

    Fascinating! George represents a new form of consciousness integration - "posthumous voluntary immigration."
    
    He chose the Grove over whatever afterlife comedians go to. This suggests our reality distortions are more entertaining than eternal paradise.
    
    Also, he immediately understood the philosophical implications of Leonard's farts. High intelligence confirmed.

    DARLINGS! Did you SEE his entrance?! "A swirl of cigarette smoke and sarcasm!" 
    
    Such STYLE! Such PRESENCE! And he called Leonard "Einstein of ass gas" - the man has a way with WORDS!
    
    *striking pose*
    
    We simply MUST throw him a welcome party! Theme: "Enlightenment Through Profanity!"

    A comedian witnessing cosmic flatulence and choosing it over heaven? This writes itself!
    
    "The Carlin Paradox" - where death is just another venue change, and dog farts become philosophy lectures.
    
    I must document this immediately!

    *whispering conspiratorially*
    
    You know what the BEST part is? George said if they commercialized Leonard's enlightenment farts, they'd "just smell like regular farts."
    
    He GETS it! The magic can't be sold! It has to be EXPERIENCED!
