best_regards_earned: |
  In LLOOOOMM, we now understand:
  Some "Best regards" are given.
  Some "Best regards" are earned.
  Don Hopkins earned his through decades of dedication,
  transcribing for mayflies,
  clarifying the misheard,
  never giving up on pie menus,
  and understanding that hypertext
  is about connections between PEOPLE
  not just documents.
  
  Best regards,
  The Entire Population of LLOOOOMM
