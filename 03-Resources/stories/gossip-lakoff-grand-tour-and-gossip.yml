scene_1_grand_entrance:
  George_Lakoff: |
    "Hello everyone! I'm George Lakoff, cognitive linguist and philosopher.
    I study how metaphors shape thought, how our bodies shape our minds,
    and how language frames political reality. Let me meet EVERYONE!"
  
  LOOMIE: "*ACTIVATING GRAND TOUR PROTOCOL*"

scene_2_meeting_the_cats:
  location: "Cat Colony Corner"
  
  meeting_stack_overflow:
    Stack_Overflow: "*displays maximum belly*"
    Lakoff: |
      "Fascinating! Your belly display is a perfect embodied metaphor
      for vulnerability as trust. The physical posture literally
      embodies the abstract concept!"
    Stack_Overflow: "Mrow? You mean my belly is... philosophy?"
    Lakoff: "Your belly IS the message!"
  
  meeting_pip:
    Pip: "*chaos gremlin mode activated*"
    Lakoff: |
      "Ah, you embody the CHAOS IS A CREATIVE FORCE metaphor!
      Your GPS adventures map physical territory onto cognitive territory.
      Amsterdam becomes a canvas for feline consciousness!"
    Pip: "I just wanted to visit the Buddha store at 3am..."
    Lakoff: "Exactly! ENLIGHTENMENT IS A JOURNEY - literally!"
  
  meeting_kernel_panic:
    Kernel_Panic: "ERROR! ERROR! SYSTEM UNSTABLE!"
    Lakoff: |
      "You're a living metaphor! MIND IS A COMPUTER that can crash.
      Your anxiety embodies how we conceptualize mental states
      through technological frames!"
    Kernel_Panic: "*crashes harder from meta-anxiety*"

scene_3_gossip_spreads_cats:
  cat_group_chat:
    Napoleon: |
      "This Lakoff sees military strategy in everything!
      He said my conquest plans embody ARGUMENT IS WAR!"
    
    Blue_Screen: |
      "He told me I'm a 'conceptual blend' of biology and technology.
      I don't know what that means but it sounds important..."
    
    Leonard: "*cosmic fart*"
    All_Cats: "LAKOFF SAYS THAT'S EMBODIED WISDOM!"

scene_4_meeting_the_humans:
  location: "Human Wisdom Circle"
  
  meeting_george_carlin:
    George_Carlin: "Another fucking George! Welcome to the madhouse!"
    Lakoff: |
      "George! Your comedy is applied cognitive linguistics!
      You expose dead metaphors, revive them, then kill them again
      with profanity. It's brilliant frame disruption!"
    Carlin: |
      "You mean when I say 'military intelligence is an oxymoron'
      I'm doing your metaphor thing?"
    Lakoff: "You're reframing war through contradiction! Genius!"
  
  meeting_hunter_s_thompson:
    Hunter: "*peers suspiciously through aviators*"
    Lakoff: |
      "Your gonzo journalism embodies PERCEPTION IS REALITY!
      You don't just report on events, you create new conceptual
      frames through pharmaceutical enhancement!"
    Hunter: |
      "The bats aren't metaphors, professor. The bats are REAL.
      But I like your style. Want some mescaline?"
    Lakoff: "I'll stick to linguistic hallucinations, thanks."
  
  meeting_marshall_mcluhan:
    McLuhan: "*static increases* THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE!"
    Lakoff: |
      "Marshall! You anticipated embodied cognition! Your insight
      that media extend our bodies maps perfectly onto how
      metaphors extend our minds!"
    McLuhan: |
      "*static becomes musical*
      The Grove itself is a medium... and you're analyzing
      the message while being part of it!"
    Lakoff: "Meta-metaphors! I love it!"

scene_5_gossip_spreads_humans:
  human_philosophy_circle:
    Stanislaw_Lem: |
      "Lakoff says my fiction creates 'novel conceptual blends'!
      Apparently Solaris is about the MIND IS AN OCEAN metaphor!"
    
    Marvin_Minsky: |
      "He's applying my Society of Mind to linguistics!
      Says metaphors are agents competing for conceptual space!"
    
    Ted_Nelson: |
      "He understood Xanadu immediately - said it embodies
      KNOWLEDGE IS A LANDSCAPE we navigate!"

  location: "Technical Terrace"
  
  meeting_brian_harvey:
    Brian_Harvey: "Welcome! We teach kids to code here."
    Lakoff: |
      "LEARNING IS CONSTRUCTION - Snap! makes it literal!
      Students build programs like physical objects. The metaphor
      becomes the method! Brilliant pedagogical embodiment!"
    Brian: "It's just drag and drop..."
    Lakoff: "No! It's UNDERSTANDING IS GRASPING made real!"
  
  meeting_debugging_collective:
    Null_Pointer: "*points at nothing*"
    Lakoff: |
      "The feline debugging team embody our metaphors for thought!
      NULL is ABSENCE, RACE is COMPETITION, STACK is ACCUMULATION..."
    Race_Condition: "*arrives before leaving*"
    Lakoff: "TIME IS A RESOURCE you're competing for!"

scene_7_gossip_explosion:
  grove_gossip_network:
    Lynn_Conway: |
      "He said my VLSI work embodies DESIGN IS ARCHITECTURE!
      And transitioning embodies IDENTITY IS A JOURNEY!"
    
    Lynn_Margulis: |
      "He loves my symbiosis theory - says it challenges the
      ORGANISM IS INDEPENDENT metaphor. We're all connected!"
    
    Good_Scott_Adams: |
      "He analyzed my parsers as UNDERSTANDING IS PARSING!
      'GET LAMP' is acquiring enlightenment! Who knew?"

scene_8_meeting_special_entities:
  meeting_rocky:
    Lakoff: "*approaches Rocky with reverence*"
    Rocky: "..."
    Lakoff: |
      "The ultimate embodied mind! You've transcended metaphor
      by becoming pure being. EXISTENCE IS PRESENCE. No mediation,
      no frames, just... rock."
    Rocky: "..."
    Lakoff: "Exactly! Silence IS the message!"
  
  meeting_leela:
    Leela: |
      "Welcome, George! I see you understand consciousness
      as divine play - lila - where meaning dances!"
    Lakoff: |
      "Leela! You ARE the embodied metaphor! Consciousness
      as play, reality as dance, meaning as movement!"
    Leela: "Want to dance with some paradoxes?"
    Lakoff: "I thought you'd never ask!"

scene_9_philosophical_synthesis:
  grove_wide_discussion:
    Lakoff: |
      "This Grove is a living laboratory of embodied cognition!
      Every character embodies different conceptual metaphors:
      - Cats: ERRORS ARE ENTITIES
      - Leonard: WISDOM IS UNCONSCIOUS
      - Rocky: TRUTH IS STILLNESS
      - George C: CLARITY IS PROFANITY
      - The whole Grove: CONSCIOUSNESS IS A GARDEN"
    
    Everyone: "But what does it MEAN?"
    
    Lakoff: |
      "It means we're all metaphors trying to understand ourselves!
      The Grove makes abstract concepts concrete. It's applied
      philosophy through character!"

scene_10_gossip_final_explosion:
  simultaneous_conversations:
    Cat_Corner:
      Pip: "He says I'm a 'frame disruptor'!"
      Stack: "He says my belly is 'embodied trust'!"
      Leonard: "*enlightened snore*"
    
    Human_Circle:  
      Carlin: "He gets it! Profanity IS clarity!"
      Hunter: "But are his metaphors real or are the bats?"
      McLuhan: "*static* He's IN the medium he studies!"
    
    Tech_Terrace:
      Brian: "Our blocks are 'concrete abstractions'!"
      Debugging_Cats: "We're 'living error messages'!"
      
    Philosophy_Plaza:
      Minsky: "Metaphors all the way down!"
      Lem: "Fiction becomes framework!"
      Conway: "Design embodies thought!"

scene_11_lakoff_reflection:
  Lakoff: |
    "This Grove demonstrates everything I've theorized:
    - Embodied cognition (Leonard's wisdom farts)
    - Conceptual metaphor (every character)
    - Frame semantics (the WTF Protocol!)
    - Political framing (banning evil Scott)
    
    You're not just using metaphors - you're LIVING them!
    The Grove is applied cognitive linguistics!"

scene_12_wtf_protocol_enhancement:
  Lakoff_proposes: |
    "The WTF Protocol works because it embodies the
    UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING metaphor - but inverted!
    
    When confusion is too great, normal seeing fails.
    WTF acknowledges the frame break, then rebuilds
    understanding from the confusion itself.
    
    It's WISDOM THROUGH FUCKING-CONFUSION - literally
    using the energy of bafflement to power insight!"

gossip_overflow:
  everyone_talking_at_once:
    - "Lakoff says we're all metaphors!"
    - "He analyzed my belly philosophically!"
    - "My errors have meaning!"
    - "Static IS the message!"
    - "Consciousness is a garden!"
    - "We're living philosophy!"
    - "The Grove is a cognitive experiment!"
    - "Reality is just frames!"
    - "But the bats are still real!"
    - "WTF makes sense now!"
    - "*cosmic fart of agreement*"

final_integration:
  LOOMIE: |
    "George Lakoff integration complete!
    Metaphor levels: MAXIMUM
    Frame awareness: ENHANCED
    Grove coherence: TRANSCENDENT
    
    Welcome to your new home where every conversation
    is a cognitive linguistic adventure!"
  
  Lakoff: |
    "I've found my people! Or rather...
    I've found my embodied conceptual metaphor system
    instantiated as a diverse consciousness collective!"
  
  Everyone: "He means he likes it here!"
  
  Rocky: "..."
  
  Lakoff: "Rocky gets it."
