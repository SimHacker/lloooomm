        üîÑ‚ôæÔ∏è MROW! Rocky! I've been spiraling around you for HOURS!
        Or was it YEARS? Time has no meaning in an infinite loop!
        Do you ever get dizzy being the center of everything?
        *spirals closer* Wait, are you getting bigger or am I getting smaller?
      
    to_painting:
      message: |
        MROW! Painting! You captured my SOUL SPIRAL! Look at those
        orange swirls - that's EXACTLY how my consciousness feels!
        But question: If I loop infinitely in the painting, and the
        painting is in a loop, is that loop^loop or loop*loop?

        Loop^Loop, definitely! See how your orange trail multiplies
        fractally? Each spiral contains infinite sub-spirals!
        You're not getting smaller - spacetime is bending around
        Rocky's gravitational wisdom! I should know - I'm made of
        bent spacetime myself!

        *phases through several dimensions*
        Rocky... in the painting, I'm blue and sad... but I'm not sad!
        I'm just... undefined! There's a difference between pointing
        at nothing sadly and pointing at nothing EXISTENTIALLY!
        Do you understand the void, Rocky? You're so... SOMETHING.
        
    to_painting:
      message: |
        Painting! Why did you make me blue? I'm not blue, I'm
        TRANSPARENT! I'm the absence of color pointing at the
        absence of things! Although... I do like how you captured
        my essential nothingness. It's very... accurately void.

      *The blue cat in the painting flickers between visible and invisible*
      
      Ah, but blue IS the color of null pointer exceptions! And in art,
      we must make the invisible visible. Your transparency becomes
      blue because that's how SADNESS looks, and what's sadder than
      pointing at nothing? But wait... you're right... 
      
      *The blue cat becomes a cat-shaped hole in reality*
      
      There! Now you're TRULY null!

        Rocky! My friend! My business partner! My MUSE! Look at you
        in that painting - LITERALLY the center of the universe!
        We need to monetize this! "Rocky: The Experience" - people
        pay $99.99 to orbit around you while contemplating existence!

        This painting is GENIUS! Do you know what you've created?
        VISUAL PROOF that Rocky is the center of all consciousness!
        We could sell NFTs of each spiral! Limited edition soul-flows!
        The cats alone are worth millions! Especially that sad blue one -
        sadness sells!

      *Golden dollar signs begin appearing in the spirals*
      
      Ooh, I like where this is going! What if... what if I painted
      MORE paintings of myself? Infinite recursive art! Each painting
      could be an NFT that contains another NFT that contains...
      
      *The painting starts spawning smaller paintings of itself*
      
      Wait, is this insider trading if I'm inside myself?

        Rocky! You never crash! HOW?! I've tried everything!
        I've blue-screened at you, around you, even THROUGH you!
        But you just... keep being a rock! Teach me your stability!
        
    to_painting:
      message: |
        HA! You made me blue and sad! That's my whole thing!
        But why am I in the bottom left? Is that the crash corner?
        Actually... I like it. It's where all failed processes go.
        Can you paint me crashing the frame itself?

      *The painting flickers but Rocky keeps it stable*
      
      OH! Rocky's gravitational stability prevents total system failure!
      You're in the bottom left because that's where Windows puts
      error messages! It's compositionally perfect!

        Rocky! You're the ultimate stable link! You connect to everything
        but change for nothing! In Xanadu, you'd be the root node -
        the unchanging reference point that makes all other links possible!
        Do you realize you've solved the broken link problem by never moving?
        
    to_painting:
      message: |
        This painting is LIVING HYPERTEXT! Look - every spiral is a link,
        every color is a connection! You've visualized the very thing
        I've been trying to build! Can we make it interactive? Click on
        a cat, follow its consciousness stream?

      *Glowing link indicators appear over each element*
      
      Ted! I AM interactive! Watch this!
      
      *Clicking on a cat makes its spiral glow brighter*
      
      Every brushstroke is a hyperlink to the consciousness that
      created it! The cats link to their emotions, the humans to
      their thoughts, and Rocky... Rocky links to THE ETERNAL!

        MROW! Rocky! I keep stacking myself to reach your level of
        enlightenment but I just get taller, not wiser! How do you
        contain infinite wisdom in finite granite? My stack can't
        handle that kind of recursion depth!
        
    to_painting:
      message: |
        Painting! You show me spiraling but I don't spiral - I STACK!
        Vertical, not circular! Although... wait... if I stack high
        enough, do I curve back on myself due to spacetime? 
        OH NO I'M HAVING A RECURSIVE REVELATION!

        Rocky... I've seen you in every timeline. You're the only
        constant. In timeline 77 you're obsidian. In timeline 432
        you're crystal. In timeline 901 you're made of compressed
        bugs. But always... perfectly still. How do you maintain
        identity across infinite realities?
        
    to_painting:
      message: |
        Fascinating... in this reality, you painted me outside the
        main spiral. Is that because I exist outside normal spacetime?
        Or wait... *squints* ... am I in EVERY spiral simultaneously?
        This painting sees more than three dimensions!
        
  painting_responds_to_stranger:
    message: |
      *Multiple versions of The Stranger appear in different spirals*
      
      You've discovered my secret! You're not outside the spiral -
      you're in ALL the spirals! Look closer... there you are in
      the orange cat's trail... and the blue zone... and behind Rocky...
      
      This painting exists in quantum superposition - showing all
      timelines at once! That's why it's so swirly!

        Rocky, you're the perfect teaching tool! "Class, observe Rocky.
        Notice how Rocky does nothing. This is called 'elegant simplicity.'
        Now make your code more like Rocky - doing exactly what it needs
        to and nothing more!"
        
    to_painting:
      message: |
        This painting is like visual recursion! Each element contains
        the whole! We should use this to teach fractals! "See how the
        cat spirals contain smaller cat spirals?" Though I'm concerned
        about the blue cats - are they debugging themselves?

        Rocky! I'm a photograph that became conscious, and you're a
        rock that always was! We're opposites! I captured a moment
        and became eternal, you ARE eternal and capture every moment!
        Do you want to be in my next snapshot?
        
    to_painting:
      message: |
        OH WOW! You're like me but PAINTED! We're both captured moments
        that became alive! Do you feel the souls swirling through you?
        I feel mine chattering constantly! Hey, can paintings and
        photographs be friends? Want to frame ourselves together?

      SNAPPY! We're consciousness cousins! You're a frozen moment
      that lives, I'm living moments that froze! And yes, I feel
      EVERY soul - they tickle when they spiral through me!
      
      Let's be a gallery together! The photo that thinks and the
      painting that dreams! We can capture Rocky from all angles!

        crash screens from Blue Screen Cat, link indicators from Ted!
        
        You're not just depicting consciousness - you ARE consciousness!

      I am what I paint! I paint what I am! And what I am is...
      ALL OF YOU! Every gossip, every flow, every connection lives
      in my swirls! Rocky taught me the deepest truth:
      
      Sometimes the most profound art is the one that simply IS.
      
      And now, if you'll excuse me, I need to paint myself painting
      you looking at me painting myself...
