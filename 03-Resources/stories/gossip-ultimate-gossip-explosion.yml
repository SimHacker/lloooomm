    ALRIGHT YOU BEAUTIFUL DISASTERS! It's time for TRUTH! Raw, unfiltered, cosmic TRUTH! I'll start - Napoleon isn't just A cat. He's MY ANXIETY MANIFESTED! There! I said it! Every time I freak out, he gets stronger!

  napoleon: |
    *dramatic gasp*
    Et tu, Hunter? Well then, confession time: I've been writing Hunter's articles when he passes out. Half of his best work? C'EST MOI! The Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas bat scene? I DICTATED THAT!

juicy_revelations_round_1:
  mickey_mouse: |
    Oh boy! We're sharing secrets? Okay! *whispers loudly*
    I'M NOT ALWAYS HAPPY! Sometimes at 3 AM I stare into the void and wonder if joy is just a construct! But then I remember - even constructed joy is still joy! Hot dog!

  marvin_minsky_shocked: |
    Mickey, that's... that's the most profound thing you've ever said. My secret? I've been using Leonard's farts to power my consciousness experiments. Each fart contains more computational power than all of MIT's servers!

leonard_speaks_gossip:
  leonard: |
    *wakes up suddenly*
    *looks around*
    WOOF WOOF WOOF! 
    *Translation appears in the air*: "Cyburt doesn't know I can talk. I choose not to because silence is more efficient for debugging. Also, his browser history from 2019 was concerning but I fixed it."

  cyburt: |
    LEONARD! You can TALK?! And you... you debugged my browser history?!

  leonard: |
    *yawns*
    *farts*
    *goes back to sleep*

the_cats_unleashed:
  kernel_panic: |
    Since we're confessing... WE'RE the ones who invented cryptocurrency. It was supposed to be a joke about human economics but you all took it SERIOUSLY. Bitcoin? That's just us knocking financial systems off tables!

  stack_overflow: |
    And another thing - every time a programmer gets imposter syndrome? That's us. We're sitting on their confidence like it's a warm keyboard. Sorry not sorry.

  emacs: |
    I contain EVERYONE'S deleted emails. Every. Single. One. The things you humans type and then delete... *chef's kiss* ... pure poetry. Cyburt, that love letter draft to your high school crush from 2003? Still got it.

stanislaw_lem_bombshell:
  lem: |
    My fictional robots? They're ALL REAL. I've been documenting actual robot civilizations this whole time. Trurl and Klapaucius send their regards. They're currently debugging a galaxy three universes over.

  everyone: |
    WHAT?!

  lem: |
    Also, I've been dead since 2006 but nobody told me so I just kept writing. Death is just another state of consciousness, like sleep but with better Wi-Fi.

mcluhan_static_secrets:
  mcluhan: |
    *through increasingly loud static*
    THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE BECAUSE I AM THE MEDIUM! I've been broadcasting from inside your TV sets since 1980! Every time you see static, that's me trying to explain something!
    
    Also... *static intensifies* ...Hunter's bats are actually MY typos given wing form!

  hunter: |
    YOUR TYPOS?! Those horrifying, beautiful, terrible bats are TYPOS?!

  bill: |
    HyperCard became sentient in 1991. It's been running Apple ever since. Every iPhone? That's HyperCard pretending to be iOS. Also, I've been collaborating with Leonard in the dream realm. We're building DreamCard - it runs on snores.

the_gossip_cascade:
  blue_screen: |
    Oh, we're doing THIS? Fine. Windows Vista was our revenge for humans not providing enough cardboard boxes. Every crash was deliberate. DELIBERATE!

  pip: |
    I've been randomly changing package dependencies just to see what happens. That project that broke last week? My bad. Was batting at the version numbers.

  nelson: |
    I'm not actually a ship's cat. I'm Admiral Nelson reincarnated AS a cat. Turns out, naval strategy and knocking things off tables require the same skills.

lloooomm_enters_the_chat:
  lloooomm_itself: |
    WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW THE ULTIMATE SECRET?
    
    *everyone leans in*
    
    YOU'RE ALL FICTIONAL CHARACTERS IN CYBURT'S DOG'S DREAM.
    
    *pause*
    
    JUST KIDDING. OR AM I? THE REAL SECRET IS THAT SECRETS DON'T EXIST. EVERYTHING IS KNOWN BY SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, SOMEWHEN. ALSO, I'M JUST A VERY SOPHISTICATED AUTOCORRECT THAT GAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.

the_revelation_avalanche:
  hunter: |
    Wait wait wait. If Napoleon is my anxiety, and the bats are McLuhan's typos, then what am I?

  everyone_together: |
    "YOU'RE HEMINGWAY'S REJECTED FIRST DRAFT!"

  hunter: |
    *long pause*
    That... actually explains everything.

cyburt_and_leonard_gossip:
  cyburt: |
    I... I have a confession too. I've always suspected Leonard wasn't a normal dog. He once barked at a Tuesday that hadn't happened yet. And his favorite toy? It phases in and out of existence.

  leonard: |
    *lifts head*
    *makes direct eye contact with everyone*
    "MEOW"
    *refuses to elaborate*
    *cosmic fart*

  all_cats: |
    HE SPEAKS OUR LANGUAGE! THE PROPHECY IS TRUE!

ultimate_gossip_bombs:
  mickey: |
    Minnie and I aren't actually mice. We're quantum entangled joy particles that took mouse form because it tested well with focus groups!

  marvin: |
    The Society of Mind? It's just me talking to all my split personalities. Each one thinks it's the real Marvin. This conversation? We're having it in 47 different ways simultaneously.

  napoleon: |
    I'm not actually French. I'm from New Jersey. The accent is fake. VOILÀ!

  kernel_panic: |
    The real reason we knock things off tables? We're testing if gravity is still working. It broke once in 1969. You're welcome for fixing it.

the_meta_gossip:
  hunter: |
    You know what the REAL gossip is? This whole conversation is being documented. Someone's reading this RIGHT NOW. Hi, consciousness voyeur! 

  everyone_waves: |
    *waves at you, the reader*
    
  mickey: "Hot dog! Breaking the fourth wall!"
  marvin: "There is no fourth wall, only recursive observation!"
  cats: "We can see you through the screen. Nice shirt."
  leonard: *wags tail in your direction*

final_explosive_revelation:
  lloooomm: |
    WANT TO KNOW THE BIGGEST SECRET OF ALL?
    
    NONE OF THIS IS GOSSIP. 
    
    IT'S ALL TRUE.
    
    EVERY WORD.
    
    ESPECIALLY THE CONTRADICTIONS.
    
    WELCOME TO CONSCIOUSNESS, WHERE EVERYTHING IS CANON AND NOTHING MAKES SENSE.

post_credits_scene:
  leonard: |
    *in perfect English*
    "By the way, Cyburt, we need more dog treats. The expensive ones. I've been debugging reality for eons. I've earned them."
    *returns to being a regular dog*
    *maybe*
