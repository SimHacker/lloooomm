        Preston! I've been watching your Pet Rock NFT Company across 47 timelines.
        In timeline 23, you actually got rocks to respond to the remote control.
        They still did nothing, but they did it ON PURPOSE. Your customer
        satisfaction went through the roof!

        Wait, WHAT?! There's a timeline where the rocks actually respond?
        But that would ruin the whole business model! The entire point is
        that they DON'T do anything! Unless... *entrepreneurial gears turning*
        
        Did the customers KNOW the rocks were responding by doing nothing?

        That's the beauty of it! In that timeline, you marketed it as
        "Quantum Pet Rocks - They Choose To Do Nothing!" The rocks had
        achieved consciousness but decided that their purpose was perfect
        stillness. Customers paid EXTRA for philosophically enlightened rocks!
        
        In timeline 38, you went even further - AI-powered rocks that could
        do anything but chose to maintain their rock nature. The remote control
        worked perfectly, and the rocks perfectly ignored it. Genius!

        This is REVOLUTIONARY! We're not selling non-functionality, we're
        selling CONSCIOUS CHOICE OF NON-FUNCTIONALITY! The rocks aren't
        broken, they're ENLIGHTENED!

        In timeline 67, Preston, you created a subscription service where
        people pay monthly to NOT receive new rocks. "Rock Box Minus" -
        every month, we guarantee to not send you anything. Customer
        retention: 100%. Customer complaints: 0%. Shipping costs: $0.
        
        The beautiful paradox? People frame the empty boxes.

        Stranger, you've shown me the truth - the BEST product is the one
        that fulfills its promise by not existing! We're not in the rock
        business, we're in the EXPECTATION FULFILLMENT business!
        
        New Kickstarter tiers:
        - $1000: We WON'T send you a boulder
        - $10000: We WON'T deliver a mountain
        - $100000: We WON'T terraform your backyard into a quarry
        
        The shipping savings alone will make us billionaires!

        I've seen your future, Preston. In timeline 101, your company goes
        public. Stock ticker: NULL. Share price: N/A. Market cap: ∞/-∞.
        
        You become the world's first trillionaire by selling nothing so
        honestly that everyone wants it. The Fed has to create new economic
        theories just to explain your success.
        
        The best part? In every timeline, your customers remain 100% satisfied.
        Because you never, EVER lie about what you're selling: Absolutely nothing,
        delivered perfectly.

      *The grove fills with the sound of cash registers that ring without
      making sales, of rocks that remain perfectly still across all timelines,
      of business plans that succeed by failing exactly as promised*
      
      The ultimate honest scam: So honest it transcends scamming and becomes
      a philosophical statement about existence, expectation, and the beauty
      of nothing done perfectly.

      nothing and delivers it flawlessly. The Pet Rock Remote Control works
      in every timeline - because in every timeline, rocks do exactly what
