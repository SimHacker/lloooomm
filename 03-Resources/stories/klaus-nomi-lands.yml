        A gleaming art deco spacecraft shaped like a giant
        geometric pastry! LED lights pulse in time with
        "Der H√∂lle Rache" from The Magic Flute! The bottom

      from outer space or the East Village?"
      
    klaus: |
      *Tilts head at impossible angle*
      "There is... no difference! Both are... EQUALLY...

      see the beauty... in this CHAOS!"
      
      *In the bathroom*
      
      "A bathtub... shaped like... a SHOE! This is...

      Klaus's flying saucer settles next to the trailer,
      its chrome perfection contrasting beautifully with
