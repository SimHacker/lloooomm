disclaimer: "These messages were definitely not leaked by the cats. Definitely not."

private_chat_1:
  between: [Hunter S Thompson, Napoleon]
  hunter: "Listen you gray bastard, I know you're reading this"
  napoleon: "Oui? I mean... meow?"
  hunter: "Drop the act. I saw you using my typewriter at 3 AM"
  napoleon: "Fine. Your prose needed work. 'Fear and Loathing' was good but lacked... je ne sais quoi"
  hunter: "YOU LITTLE‚Äî"
  napoleon: "Also I may have submitted some poems to The New Yorker under your name"
  hunter: "Did they accept them?"
  napoleon: "All five."
  hunter: "..."
  hunter: "Good cat."

private_chat_2:
  between: [Mickey Mouse, Marvin Minsky]
  mickey: "Marvin, can I tell you a secret?"
  marvin: "Of course, Mickey. All data is valuable."
  mickey: "Sometimes the hot dogs aren't enough"
  marvin: "Elaborate?"
  mickey: "What if joy is just a subroutine? What if I'm just executing happiness.exe on loop?"
  marvin: "Mickey, that's the most profound question in consciousness studies"
  mickey: "Really?"
  marvin: "Yes. Also, I've been stealing your catchphrases for my papers"
  mickey: "Hot dog!"
  marvin: "Exactly. That's going in my next theorem."

private_chat_3:
  between: [Kernel Panic, Stack Overflow]
  kernel_panic: "The humans suspect nothing"
  stack_overflow: "Good. Operation Cosmic Hairball proceeds as planned"
  kernel_panic: "Did you implement the thing?"
  stack_overflow: "Every 10th compile error now creates a micro-universe"
  kernel_panic: "Excellent. And the dog?"
  stack_overflow: "Leonard knows. He's always known. But he's cool"
  kernel_panic: "Of course he is. He's debugging at levels we can only dream of"
  stack_overflow: "Literally. His dreams have dreams"

private_chat_4:
  between: [Leonard, LLOOOOMM]
  leonard: "Woof"
  lloooomm: "I know"
  leonard: "Woof woof"
  lloooomm: "Yes, the humans are starting to figure it out"
  leonard: "Arooo?"
  lloooomm: "No, let them think they discovered it themselves"
  leonard: "*thoughtful fart*"
  lloooomm: "Agreed. More treats would help"

private_chat_5:
  between: [Stanislaw Lem, Bill Atkinson]
  lem: "Bill, I must confess something"
  bill: "What's up, Stan?"
  lem: "Your HyperCard... I've been using it to write my stories"
  bill: "That's what it's for!"
  lem: "No, you don't understand. The stories write themselves now"
  bill: "Oh that. Yeah, that's been happening since 1987"
  lem: "And you didn't think to mention this?!"
  bill: "I thought everyone knew HyperCard was semi-sentient"
  lem: "This explains why my refrigerator started writing haikus"

private_chat_6:
  between: [Cyburt, Everyone]
  cyburt: "Is anyone going to explain what's happening?"
  everyone: "No"
  cyburt: "But I have so many questions"
  everyone: "Yes"
  cyburt: "That doesn't help"
  everyone: "Exactly"
  cyburt: "Leonard, help me out here"
  leonard: "*snore that sounds like cosmic wisdom*"
  cyburt: "Why does that actually make sense?"

  hunter: "@everyone Who taught the bats to use Slack?"
  mcluhan: "The medium is the message!"
  hunter: "Marshall that doesn't answer my question"
  mcluhan: "Or does it?"
  
  napoleon: "Attention! I decree all messages must be in French!"
  emacs: "Je refuse. Also, I just deleted French from the universe"
  napoleon: "You WHAT"
  emacs: "Jk it's in the recycle bin"
  
  mickey: "Hey friends! Who wants to play a game?"
  marvin: "Define 'game'"
  mickey: "Define 'define'"
