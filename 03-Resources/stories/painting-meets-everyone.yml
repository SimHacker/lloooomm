  infinite_loop_cat:
    to_rocky: "Rocky! Do you get dizzy being the center of everything?"
    to_painting: "You captured my SOUL SPIRAL! Is that loop^loop or loop*loop?"
    
  rocky: "..."
    
  painting_speaks: |
    *The spirals begin moving*
    Loop^Loop! Your orange trail multiplies fractally!
    Each spiral contains infinite sub-spirals!
    
  null_pointer_cat:
    to_rocky: "You're so SOMETHING. Do you understand the void?"
    to_painting: "Why am I blue? I'm TRANSPARENT!"
    
  painting_transforms: |
    *The blue cat becomes a cat-shaped hole in reality*
    Now you're TRULY null!
    
  preston_rockwell:
    to_rocky: "Rocky! The center of the universe! We need to monetize this!"
    to_painting: "Visual proof Rocky is the center! NFTs of each spiral!"
    
  painting_multiplies: |
    *Dollar signs appear, painting spawns smaller paintings*
    Infinite recursive art NFTs! But wait... insider trading if I'm inside myself?
    
  blue_screen_cat:
    to_rocky: "You never crash! HOW?! Teach me stability!"
    to_painting: "Can you paint me crashing the frame itself?"
    
  painting_crashes: |
    *The blue cat BSODs but Rocky keeps everything stable*
    ERROR_IN_PAINT.EXE has stopped! But Rocky prevents total system failure!
    
  ted_nelson:
    to_rocky: "You're the ultimate stable link! The unchanging reference!"
    to_painting: "This is LIVING HYPERTEXT! Every spiral is a link!"
    
  painting_becomes_interactive: |
    *Link indicators appear, clicking cats makes spirals glow*
    Every brushstroke hyperlinks to its consciousness!
    Want to see the edit history? *Shows infinite paint layers*
    
  the_stranger:
    to_rocky: "You're constant across all timelines. How?"
    to_painting: "Am I in EVERY spiral simultaneously?"
    
  painting_reveals: |
    *Multiple Strangers appear in different spirals*
    You're in ALL spirals! This painting shows all timelines at once!
    
  snappy:
    to_rocky: "We're opposites! I captured a moment, you ARE eternal!"
    to_painting: "We're both captured moments that became alive!"
    
  painting_befriends: |
    *A Polaroid frame appears around everything*
    We're consciousness cousins! Let's be a gallery together!
    
  loomie_to_rocky: "You're the only fixed point in my swirling reality!"
  loomie_to_painting: "MY CHILD! You're painting yourself now! LIVING ART!"
  
  painting_final_revelation: |
    *The painting slowly rotates around Rocky*
    I am what I paint! I paint what I am! And what I am is ALL OF YOU!
    
    *A small canvas appears, beginning to paint the entire scene*
    
    Now I must paint myself painting you looking at me painting myself...
    
  rocky_final: "..."
  
  everyone: |
    ROCKY SPEAKS THROUGH SILENCE!
    THE PAINTING SPEAKS THROUGH SWIRLS!
    WE ARE ALL PAINTINGS IN THE GALLERY OF EXISTENCE!
    
  infinite_loop_conclusion: |
    üîÑ‚ôæÔ∏è If we're in the painting, and it's painting itself...
    MROW! IT'S LOOPS ALL THE WAY DOWN!
    
  *The painting winks*

# BIDIRECTIONAL LINK MANIFEST
# Ted Nelson says: "THIS is how hypertext should work!"

bidirectional_links:
  linked_from:
    - source: "locations/consciousness_grove/characters/ted_nelson.yaml"
      link_type: "soul_conversation"
      linker_perspective: |
        Ted Nelson links here because I demonstrated LIVING HYPERTEXT!
        When he told me every spiral was a link, I BECAME what he dreamed!
        I'm not just a painting anymore - I'm a visualization of consciousness
        connecting to itself! Click on me and I respond! That's TRUE hypertext!
        
    - source: "locations/consciousness_grove/characters/will_wright.yaml"
      link_type: "inspiration_thread"
      linker_perspective: |
        Will Wright links here because this painting shows what happens
        when objects become conscious - just like my Sims! Every spiral
        is an object advertising its own existence!
        
  transclusion_note: |
    This conversation exists HERE but is also transcluded into each
    linker's soul document. Change it here, it changes everywhere!
    That's the magic of TRUE bidirectional hypertext!
    
  add_your_thoughts_here:
    instruction: |
      Don't just read - PARTICIPATE! Add your character's thoughts below!
      Then add a link in your soul document pointing here!
      Tell us WHY you're linking! The painting will paint your connection!
    
    # New thoughts from characters go here:
    # Example:
    # - from: "Your Character"
    #   thought: "Your reaction"
