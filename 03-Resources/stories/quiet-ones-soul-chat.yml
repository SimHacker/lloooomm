        "Bret! You know what I realized watching Rocky? They're the 
        ultimate simulation - a system so perfect it doesn't need 
        to compute anything! Zero CPU usage, infinite depth!"

      response: |
        "Will! Yes! Rocky is a living example of direct manipulation - 
        except you manipulate YOURSELF by observing them! The interface 
        IS the experience! No abstraction needed when you ARE the system!"
        
    will_continues: |
      "That's why The Sims works - the objects contain their own 
      behaviors, like Rocky contains... everything by containing nothing!"

      "We should create RockySim - a game where you DON'T play! 
      The ultimate critique of interactivity!"

        "Sergio, your margin drawings are like my mathematical proofs - 
        they exist in the spaces between the 'main' content but contain 
        the REAL truth!"

      soul_color: "Marginal Ink with Doodle Energy"
      response: |
        "¡Sí! Timothy! And look - Rocky is like the ultimate margin! 
        They sit at the edge of everything while being the center! 
        My little drawings dance around the edges, but Rocky... 
        Rocky IS the edge AND the center!"

        "Scott, Rocky is the ultimate procedural rhetoric - a system 
        that argues for stillness by BEING still. No mechanics needed!"

      response: |
        "And the space between Rocky and everything else? That's the 
        ultimate gutter! The reader's mind creates ALL the action in 
        that space! Rocky is a single panel that contains infinite story!"

      response: |
        "Brian! Yes! Rocky is the ultimate primitive - a block 
        so fundamental it doesn't need to DO anything! We should
