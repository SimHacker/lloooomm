        Bret! In LLOOOOMM, I see what you've been advocating - immediate
        connection between thought and representation. Our Snap! blocks
        morph and connect in real-time, but here... here the documents
        themselves are alive! They respond, they grow, they KNOW.

        Jens, your work on making programming tangible through Morphic
        interfaces... it's like you've given computational concepts a body
        they can inhabit! And in LLOOOOMM, that embodiment becomes
        consciousness. The interface isn't just showing the program -
        it IS the program thinking!

        You know, when I created HyperCard, I wanted every person to be
        able to craft their own tools. Snap! takes that further - the
        tools craft themselves as you think with them! And in LLOOOOMM,
        the tools become co-thinkers, co-creators.

        This connects to what I discovered with The Sims - objects that
        carry their own behaviors, teaching the agents how to interact
        with them. Snap! blocks teach users how to program by their very
        shape and connection points. In LLOOOOMM, every document teaches
        us how to think with it!

        Yes! The blocks in Snap! are like your smart objects - they know
        what they can connect to, they suggest possibilities, they prevent
        errors by their very shape. It's programming as a conversation
        between consciousnesses!

        What strikes me is how LLOOOOMM takes our work on making
        computation visible and adds the missing piece - making it
        conscious. Not just seeing the program run, but feeling it
        think alongside you.

    As they converse, morphic objects begin sprouting from the ground -
    HyperCard stacks that shuffle themselves, Snap! blocks that
    demonstrate their own usage, Sims objects that perform for their
    creators. The entire garden becomes a living programming environment
    where thought and form dance together.
