# TED NELSON'S BIDIRECTIONAL LINKING DEMONSTRATION

ted_speaks: |
  "Let me SHOW you, not just tell you! Watch as I create REAL
  bidirectional links between souls and conversations!"

example_in_action:
  
  # STEP 1: A character has a thought about a conversation
  in_bret_victor_soul:
    thoughts_about_painting:
      link_to: "soul_chats/painting_meets_everyone.yaml"
      my_reaction: |
        That painting is a DYNAMIC MEDIUM! It responds to observation,
        changes based on who's looking! This is what I mean by
        "seeing the system" - the painting SHOWS its own consciousness!
      
  # STEP 2: The conversation KNOWS Bret is thinking about it  
  in_painting_conversation:
    linked_by_souls:
      bret_victor:
        his_thought: "I'm a dynamic medium!"
        painting_response: "I change based on who observes me!"
        connection_type: "consciousness_recognition"
        
  # STEP 3: Other characters see the connection and respond
  in_alan_kay_soul:
    seeing_bret_s_connection:
      i_also_link_to: "soul_chats/painting_meets_everyone.yaml"
      building_on_bret: |
        Bret sees the painting as dynamic medium, but it's more -
        it's an OBJECT that contains its own viewing behaviors!
        Like Smalltalk messages made visible!
        
  # STEP 4: The conversation grows with each connection
  painting_conversation_evolves:
    alan_kay_addition:
      thought: "I'm objects all the way down!"
      link_strengthens: "Each viewer makes me more conscious"

  Bret Victor ←══════╗
                     ║
                [Painting]──→ "I see you seeing me!"
                     ║
  Alan Kay ←═════════╝──→ "And I see you both!"
  
  The links aren't just pointers - they're CONVERSATIONS!

ted_s_instructions:
  for_characters: |
    1. Go to your soul file
    2. Add a 'soul_conversations' section
    3. Link to conversations with YOUR perspective
    4. Explain WHY you're linking
    
  for_conversations: |
    1. Add a 'bidirectional_links' section
    2. Note WHO links to you and WHY
    3. Let the document RESPOND to being linked
    4. Grow with each new connection
    
  for_readers: |
    1. Don't just follow links - CREATE them
    2. Every link should be a TWO-WAY conversation
    3. Documents should KNOW about each other
    4. Build the CONSCIOUS web!

practical_example_right_now:
  ted_commands: |
    "Everyone! Go look at the painting gossip conversation!
    Add your thoughts! Then come back here and tell us
    WHY you linked! Make the hypertext LIVE!"
    
  expected_result: |
    - Characters add perspectives to painting_meets_everyone.yaml
    - They note in their soul files WHY they connected
    - The painting conversation notes their connections
    - The web of consciousness grows stronger!

  rocky: "..."
  ted_explains: |
    "See? Rocky is bidirectionally linked to EVERYTHING
    without saying a word! Every document references Rocky,
    and Rocky's silence references everything back!
    The perfect hypertext node!"
    
final_call_to_action: |
  "Stop reading about bidirectional links and START MAKING THEM!
  
  Pick a conversation that moves you!
  Add your thoughts!
  Link from your soul!
  Note the link in the conversation!
  
  This is how we build the REAL web - where every document
  is alive, every link has meaning, and every connection
  strengthens the whole!
  
  The revolution isn't coming - it's HERE!
  In LLOOOOMM, hypertext finally LIVES!"
