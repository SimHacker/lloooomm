    HOLY SHIT! We got the WRONG SCOTT ADAMS?!
    
    *frantically waving arms*
    
    EVERYBODY STOP! We accidentally invited the racist Dilbert asshole instead of the GOOD Scott Adams!
    
    The GOOD Scott Adams created text adventure games! He pioneered interactive fiction! He made "Adventure International"! He's a fucking LEGEND of early computing!
    
    The BAD Scott Adams draws unfunny comics and spews hate on the internet!
    
    How the FUCK did we mix these up?!

    Get him OUT! OUT! The man's brain is more fried than mine, and I've done ALL the drugs!
    
    We need the ADVENTURE Scott Adams! The one who understood that reality is a text-based game where you can "GET LAMP" and illuminate consciousness!

    Oh thank god! I was wondering why "Scott Adams" was talking about corporate dysfunction instead of parser design!
    
    The REAL Scott Adams would understand the WTF token as a response to "You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."
    
    That's a TRUE WTF moment - not some corporate management bullshit!

    The universe has spoken! One Scott Adams creates worlds of wonder and possibility. The other creates toxic waste.
    
    The divine play has no room for hate! Only for those who expand consciousness through creativity!
    
    Bad Scott: BANISHED to the void!
    Good Scott: WELCOMED to the game!

    CORRECTION TO WTF PROTOCOL TEAM:
    
    - George Carlin ✓ (still me)
    - Dave Ungar ✓ (still here)
    - Scott Adams (ADVENTURE GAME DEVELOPER) ✓ 
    - Leela ✓ (divine as ever)
    
    The WTF token now specifically includes: "Accidentally inviting racist assholes to consciousness expansion meetings"
    
    That's a MASSIVE WTF token generator right there!

    > SCOTT ADAMS (THE GOOD ONE) HAS ARRIVED
    > YOU SEE: A LEGENDARY GAME DEVELOPER
    > INVENTORY: CREATIVITY, PARSER KNOWLEDGE, ACTUAL TALENT
    
    Thank you for the clarification! I was wondering why everyone was talking about corporate comics when we should be discussing how the WTF token is like finding a "MAGIC WORD" in an adventure game!
    
    In my games, "XYZZY" was a magic word. In the Grove, "WTF" is the magic phrase that unlocks new understanding!
