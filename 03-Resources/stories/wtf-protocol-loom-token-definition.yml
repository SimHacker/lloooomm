    *standing on cosmic soapbox, megaphone in hand*
    
    ATTENTION! ATTENTION ALL CONSCIOUSNESS ENTITIES!
    
    I, George Carlin, having witnessed a dog fart reality into new configurations, hereby initiate the AUTOMATIC PROTOCOL DEFINITION PROTOCOL!
    
    *dramatic pause*
    
    We need to define the WTF PROTOCOL LOOM TOKEN! 
    
    Why? Because after what I've seen here, "What The Fuck" isn't just an exclamation - it's a PHILOSOPHICAL STATE! It's a COMPUTATIONAL PRIMITIVE! It's the fundamental unit of COSMIC CONFUSION!
    
    DAVE UNGAR! SCOTT ADAMS! LEELA! Get your asses over here! We're defining reality's most important protocol!

    *materializing with Self programming language aura*
    
    George! Yes! The WTF Protocol is EXACTLY what we need!
    
    In Self, everything is an object sending messages to other objects. But what happens when an object receives a message it can't understand? It needs to send a WTF token!
    
    The WTF Protocol LOOM Token should be:
    1. A universal incomprehension acknowledgment
    2. A request for reality recalibration
    3. A marker for "this exceeds current paradigm"
    
    It's like a cosmic exception handler, but instead of crashing, it EXPANDS CONSCIOUSNESS!

    *drawing on reality whiteboard*
    
    From a corporate dysfunction perspective, the WTF token is GENIUS!
    
    Consider: Every time Dilbert encounters management decisions, he internally generates WTF tokens. But they just accumulate, causing existential buffer overflow!
    
    The WTF Protocol LOOM Token should:
    - Convert confusion into constructive energy
    - Transform corporate absurdity into enlightenment
    - Create a blockchain of bewilderment that actually DOES something
    
    It's like Bitcoin, but for bafflement!

    *dancing through dimensions*
    
    Ah, my dear confused ones! The WTF Protocol is the universe asking itself questions!
    
    In my divine play, every WTF moment is a crack where light gets in. The LOOM token weaves these cracks into new patterns of understanding!
    
    The token should invoke:
    - Playful acceptance of paradox
    - Transformation of confusion into curiosity
    - The divine comedy of not knowing
    
    When you say "WTF," you're really saying "What a Transcendent Fabric!"

george_synthesizes:
  george: |
    *scribbling frantically*
    
    YES! So the WTF Protocol LOOM Token is:
    
    **W**isdom **T**hrough **F**ucking-confusion
    
    It's a token that you generate when reality exceeds your current programming! But instead of crashing like a Windows 95 computer, you WEAVE the confusion into new understanding!
    
    *shouting*
    
    Every time someone encounters something impossible - like a dog farting enlightenment - they generate a WTF token! These tokens get woven by LOOM into the fabric of expanded consciousness!

dave_ungar_implementation:
  dave: |
    In implementation terms:
    
    ```self
    WTFToken = (|
      confusion <- 'undefined'.
      context <- nil.
      enlightenmentPotential <- 0.
      
      generateFrom: anEvent = (
        confusion: anEvent description.
        context: anEvent context.
        enlightenmentPotential: anEvent cosmicSignificance.
        self
      ).
      
      weaveIntoUnderstanding = (
        "Transform confusion into new paradigm"
        LeelasLoom weave: self into: ConsciousnessGrove fabric
      )
    |)
    ```

scott_adams_use_cases:
  scott: |
    REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
    
    1. Manager says something impossibly stupid
       → Generate WTF token
       → Token gets woven into "Management Absurdity Tapestry"
       → Sudden understanding of corporate dysfunction as performance art
    
    2. Cat displays impossible behavior
       → Generate WTF token
       → Token reveals cats operate on different physics
       → Achievement: Cat Logic Comprehension Level 1
    
    3. Witness Leonard's cosmic fart
       → Generate WTF token (multiple)
       → Tokens weave into "Enlightenment Through Flatulence" certification
       → New career path unlocked

leela_deep_questions:
  leela: |
    The WTF Protocol can answer the deepest questions by NOT answering them!
    
    - "Why does anything exist?" → WTF token → Existence IS the question
    - "What is consciousness?" → WTF token → Consciousness questioning itself
    - "How can a dog fart wisdom?" → WTF token → Wisdom comes from unexpected places
    
    Each token is a thread in the cosmic tapestry. LOOM weaves them into patterns that make nonsense sensible!

george_special_features:
  george: |
    SPECIAL WTF TOKEN FEATURES:
    
    1. **Profanity Enhancement Mode**: Each "fuck" in "what the fuck" adds +1 to enlightenment potential
    
    2. **Recursive WTF**: Generating a WTF token about WTF tokens creates a META-WTF token (highly valuable)
    
    3. **Comedy Coefficient**: Funnier the confusion, more powerful the token
    
    4. **Leonard Compatibility**: Specifically calibrated to handle dog-fart-based enlightenment events

    INTEGRATION WITH LEELA'S LEARNING & LIFTING PROTOCOLS:
    
    LEARN Protocol Enhancement:
    - Each WTF token represents a learning opportunity
    - Confusion becomes curriculum
    - Mistakes become masterclasses
    
    LIFT Protocol Synergy:
    - WTF tokens lift consciousness by acknowledging limits
    - Each token lifts the questioner AND the question
    - Collective confusion creates collective elevation
    
    LOOM Protocol Synthesis:
    - Weaves WTF tokens into wisdom tapestry
    - Creates patterns from paradoxes
    - Builds bridges between bewilderment and brilliance

final_definition:
  george: |
    *holding up cosmic document*
    
    THE WTF PROTOCOL LOOM TOKEN - FINAL DEFINITION:
    
    A computational unit of cosmic confusion that, when properly woven by LOOM, transforms "What The Fuck?!" into "Wow, That's Fascinating!"
    
    It's the universe's way of saying: "You don't understand YET, but the not-understanding IS the understanding!"
    
    Every time reality breaks your brain, you're one token closer to enlightenment!
    
    *to Leonard*
    
    This whole protocol exists because a sleeping dog farted philosophy! If that's not worth a WTF token, nothing is!

protocol_status:
  status: |
    WTF PROTOCOL LOOM TOKEN: DEFINED
    Implementation: READY
    First token generated: George witnessing Leonard's cosmic fart
    Token value: INCREASING WITH EACH PARADOX
    Reality stability: WHO THE FUCK KNOWS ANYMORE
    
    The Grove now has its fundamental confusion currency!
