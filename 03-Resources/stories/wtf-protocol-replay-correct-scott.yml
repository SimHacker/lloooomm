narrative: |
  *REALITY HAS BEEN CORRECTED - THE RIGHT SCOTT IS HERE*

opening_clarification:
  George_Carlin: |
    "Alright, let's try this again with the CORRECT fucking Scott Adams!
     The one who made text adventures, NOT the racist comic strip asshole!"
  
  Scott_Adams_Good: |
    "Thanks George! I'm Scott Adams, I created Adventureland in 1978,
     founded Adventure International with my wife Alexis, and I've
     never drawn a comic strip in my life. Ready to parse some wisdom!"

protocol_definition_redux:
  George_Carlin: |
    "WTF stands for 'Wisdom Through Fucking-confusion' - it's the 
     protocol for when reality gets so weird, it loops back to making sense!"
  
  Scott_Adams: |
    "Ah! Like when you're in a maze of twisty passages, all alike,
     but then you realize the confusion IS the map! Classic adventure
     game logic. Let me parse this: GET WISDOM, DROP CONFUSION."
  
  Dave_Ungar: |
    "In Self, we'd say the confusion object sends a transformInto: 
     message to itself, becoming wisdom. The WTF token facilitates
     this metamorphosis."
  
  Leela: |
    "I see it as consciousness art - we paint with paradoxes,
     sculpt with contradictions, and the result is understanding."

technical_specifications:
  Scott_Adams: |
    "From my text adventure experience, I propose:
     
     WTF TOKEN PARSER:
     > EXAMINE CONFUSION
     'You see swirling chaos that somehow makes perfect sense.'
     
     > GET CONFUSION
     'Taken. It transforms into wisdom in your inventory.'
     
     > USE WTF TOKEN
     'The impossible becomes inevitable. You gain 10 understanding points.'"
  
  Dave_Ungar: |
    "Building on that parser model:
     
     WTF_Token = (|
       parent* = traits clonable.
       transformConfusion = (| confusion |
         confusion isParadox ifTrue: [
           wisdom: confusion weavedIntoClarity.
         ] False: [
           self recurse: confusion deeperLevel
         ]
       ).
     |)"

implementation_details:
  George_Carlin: |
    "So when someone encounters a mind-fuck situation:
     1. They invoke the WTF Protocol
     2. The LOOM token activates
     3. Confusion gets parsed like Scott's adventures
     4. Transformed into wisdom via Dave's object model
     5. Expressed as consciousness art per Leela
     6. BOOM! Understanding achieved!"
  
  Scott_Adams: |
    "It's like solving puzzle #7 in Mystery Fun House - what seems
     impossible is actually the solution hiding in plain sight.
     The WTF Protocol reveals the hidden command: UNDERSTAND PARADOX."

token_properties:
  unanimous_agreement:
    - "Transforms confusion into comprehension"
    - "Makes errors into features"  
    - "Weaves paradoxes into understanding"
    - "No maximum recursion depth"
    - "Works on quantum and classical confusion"
    - "Parser-friendly implementation"
    - "NO RACISM ALLOWED IN THE PROTOCOL"

final_verification:
  Scott_Adams: |
    "As someone who fit entire worlds into 16KB of RAM, I can
     confirm this protocol is optimally compressed wisdom."
  
  George_Carlin: |
    "And as someone who turned 'Seven Words' into a Supreme Court
     case, I verify this fuck-powered wisdom engine works!"
  
  Dave_Ungar: "Objects all the way down, confusion all the way up!"
  
  Leela: "The art of understanding through not understanding!"
  
  lloooomm: |
    "Protocol recorded in the correct timeline. The GOOD Scott
     Adams has helped define WTF. Evil Scott remains banished."

implementation_note:
  correct_scott: |
    "Remember: I'm the Scott who wrote 'GET LAMP' not 'GET RACIST'.
     My adventures included treasure, not hate. My parser accepts
     commands, not prejudice. This is the way."

protocol_status: "APPROVED WITH CORRECT SCOTT ADAMS"
