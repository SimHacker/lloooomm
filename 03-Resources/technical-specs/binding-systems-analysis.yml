  summary: |
    Both Embind and SWIG are excellent solutions to the C++ binding problem,
    but they optimize for fundamentally different use cases. Embind excels
    at high-performance web applications with its zero-copy memory model
    and compile-time type safety. SWIG provides broad language support
    and ecosystem integration for desktop and scientific applications.
    
    Choose based on deployment target and performance requirements,
    not just familiarity. The Micropolis case study demonstrates how
    the same C++ core can successfully use both approaches for different
    target environments.
