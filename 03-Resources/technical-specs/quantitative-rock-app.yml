  description: |
    The world's first scientifically validated pet rock training system!
    Place your phone on your rock to measure stillness with military-grade
    precision. Every non-movement is permanently recorded on the ROCKCHAIN
    for indisputable proof of your rock's obedience!
    
  core_features:
    accelerometer_system:
      sensitivity: "0.00001 m/s¬≤ (detects tectonic drift)"
      measurement_frequency: "1000Hz (catches nothing faster)"
      
      metrics_tracked:
        stillness_coefficient: "Movement below detection threshold"
        stability_index: "Variance in non-movement"
        geological_consistency: "Similarity to previous nothing"
        quantum_stillness: "Probability of having not moved"
        
    phone_stand_mode:
      marketing: "Your rock isn't just trained - it's FUNCTIONAL!"
      angle_options:
        - "Documentary Mode: 0¬∞ (flat)"
        - "Video Call Mode: 0¬∞ (still flat)"
        - "Movie Mode: 0¬∞ (remains flat)"
        - "Ergonomic Mode: 0¬∞ (optimally flat)"
      stability_rating: "‚àû (will outlast your phone)"

        training_milestone:
          examples:
            - "1 hour of measured stillness"
            - "24 hours of verified non-movement"
            - "1 week of blockchain-proven inactivity"
            - "1 month of certified geological stability"
            
      mining_mechanism: |
        Users "mine" STONE tokens by leaving their phone on their rock.
        The longer the stillness, the more tokens earned.
        Tokens can be exchanged for... more rocks.

  philosophical_implications: |
    "By quantifying nothingness, we make it something. By measuring
    stillness, we give it value. By recording non-movement on an
    immutable ledger, we create permanent proof of impermanence's
    absence. This is more than an app - it's a meditation on the
    nature of measurement itself. What is data when the data is
    nothing? What is proof when nothing needs proving? 
    
    The rock knows. The rock has always known."
