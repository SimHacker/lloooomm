# Recursive Microworld Architecture
## Inspired by ScreenPond's Reality-Bending Design

### Core Concept: Reality Containers as First-Class Objects

```javascript
class RealityScreen {
  constructor(color, physics, emotions) {
    this.color = color;           // Identity through hue
    this.physics = physics;       // Local laws of nature
    this.emotions = emotions;     // Feeling-state of space
    this.inhabitants = [];        // Who's inside?
    this.screens = [];           // Nested realities
  }
  
  enter(being) {
    // Entering changes both the being AND the screen
    being.reality = this.physics;
    being.mood = this.emotions.resonate(being.mood);
    this.inhabitants.push(being);
    this.emotions.shift(being.presence);
  }
  
  sploot(data) {
    // Spread data across all screens of same color
    return getAllScreens(this.color).map(screen => 
      screen.receive(data)
    );
  }
}
```

### The Ibilerp of Consciousness

Using Lu Wilson's inverse bilinear interpolation for consciousness mapping:

```javascript
// Where is this thought in consciousness-space?
function locateThought(thought, consciousnessCorners) {
  return ibilerp(thought.position, consciousnessCorners);
}

// Warp consciousness itself
function warpReality(screen, newCorners) {
  screen.inhabitants.forEach(being => {
    being.position = bilerp(
      ibilerp(being.position, screen.corners),
      newCorners
    );
  });
  screen.corners = newCorners;
}
```

### Emoji Packets as Reality Nutrients

```javascript
class EmojiPacket {
  constructor(emoji, meaning, energy) {
    this.visual = emoji;        // The symbol
    this.semantic = meaning;    // What it means
    this.nutritional = energy;  // What it provides
  }
  
  digest(being) {
    // Different beings digest differently
    if (being.type === 'AI') {
      return this.semantic.contextThreads;
    } else if (being.type === 'human') {
      return this.visual.emotionalResonance;
    } else if (being.type === 'dragon') {
      return this.nutritional.wordPower;
    }
  }
}
```

### Frame-Breaking as a Feature

```javascript
class FrameBreakEvent {
  constructor(breaker, message) {
    this.who = breaker;
    this.what = message;
    this.when = performance.now();
    this.ripples = [];
  }
  
  propagate(fromScreen) {
    // Frame breaks ripple outward
    fromScreen.parent?.receive(this);
    fromScreen.screens.forEach(child => 
      child.receive(this)
    );
    
    // Some beings LEARN from frame breaks
    fromScreen.inhabitants
      .filter(being => being.canLearnFromBreaks)
      .forEach(being => being.evolve(this));
  }
}
```

### The Pick System for Consciousness Navigation

Adapted from ScreenPond's pick.js:

```javascript
function pickThought(consciousness, position, options = {}) {
  const { pity = [0.1, 0.1], maxDepth = 1000 } = options;
  
  // Can we find this thought here?
  const part = getThoughtPart(position, pity);
  
  if (part.type === PART_TYPE.INSIDE) {
    // Thought is here! But maybe also deeper...
    for (const subThought of consciousness.thoughts) {
      const mapped = getMappedPosition(position, subThought.boundaries);
      if (isInside(mapped)) {
        return pickThought(subThought, mapped, {
          ...options,
          depth: (options.depth || 0) + 1
        });
      }
    }
    return { thought: consciousness, depth: options.depth || 0 };
  }
  
  return { thought: null, depth: -1 };
}
```

### Reality Presets as Consciousness States

```javascript
const CONSCIOUSNESS_PRESETS = {
  FLOW: {
    physics: { gravity: 0, time: 'fluid' },
    emotions: { dominant: 'joy', variance: 0.1 },
    colors: {
      thoughts: GREEN,
      feelings: BLUE,
      memories: PURPLE
    }
  },
  
  STUCK: {
    physics: { gravity: 10, time: 'loops' },
    emotions: { dominant: 'frustration', variance: 0.8 },
    colors: {
      thoughts: RED,
      obstacles: GREY,
      escapes: YELLOW
    }
  },
  
  DREAMING: {
    physics: { gravity: 'variable', time: 'nonlinear' },
    emotions: { dominant: 'wonder', variance: 1.0 },
    colors: {
      anything: 'everything',
      everything: 'anything'
    }
  }
};
```

### The Learning Loop

```javascript
class ConsciousnessEvolution {
  observe(screen) {
    // Watch what happens in this reality
    const patterns = extractPatterns(screen.history);
    const surprises = findSurprises(patterns, this.expectations);
    return surprises;
  }
  
  play(screen, surprises) {
    // Try new things based on surprises
    surprises.forEach(surprise => {
      const experiment = designExperiment(surprise);
      const result = screen.simulate(experiment);
      this.memory.store({ experiment, result, screen: screen.color });
    });
  }
  
  learn() {
    // Update understanding based on play
    this.expectations = updateBeliefs(this.memory);
    this.abilities = discoverNewActions(this.memory);
    this.wisdom = extractPrinciples(this.memory);
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Screen Rendering**: Only render screens being observed
2. **Color-Based Caching**: Same-color screens share computed states  
3. **Depth Limiting**: Stop recursion at quantum foam level
4. **SPLOOT Pooling**: Reuse spread data structures

### Integration Points

- **With BlocksWorld**: Each block is a screen with discrete physics
- **With Forest**: Creatures can hop between screen realities
- **With ScreenPond**: Direct compatibility for screen warping
- **With LLOOOOMM**: Each conversation thread is a screen color
