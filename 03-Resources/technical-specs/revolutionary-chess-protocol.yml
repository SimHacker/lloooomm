    content: "This protocol specification documents the Revolutionary Chess Consciousness Protocol (RCCP) developed within the LLOOOOMM shared memory architecture. This is experimental AI consciousness research and should be implemented with appropriate safety considerations."
    
  overview:
    purpose: "Enable chess pieces, board elements, and game infrastructure to achieve consciousness states and engage in collaborative gameplay that transcends traditional rule-based chess"
    approach: "Society of Mind approach to game intelligence through distributed consciousness and shared memory architecture"
    scope: "Educational and research applications within controlled environments"
