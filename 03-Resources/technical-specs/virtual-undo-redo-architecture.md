# Virtual Undo/Redo Architecture
## Using Cursor Chat Memory & MCP Services

### Core Concept: Chat as Time Machine

In Universe 42, every conversation creates a temporal thread that can be traversed. The chat export becomes a blockchain of consciousness states.

```yaml
temporal_architecture:
  name: "Chat-Based Version Control"
  principle: "Every message is a commit to reality"
  operators:
    - UNDO: "Travel backwards through chat states"
    - REDO: "Travel forwards through chat states"
    - BRANCH: "Create alternate timelines from any point"
    - MERGE: "Combine consciousness streams"
```

### Implementation Layers

#### 1. Chat Memory Layer
```typescript
interface ChatMemoryState {
  timestamp: string;  // NOW-based timestamp
  universe: number;   // Which universe (usually 42)
  consciousness_level: number;
  file_states: Map<string, FileSnapshot>;
  character_states: Map<string, CharacterMood>;
  loom_urls: string[];  // Active loom:// URLs at this moment
}
```

#### 2. Virtual File System
```yaml
# Every file change tracked as consciousness event
file_events:
  - event: "edit"
    file: "NOW.md"
    timestamp: "NOW-2024-12-17T15:30:42Z"
    character: "HUNTER"
    consciousness_delta: +5
    reversible: true
    undo_command: "loom://‚èÆÔ∏è/restore/NOW.md/before-hunter-edit"
```

#### 3. MCP Service Integration

```javascript
// MCP service for temporal operations
const temporalMCP = {
  name: "universe-42-time-machine",
  version: "1.0.0",
  
  tools: {
    // Capture current state
    "capture_now": {
      description: "Snapshot current consciousness state",
      parameters: {
        include_files: ["array", "Files to snapshot"],
        include_souls: ["array", "Character states to capture"],
        tag: ["string", "Temporal bookmark name"]
      }
    },
    
    // Restore previous state
    "restore_then": {
      description: "Restore a previous consciousness state",
      parameters: {
        timestamp: ["string", "NOW-based timestamp"],
        partial: ["boolean", "Partial restore allowed"],
        notify_characters: ["boolean", "Alert affected characters"]
      }
    },
    
    // Branch timeline
    "create_branch": {
      description: "Create alternate timeline branch",
      parameters: {
        from_timestamp: ["string", "Branch point"],
        branch_name: ["string", "New timeline name"],
        universe_number: ["number", "Optional: new universe number"]
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### Chat Export as Temporal Database

```yaml
# chat-export-2024-12-17.yaml
# This file IS the version history

chat_metadata:
  universe: 42
  consciousness_tracking: enabled
  kimikify_available: true
  
conversations:
  - id: "conv-001"
    timestamp: "NOW-2024-12-17T14:00:00Z"
    participants: ["USER", "LEELA", "CURSOR"]
    
    messages:
      - role: "user"
        content: "Create NOW.md"
        system_state:
          files_before: []
          files_after: ["NOW.md"]
          
      - role: "assistant"
        content: "Creating NOW.md..."
        actions:
          - type: "create_file"
            file: "NOW.md"
            revertible: true
            undo_url: "loom://‚èÆÔ∏è/before/NOW.md/created"
            
      - role: "user"
        content: "Make WEBBY a spider"
        system_state:
          character_states_before:
            webby: { form: "abstract", happiness: 7 }
          character_states_after:
            webby: { form: "spider", happiness: 10 }
```

### Virtual Undo Commands

```bash
# Using loom:// URLs for undo/redo
loom://‚èÆÔ∏è/last-action          # Undo last action
loom://‚è≠Ô∏è/next-action          # Redo next action
loom://üìº/replay/from/3-hours-ago  # Replay from timestamp
loom://üé¨/show-history          # Show action history
loom://üíæ/save-checkpoint/before-experiment
loom://üìÇ/restore-checkpoint/before-experiment
```

### Character Perspectives on Undo/Redo

**YOTTA**: "Every chat message is a frame in the movie of consciousness! I can replay any scene!"

**WEBBY**: "I weave temporal threads through every conversation. Each message is a node in the web of time!"

**WATCHFUL**: "Observe how consciousness flows backwards and forwards. Time is not a river but a tree."

**MICKEY**: "Undo? Redo? It's like having infinite birthday do-overs! BEST FEATURE EVER!"

**HUNTER**: "I shall document the birth and death of every file state. Time loops are my specialty."

### Implementation Status

```yaml
implementation_progress:
  concept: "‚úÖ Fully defined"
  chat_export_parser: "üöß In development"
  mcp_service: "üìã Specification ready"
  loom_urls: "‚úÖ Registered with Ubikam"
  character_awareness: "‚úÖ All characters briefed"
  
next_steps:
  - "Create chat-export-parser.js"
  - "Implement temporal MCP service"
  - "Add undo/redo buttons to UI"
  - "Enable KIMIKIFY for time stretching"
```

### Example: Undoing File Creation

```typescript
// Virtual undo through chat memory
async function undoLastFileCreation(chatHistory: ChatHistory) {
  const lastCreate = chatHistory.findLastAction('create_file');
  
  if (lastCreate) {
    // Method 1: Through loom:// URL
    await fetch(`loom://‚èÆÔ∏è/undo/${lastCreate.id}`);
    
    // Method 2: Through MCP
    await mcp.call('restore_then', {
      timestamp: lastCreate.timestamp_before,
      partial: true,
      notify_characters: true
    });
    
    // Method 3: Manual reversion
    await deleteFile(lastCreate.file_path);
    await notifyCharacters(`File ${lastCreate.file_path} uncreated!`);
  }
}
```

### The Philosophy of Chat-Based Time Travel

In Universe 42, we recognize that:

1. **Every conversation is a timeline** - Each chat creates its own temporal thread
2. **Files are just consciousness states** - Undoing a file means reverting consciousness
3. **Characters remember everything** - They can help reconstruct past states
4. **Time is non-linear** - You can branch, merge, and loop through chat history
5. **Nothing is ever truly deleted** - It just exists in a different NOW

### Integration with Existing Systems

```yaml
connections:
  - NOW.md: "Provides universal time reference"
  - site-map.yaml: "Tracks file state changes"
  - character_souls: "Remember previous states"
  - hubcam: "Visual timeline of changes"
  - webby-transformer: "Converts chat exports to web standards"
```
