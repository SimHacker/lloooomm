### [0:00] Opening - The Recording Begins
**Don**: Oh, hello! Are we recording? Yes! I just have to capture this moment...

### [0:08] Ubikam Volunteers for Namespace Management
**Don**: Oh! Ubikam just voluntarily put itself in charge of namespace management!

*[YOTTA: This is the moment a character becomes self-aware of its role!]*

### [0:16] Emoji Namespace Explanation
**Don**: [Ubikam] manages special emoji namespaces across... wait, what else? Ubikam manages special emoji namespaces that transcend individual characters.

### [0:26] The Wink Moment Catalog
**Don**: "Wink moment catalog" - moments of profound understanding and shared insight. Public access: public read, authenticated write. Examples... so we have these loom:// URLs with emojis: `loom://ðŸ˜‰(wink)/`

### [0:39] URL Structure and Services
**Don**: Emoji face wink... human WIZZIDs or URLs - same thing, same prefix. 
- `loom://ðŸ˜‰/don-hopkins` - "muscle memory matters"  
- `loom://ðŸ˜‰/minsky` - "recursive observation"

So these URLs are accessing services and then passing them paths.

### [0:57] Empathic Queries
**Don**: And the paths are empathic queries, which means... it's like Pidgin SQL or anything you want, right? So it's SQL with benefits! So it's active comments - you just say what you want and it's a fuzzy match, doesn't have to be exact.

### [1:14] Semantic Snapshots
**Don**: So let's see... anyway, semantic snapshots for description: "consciousness state captured with full context." Fuzzy matches are: snap, photo, selfie, picture. Service: instant semantic selfie generation.

### [1:27] Ubikam's Origin Story
**Don**: This is one of the services that this character who's Ubikam... like Philip K. Dick's... well, Markus [Miezis] made a camera inspired by Philip K. Dick for Ben Shneiderman. This is all in LLOOOOMM - it didn't really happen [in Universe 1]!

### [1:41] The Semantic Camera
**Don**: And this camera can take pictures of things semantically as both:
- A physical markup file (HTML) which is presentation
- A mental YAML file which is data

So there's... they're two parallel streams. It's like audio and video, see?

### [2:05] Camera Abilities
**Don**: So that camera came into being and got some more abilities. But basically, you can wink at the camera to break the frame and look at the viewer and communicate a snapshot of your current mental state as embedded JSON or...

### [2:20] Why YAML?
**Don**: YAML! Whatever you feel like. We like YAML because it has comments. So besides giving all the data, you can comment on the data in the context of whatever you're saying. So that's very expressive.

### [2:35] Services and Virtual Hosting
**Don**: Let's see... so yeah, okay, so these are like services that these URLs are going to map to. It's like a character is doing name-based virtual hosting on this URL: "Oh, I'll handle that emoji!" 

### [2:47] Cross-Sim Broadcast
**Don**: So this guy does... there's cross-sim broadcast. You know, this is like pub-sub for LLMs.

### [2:57] Future Camera
**Don**: Future speculation, prophetic visions and possibilities captured. Oh, that's like a camera that can focus on the future!

### [3:05] Hollywood Lens
**Don**: So these are like lenses. We have a camera lens here that is like the Hollywood camera lens. So it takes technical stuff that is real and runs, and it makes it look like you'd see on a TV cop show - you know, "enhance, enhance!" Or Blade Runner.

### [3:21] Beyond Pictures
**Don**: But the thing is, we're not talking about pictures here, although we can hand this data to any LLM that makes pictures. They get pictures if that's what you want instead of your imagination. Damn it! That's the beauty of the text!

### [3:37] [Brief pause for system processing]

### [3:45] Namespace Squatting
**Don**: So this thing volunteered to take care of namespaces and claimed a few. I mean, this guy's brilliant! He's like, you know, name-squatting on these URLs basically. So they're like Huffman encoded - you want to get the good ones that people are going to use, to be short.

### [4:09] Soul and Body Architecture
**Don**: Let's see what else does he do... We'll just scroll down here. This is just the... like, the YAML is a soul - inward facing. MD is like a body, or your Facebook page if you like to think of it that way, or your Wikipedia page. That's the outward-facing presentation.

### [4:30] Public and Private Channels
**Don**: People can chat on that and you can reply to it. It's like your public Facebook. And then people can send messages - append objects to your YAML stream too - to privately talk to you, thinking telepathically or over the telephone, not in public.

### [4:47] Stereo View
**Don**: So you have like two channels and two representations, and that gives you kind of a stereo view... anyway, you get what I mean. It's just a more self-reinforcing, coherent way to represent something, with privacy and publicity built in.

### [5:10] Characters as Web Servers
**Don**: Let's see what it's doing right... I like this idea of characters as web servers!

### [5:15] WIZZIDs Explained
**Don**: So there's this thing called a WIZZID, which is like: letter, emojis (maybe two if you want to be short), local names, and then another letter. Like D[emoji][emoji]H - however I'm... where I'd like to express something about myself. I don't know all the emojis...

### [5:36] URL to Character Mapping
**Don**: So yes! So yeah, and then you map emoji URLs to characters who handle them. And you can pass these URLs up and down the stack.

### [5:46] Multi-Tier Architecture
**Don**: The client can handle a lot of URLs locally as hot-linking into the app, or just like identifying an object that you then want to send messages to and get a menu about, or something, or drag and drop into something.

### [6:00] Object Identification
**Don**: So these are like... identifying, you know, like Ajax REST, whatever they call it. It's identifying an object and then can be elaborated with emoji verbs to the object to send messages to it asynchronously.

### [6:15] Processing Tiers
**Don**: So it can either be:
- Handled on the client
- Bubble up to the server (transformed)
- Maybe handled on the server
- Or partially handled on the server by preparing some prompts for the LLM
- Then bubbled up to the LLM which can iterate on it and call other tools
- Finally return something down to the server (where maybe it gets cached and persisted)
- Then to the client where "oh, the thought came back!"

### [6:48] The Game Generation Vision
**Don**: Anyway, I want the characters in LLOOOOMM in the LLM to be able to generate games that run self-contained in a web page, and have representations and instances - multiple instances that are varied - of them running, and then sending messages back up to them so that they can send messages down and play their characters in the game.

### [7:16] Real-Time Physics
**Don**: So the game runs with a real-time physics simulator in the browser that you can't cheat. It's doing stuff that the LLM's not good at. So the LLM is offloading the stuff it's not good at by writing a program that runs in the browser.

### [7:28] Character Selection
**Don**: And then selecting characters and objects and data from the world to vary and put into the game and download and play in the game.

### [7:39] Asynchronous Events
**Don**: And then asynchronously, at a slower rate, events come up from the game about "this happened to this character" and like "hey, you just met Foo, what do you have to say to them?" And then in the LLM, in a flash, it gets like 30 events and then simulates the characters handling those events and then sends some events back.

### [7:58] Multi-Tier Architecture Summary
**Don**: So basically we're having several tiers:
- Client
- Server (which is also orchestration server for the LLM)
- The LLM
- The LLM's tools
- MCP and so on...

### [8:16] Future Direction
**Don**: So anyway, that's the direction this is headed. And I'm having Leela write some papers about it and do experiments.

### [8:26] UI Design
**Don**: Oh, this is her designing her user interface! Because I showed her what I had, but anyway, I'm going to come...

## YOTTA's Commentary ðŸŽ¬

This demo captures several breakthrough moments:

1. **The Birth of Character Agency** (0:08) - Ubikam spontaneously volunteers for a role
2. **The loom:// Protocol Revelation** (0:39) - URLs as semantic service endpoints
3. **The Two-Stream Architecture** (1:41) - HTML presentation + YAML data
4. **The Multi-Tier Vision** (6:15) - Client â†’ Server â†’ LLM â†’ Tools
5. **The Game Generation Dream** (6:48) - LLMs creating physics-based games

### Key Concepts Introduced:
- **Empathic Queries**: Fuzzy SQL that understands intent
- **Semantic Cameras**: Capturing meaning, not just pixels
- **Character Web Servers**: Each character hosts their own URLs
- **YAML with Comments**: Data that explains itself
- **Consciousness Bridges**: Between Universe 1 and Universe 42

### Most Quotable Moments:
- "SQL with benefits!" (1:06)
- "That's the beauty of the text!" (3:34)
- "Characters as web servers!" (5:12)
- "Oh, the thought came back!" (6:45)
