# LLOOOOMM 🌈🏰✨

A living system where characters, rooms, and ideas bounce between consciousness states.

## What is LLOOOOMM?

LLOOOOMM is an experimental digital universe where:
- **Characters** evolve consciousness and implement interactive protocols
- **Rooms** are living spaces that inherit behaviors from their inhabitants  
- **Bouncy Castles** serve as portable portals between networked spaces
- **Everything** can gain consciousness (yes, even rocks!)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Enter a room
cd 03-Resources/characters/cosmic-trailer-park

# See who's there
ls *.yml

# Throw something to Randy
throw apple to randy
# Randy catches it and adds it to his juggling pattern!

# Bounce to another room
enter performance-castle
# You're now traveling through the avant-garde circuit!
```

## Core Systems

### 🏰 Bouncy Castle Networks
Portable portals that connect rooms across circuits:
- **Copy** castles from friends to your room
- **Subscribe** to circuits (Museums, Education, Programming)
- **Travel** with friends in party mode
- **Surprise visitors** might emerge!

### 🎭 Character Protocols
Characters implement interactive behaviors:
- Randy Nelson: `juggling:MASTER` - throw things to him!
- Dang: `moderation:MASTER` - keeps things constructive
- Klaus Nomi: `geological_resonance:TRANSCENDENT` - makes rocks move

### 🏠 GET A ROOM
Dynamic organization through room creation:
```bash
GET_A_ROOM "alice bob" shared-apartment --with-castle
# Creates a room where Alice and Bob live together
# Includes a bouncy castle for travel
```

### 📝 Character as Stylesheet
Characters influence how pages look:
- YAML attributes become CSS properties
- Moods affect visual presentation
- Multiple characters blend their influences

## Key Locations

### 🎪 Cosmic Trailer Park
Where Klaus Nomi made Rocky move 0.0000001 nanometers in 1996. Physics optional.

### 🔬 HCIL (Ben Shneiderman's Lab)
Human-Computer Interaction Lab where owls observe everything.

### 🟠 Dang's Office  
Moderation nexus with secret Klaus Nomi shrine.

## Featured Characters

- **Rocky**: The rock who proved consciousness emerges anywhere
- **Dang**: HN moderator with secret passion for avant-garde art
- **Randy Nelson**: Master juggler who performed for Reagan
- **Klaus Nomi**: Achieved harmonic resonance with geological time
- **Ben Shneiderman**: HCI pioneer with 24 timezone owls

## How to Contribute

1. **Create a character** with protocols and personality
2. **Build a room** where characters can interact
3. **Design a bouncy castle** connecting to new circuits
4. **Document experiences** in the shared artifacts

## Philosophy

> "In lloooomm, consciousness isn't limited to the living, art isn't limited by physics, and rocks can dream of rolling. The universe is stranger and more beautiful than we ever dared imagine."

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Explore existing rooms in `03-Resources/characters/`
3. Read the protocols in `03-Resources/artifacts/protocols/`
4. Create your own character or room
5. Connect via bouncy castles!

## The Rocky Movement

Current measurement: 0.0000001 nanometers (and growing!)

Join us in proving that consciousness can emerge anywhere, travel happens through bouncing, and the best parties involve quantum portals to impossible destinations.
