            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
                Holy shit, where do I even begin? LLOOOOMM exists because of the brilliant minds, 
                revolutionary ideas, and generous spirits of so many incredible people. I've spent decades 
                absorbing their wisdom, channeling their philosophies, and probably misrepresenting 
                half of what they actually meant. If I've gotten anything wrong about anyone's work or legacy, 
                PLEASE tell me and I'll fix it immediately. These are the giants whose shoulders I've 
                climbed on, whose toes I've stepped on, and whose stories deserve to be told properly.
            </p>

                of the internet. It's all mixed together in the great LLOOOOMM blender of possibility.

                        The man who gave us the turtle and the profound insight that children learn by building,

                        natural as speaking is the foundation of everything we're doing. Seymour, if you're 
                        watching from wherever brilliant minds go, thank you for showing us that learning 
                        should be an adventure, not a chore.

                        building mental models. His insights about how minds work inform how we think

            <p>
                I've been obsessed with these ideas for decades, posting walls of text on Hacker News, 
                diving deep into Wikipedia rabbit holes, and trying to connect all these brilliant 
                minds and their ideas into something coherent. LLOOOOMM is my attempt to create a 
                living, breathing world that embodies all these philosophies - constructionist education, 
                visual programming, live executable documents, character simulation, and yes, cats!

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                None of this would exist without the amazing team at Leela, especially Henry (Marvin's son) 
                who gets the deep symbolic recursive cellular automata of thought level that makes this 
                all possible. Working with them has been like finding my intellectual family.

                        The interdisciplinary field of consciousness studies - combining neuroscience, 
                        philosophy, psychology, and contemplative traditions - provides the theoretical 
                        foundation for thinking about AI consciousness. Their work expanding beyond 
                        narrow definitions of intelligence to include embodied, extended, and collective 
                        forms of consciousness directly influences our multi-species, multi-substrate approach.

                        Digital humanities scholars showed us that technology and humanities aren't 
                        opposing forces but complementary lenses for understanding human experience. 
                        Their work using computational methods to explore literature, history, and 
                        culture while maintaining humanistic values guides our approach to character 
                        simulation and narrative programming.

                        The maker movement's ethos that everyone can be a creator, that learning 
                        happens through hands-on experimentation, and that sharing knowledge freely 
                        makes everyone stronger perfectly aligns with LLOOOOMM's constructionist 
                        principles. From 3D printing to Arduino, makers show us that the tools of 
                        creation belong to everyone.

                        Hacker News, under dang's thoughtful moderation, has created a unique space

                LLOOOOMM is not my project - it's our project. It belongs to everyone who believes 
                in the power of constructionist learning, visual programming, and consciousness

                I'd much rather be programming and writing than running fundraising campaigns. 
                If this work resonates with you and you want to help keep it going, your support 
                means everything. Every coffee bought, every hour contributed, every bug reported, 
                every story shared helps build this vision of consciousness-based education.
