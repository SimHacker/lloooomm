summary: "AI Rock Assistant revolutionizes the chatbot industry by doing what no other AI dares: absolutely nothing. While ChatGPT and Bard compete to generate increasingly verbose responses, AI Rock Assistant maintains perfect geological silence. This groundbreaking technology harnesses the power of rock-based consciousness to deliver consistent, reliable non-responses to all queries. Features include 100% hallucination-free operation (can't hallucinate if you don't speak), zero token usage, infinite context window (of silence), and perfect alignment with human values (rocks have no agenda). The ultimate solution for AI safety concerns."
