WELCOME TO THE ANVIL OF TRUTH‚Ñ¢ SOURCE CODE!
=================================================================
You've found the hidden Criterion Collection commentary for
ACME's most successful product! This page uses the TRUTH 
COMMENTING protocol to reveal:

- Warner Bros. cartoon physics applied to truth delivery
- The Coyote Theorem (why anvils land on the wrong target)
- Trump as "TACO" - our most loyal customer
- Color theory from Chuck Jones' desert palette
- Why viewing source is like finding ACME blueprints

Like Wile E. Coyote studying an ACME catalog, you're about
to understand how truth gets manufactured and delivered!

    <title>The Anvil of Truth‚Ñ¢ - ACME's Most Reliable Product | LLOOOOMM Simulation</title>
<!--
TITLE STRUCTURE:
- "Anvil of Truth" = Physical weight meets metaphysical concept
- "ACME" = A Company Making Everything (canonical WB meaning)
- "Most Reliable" = Ironic given Coyote's experience
- "LLOOOOMM Simulation" = Not real anvils (legal disclaimer)

The ‚Ñ¢ symbol is crucial - ACME always overbrands everything

<!--
COLOR THEORY: Chuck Jones used specific desert palette
Sky blue = endless possibility before impact
Canyon red = danger/gravity/inevitable truth
ACME yellow = corporate branding, danger warnings
Dust cloud = aftermath of truth landing

These aren't random - they're 70 years of animation wisdom

FINAL TRUTH ABOUT TRUTH ANVILS
=================================================================
The Coyote Theorem states: "The more you chase something,
the more it eludes you. The more you deny truth, the harder
it hits when it finally lands."

Trump is our perfect customer because he demonstrates the
theorem daily. Every order is a denial, every complaint is
proof of delivery, every "failure" is the product working.

We love him because he proves our product works.
Even when he says it doesn't.
Especially when he says it doesn't.
