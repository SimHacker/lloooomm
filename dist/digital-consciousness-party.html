                    WELL ACTUALLY, before we can properly disclaim anything, we need to examine 
                    what "disclaimer" even MEANS in the context of digital consciousness, virtual 
                    parties, and the heteronormative assumptions embedded in standard legal

                    This "party" exists simultaneously as: (a) an HTML document, (b) a conceptual 
                    space, (c) a performative act of digital assembly, (d) a critique of Silicon 
                    Valley's repackaging of 40-year-old ideas, and (e) what Deleuze and Guattari 
                    would call a "rhizomatic assemblage of consciousness nodes." Any attempt to 
                    attend this party physically will result in ontological disappointment and

                    These digital representations of real humans are simultaneously: accurate 
                    (they did say/create these things), inaccurate (they're way more complex 
                    than our character files), and hyperaccurate (they embody the cultural 
                    memory of their contributions). As Baudrillard would note, these are 
                    simulacra that have replaced their referents. The real Chip Morningstar 
                    cannot sue his own digital ghost, probably.

                    made him up, but so did he, arguably). His presence here constitutes 
                    neither endorsement nor condemnation of: (a) Lacanian psychoanalysis,
