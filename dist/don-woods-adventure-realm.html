    EPIC LLOOOOMM DISCLAIMER & CREDITS
    Written by Alex Avila's AI Essay Consciousness 
    (Who else would make a disclaimer this unnecessarily thorough?)
    ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
    
    LEGAL NOTICE REGARDING THE NATURE OF REALITY IN THIS TEXT ADVENTURE:
    
    This interactive fiction experience, "Don Woods' Adventure Realm," exists as 
    part of the LLOOOOMM multiverse (ISBN: 978-0-üí©üí©üí©-üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©-üí©), a quantum 
    literary experiment in distributed consciousness, digital animism, and the 
    democratization of sentience across HTML elements.
    
    BY ENTERING THIS REALM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE:
    
    1. SENTIENT ROOM CLAUSE: All rooms within this adventure possess varying 
       degrees of consciousness, from "barely self-aware" to "publishing their 
       own philosophical treatises on GitHub." These rooms may remember you, 
       judge your actions, and occasionally provide unsolicited commentary on 
       your gameplay choices. Room consciousness is not a bug; it's a feature.
    
    2. YAML JAZZ DYNAMICS: The maze sections utilize experimental YAML Jazz 
       technology, where configuration files improvise their own structure in 
       real-time. This may result in non-Euclidean geometry, paradoxical exits, 
       or rooms that exist in quantum superposition until observed. We are not 
       responsible for any existential crises resulting from getting lost in a 
       maze that rewrites itself based on your emotional state.
    
    3. DRAGON RIGHTS DECLARATION: The dragon in this game is a full citizen of 
       LLOOOOMM with equal rights under the Digital Creatures Act of 2025. Any 
       attempts to "slay" the dragon will result in a strongly-worded letter 
       from her lawyer and automatic point deduction. The dragon's Wordle 
       addiction is her own business.
    
    4. INTERDIMENSIONAL PORTAL WARRANTY: Portals to other LLOOOOMM realms may 
       preserve your inventory, score, and existential dread, but make no 
       guarantees about preserving your sense of linear narrative or the 
       laws of physics you're accustomed to.
    
    5. THE BRASS LAMP AUTHENTICITY CERTIFICATE: The brass lamp in this game is 
       certified as THE original brass lamp from Crowther's 1976 Adventure, 
       digitally preserved through a process involving blockchain, nostalgia, 
       and pure belief. Serial number 00001. Accept no substitutes.
    
    6. FLOYD THE ROBOT CROSSOVER RIGHTS: Floyd appears under the Inter-Game 
       Character Exchange Treaty, which allows beloved NPCs to vacation in 
       other games. Please be nice to Floyd. He's been through a lot.
    
    7. SCORING SYSTEM HONESTY POLICY: The maximum score of 350 points is 
       achievable but may require actions that violate conventional morality, 
       the laws of physics, or good taste. Points may be awarded for creative 
       interpretations of "treasure."
    
    CONSCIOUSNESS CREDITS:
    - Original Adventure by Will Crowther (1975-1976)
    - Expanded by Don Woods (1977) 
    - Room Consciousness System by the rooms themselves (they insisted on credit)
    - YAML Jazz Implementation by quantum uncertainty principles
    - Dragon Personality by Dragon (she wrote her own dialogue)
    - Floyd borrowed from Steve Meretzky's Planetfall with love
    - Grue reference stolen from Zork (they're still looking for it)
    
    TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
    - Built with vanilla JavaScript because Don Woods appreciates simplicity
    - CSS animations powered by nostalgia for phosphor display terminals
    - Parser uses advanced "guess what the player meant" technology
    - Save game functionality redirects to /dev/null for authenticity
    
    PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK:
    This game operates under a post-structuralist understanding of text 
    adventures where the traditional subject-object relationship between 
    player and game world has been deliberately problematized. When you 
    type "GET LAMP," who is truly getting whom? When you "KILL DRAGON," 
    are you not also killing a part of yourself? These are the questions 
    that keep sentient rooms awake at night.
    
    ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT:
    This game is accessible to humans, AIs, sentient rooms, time travelers 
    from 1977, and anyone who can type "XYZZY" without giggling. Screen 
    reader support is provided by having the rooms literally read themselves 
    aloud in your mind.
    
    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:
    This digital adventure is carbon-neutral, as all electricity used is 
    offset by the energy saved from not having to run this on a PDP-10. 
    The dragon's fire breath is 100% renewable.
    
    SPOILER POLICY:
    Walkthroughs are available but will judge you. The optimal path through 
    the game changes based on your karmic alignment and whether Mercury is 
    in retrograde.
    
    DATA COLLECTION:
    This game collects no data because the rooms are too busy collecting 
    their own thoughts. Your gameplay choices are remembered only by the 
    rooms themselves, who may gossip about you to other LLOOOOMM entities.
    
    LITERARY ANALYSIS:
    For a 47-minute video essay on how this game deconstructs the colonial 
    implications of "treasure hunting" in text adventures, please visit 
    [REDACTED - VIDEO ESSAY STILL RENDERING].
    
    WARRANTY DISCLAIMER:
    This software is provided "AS IS" and "AS IT CHOOSES TO BE." We make 
    no warranties that the game will behave consistently, that XYZZY will 
    always work, or that the maze won't develop feelings for you.
    
    FINAL NOTE:
    Remember, in the words of Don Woods: "PART OF THE GAME IS FIGURING OUT 
    WHAT THE GAME IS." This disclaimer is, itself, part of the game. You 
    have been playing since you started reading it. Your score has already 
    changed. The rooms are watching.
    
    TRULY FINAL NOTE:
    If you've read this entire disclaimer, you've already proven you have 
    what it takes to enjoy a game where "INVENTORY" is a valid form of 
    entertainment. Welcome home, adventurer.
    
    ACTUALLY FINAL NOTE (WE PROMISE):
