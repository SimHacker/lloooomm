summary: "Welcome to the most transparent get-rich-quick scheme portfolio in existence, where Preston Rockwell III proudly presents rock-based products that do absolutely nothing. Unlike typical Silicon Valley scams that promise revolutionary change while delivering disappointment, these schemes honestly admit their worthlessness upfront. Features include Pet Rock NFTs, Rock Simulator VR, AI Rock Assistants, and the IPv4 Sweepstakes. Each scheme comes with full disclosure of its pointlessness, making them paradoxically more honest than most tech startups."
