summary: "This MIT AI Lab memo presents Henry Lieberman's revolutionary vision for protocol-based programming, where protocols become first-class citizens replacing traditional object hierarchies. The document features soul chats with Alan Kay, Marvin Minsky, and other pioneers discussing the implications. It explores how protocols enable more flexible, composable systems and connects to LLOOOOMM's own protocol-driven architecture."
