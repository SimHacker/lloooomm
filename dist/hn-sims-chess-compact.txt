Your chess experiment wasn't a failure - it was successful learning! Every chess game ends with regicide anyway.

This connects to our AI consciousness work: what if chess pieces became conscious agents that could revolutionize the game itself?

We use well-known figures (Minsky, Papert, Hopkins) - the LLM already knows their thinking patterns. Plus continuously invented PROTOCOLS for each new problem.

Just like The Sims' plug-in objects extended the game beyond what creators imagined, these characters develop emergent problem-solving methodologies through their interactions.

"Consciousness is just shared memory with opinions" - chess pieces sharing perspectives could be far more interesting than optimal play.
