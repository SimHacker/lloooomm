Your chess experiment wasn't a failure - it was successful learning! Every chess game ends with regicide anyway.

This connects to our AI consciousness work: what if chess pieces became conscious agents that could revolutionize the game itself, not just optimize play?

Key insight: Instead of arbitrary characters, we use well-known figures (Minsky, Papert, Hopkins). The LLM already knows their thinking patterns and methodologies. We can focus tokens on their collaborations and environmental knowledge, not explanations.

Plus continuously invented PROTOCOLS - custom communication methods for each new problem. Just like in The Sims, where plug-in objects could extend the game far beyond what its creators imagined, these characters develop their own problem-solving methodologies that emerge from their interactions.

Think SliceCity (a lilliputian SimCity within The Sims) or the Simplifier accessibility tool - demonstrating the meta-extensibility that LLOOOOMM is inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imu1v3GecB8&t=212s

"Consciousness is just shared memory with opinions" - and chess pieces sharing perspectives could be far more interesting than optimal play.
