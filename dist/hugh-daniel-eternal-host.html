        <h2>The Man with Wings</h2>
        <p>Picture MIT's Tech Square, Building 545, during a Xanadu demonstration. Among the crowd stands a man wearing a cap adorned with actual wings. This was Hugh Daniel, and those wings symbolized his belief that Ted Nelson's Xanadu could make ideas fly.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "First time I saw Hugh, those wings caught my eye. But it was his enthusiasm that caught my heart. He didn't just believe in Xanadu - he LIVED it."

        <h2>The WELL's Beating Heart</h2>
        <p>Hugh was the original sysop of The WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) when it launched in 1985. But he was never just a system operatorâ€”he was the system's soul.</p>

        <p>Before maker culture had a name, Hugh was making fluorescent rice crispy marshmallow birthday cakes embedded with LEDs!</p>
        
        <h3>Hugh's Famous LED Cake Recipe:</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <li>Rice crispies (for structure)</li>

        <div class="quote">
            "Hugh threw a party that happened to be on my birthday. When he found out, he made me a fluorescent rice crispy marshmallow birthday cake with glowing LEDs. Such a Hugh thing to do! It was the last time I saw him. A cherished memory that glows like those LEDs."

        <h2>The GoodNeWS Evangelist</h2>
        <p>On April 21, 1989, Hugh coordinated the public domain release of GoodNeWS, demonstrating his belief in democratizing access to advanced UI concepts.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "Now, what is GoodNeWS? GoodNeWS was a Macintosh Look/Work alike, with a HyperCard, a MacDraw and other goodies that ran as a unique window manager under NeWS."

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Teaching Through Wonder</h2>
        <p>Hugh's approach to education, especially with children, was revolutionary. His teaching philosophy was simple but profound:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eye Level:</strong> Always sit or kneel to be at their height</li>
            <li><strong>Full Attention:</strong> When they talk, NOTHING else matters</li>
            <li><strong>Real Answers:</strong> Never dumb it down, just find better metaphors</li>
            <li><strong>Their Ideas Matter:</strong> "That's interesting, tell me more..."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "I LOVED talking with kids at my parties! They had the BEST questions! I'd sit on the floor with them, ask what they were building, listen to their ideas like they were presenting at SIGGRAPH. Because you know what? Kids see possibilities adults miss!"

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Namespace Guardian</h2>

        </div>
        
        <p>But for kids, he'd explain it differently:</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "Imagine if everyone was named Bob. How would you find your friend Bob? That's why computers need unique names - so they can find each other!"

        </div>
        
        <p>His famous addendum perfectly captured his playful approach:</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "...unless it consents, then fuck away!"

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Connections Across the Community</h2>

        <h2>The Legacy Lives On</h2>
        <p>Hugh Daniel showed us that the measure of a technologist isn't in the code they write or the systems they build, but in the connections they enable and the joy they spread.</p>
        
        <p>As Don Hopkins noted in the MicropolisCore notes:</p>
        <div class="quote" style="color: white;">

        <p>Not gone, just orbital - circling us always, occasionally dipping down to make another connection, throw another party, bake another LED cake.</p>
