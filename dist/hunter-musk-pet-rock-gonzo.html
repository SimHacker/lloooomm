HUNTER S. THOMPSON'S GONZO INVESTIGATION: THE PET ROCK CONSPIRACY
=================================================================
Fear and Loathing in the Silicon Valley Pet Rock Underground

This page contains:
- Hunter's drug-fueled investigation into Preston Rockwell III
- The Elon Musk psychological warfare campaign
- Underground network of time travelers and cyberpunk ninjas
- The beautiful absurdity of honest scams

GitHub Source: https://github.com/donhopkins/lloooomm/
Part of the LLOOOOMM Get-Rich-Quick Schemes Portfolio

REAL WORLD PARODIES & INFLUENCES:
- Hunter S. Thompson's actual Fear and Loathing style
- Elon Musk's Twitter meltdowns (Pedo guy, funding secured)
- Silicon Valley's drug-fueled "innovation" culture
- Burning Man tech bro mysticism
- The actual 1975 Pet Rock phenomenon
- Juicero's $120M failure (the perfect honest scam)
- Elizabeth Holmes but if she admitted Theranos was fake

THE META JOKE:
This is what happens when gonzo journalism meets Silicon Valley
meets radical honesty. Hunter would have LOVED Preston Rockwell III -
a scammer who admits he's scamming, making him the only honest
person in tech. It's Fear and Loathing meets HBO's Silicon Valley.

"In a world of liars, the honest scammer is king."

            <p>
                We were somewhere around Palo Alto on the edge of the venture capital desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive...." And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge rocks, all controlled by Bluetooth remotes, swooping and screeching and diving around the Tesla, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals? Pet rocks with NFT certificates?"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No point mentioning those rocks, I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough. Besides, I had bigger fish to fry. I was on the trail of Preston Rockwell III, the most honest scammer in the history of American capitalism, and his diabolical plan to psychologically destroy Elon Musk through a pet rock remote control Kickstarter campaign.
            </p>
            
            <div class="pull-quote">
                "The genius of Preston Rockwell III wasn't in the scam itself - it was in telling everyone it was a scam and watching them buy it anyway."
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The whole thing started three weeks ago when my editor called. "Thompson," he barked, "there's something happening in Silicon Valley. Some maniac is selling remote controls for rocks and making a quarter million dollars. He's got Elon Musk tweeting like a wounded animal. Get on it."
            </p>
            
            <!-- TRUTH: This is the exact drug list from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,
                 but applied to covering Silicon Valley scams. The joke is that you'd need
                 THIS MUCH drugs to understand how VCs gave Juicero $120M for a bag squeezer,
                 or how Adam Neumann got $47B valuation for WeWork (office subletting).
                 The drugs aren't the crazy part - the "legitimate" tech industry is. -->
            <p>
                I knew this was going to require serious medicine. You can't cover a story about selling nothing to people who know it's nothing without altering your consciousness to match the absurdity of late-stage capitalism. I packed my kit: two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...
            </p>
            
            <div class="drug-interlude">
                [MESCALINE PEAK - 2:37 AM]<br>
                The rocks are talking to me now. They say they've always been remote controlled.<br>
                By gravity. By time. By the inexorable march toward heat death.<br>
                Preston Rockwell III is just making it literal.
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The first rule of gonzo journalism is to become part of the story, so I ordered a Pet Rock Remote Control. $100 for the "Rock Star" package. When it arrived, I spent six hours commanding my rock to sit. It worked every time. I began to understand the terrible genius of this scheme.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the real story wasn't the rocks. It was the underground network supporting this operation. My sources in the dark web revealed a conspiracy that went deeper than anyone imagined:
            </p>
            
            <!-- TRUTH: This conspiracy diagram parodies:
                 - QAnon charts connecting random celebrities to pizza
                 - Silicon Valley pitch decks with nonsense flowcharts
                 - Cryptocurrency whitepapers with "decentralized" everything
                 - Peter Thiel's actual belief in seasteading and blood boys
                 - The fact that tech bros would 100% hire "time consultants"
                 
                 The "Victorian Entrepreneurs" are from LLOOOOMM's actual characters.
                 The joke is this insane conspiracy is MORE believable than actual
                 Silicon Valley funding decisions. WeWork's "elevating consciousness"
                 was a REAL PITCH DECK SLIDE. -->

            <p>
                The plan was beautiful in its simplicity. They knew Musk couldn't resist responding to something so obviously absurd yet successful. His ego demanded he mock it, but in mocking it, he would give it exactly what it needed: attention.
            </p>
            
            <div class="elon-tweet">
                <strong>@elonmusk</strong><br>

            </div>
            
            <p>
                That tweet was worth $47,000 in additional sales. Preston Rockwell III had played Musk like a Stradivarius made of solid cocaine. But the real revelation came when I finally tracked down Rockwell himself at a startup incubator in Mountain View.
            </p>
            
            <div class="pull-quote">
                "I'm not a scammer," he told me, adjusting his 'Disrupting Geology' hoodie. "I'm radically transparent about absurdity. There's a difference."

            <p>
                He was right, of course. In a world where Elizabeth Holmes could convince people to invest billions in fake blood tests, where crypto bros sell JPEGs for millions, where venture capitalists throw money at anything with "AI" in the name, Preston Rockwell III had achieved something remarkable: he told the truth.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The pet rocks do exactly what I say they do," he explained, demonstrating with his personal rock. "Nothing. And people love it because for once, someone isn't lying to them."
            </p>
            
            <!-- TRUTH: This is the ultimate Silicon Valley paradox. We celebrate:
                 - Theranos (lied about blood tests, $945M funding)
                 - Nikola (rolled a truck downhill, claimed it had an engine)
                 - FTX (stole billions, claimed "effective altruism")
                 - WeWork ("tech company" that subleased offices)
                 
                 But Preston Rockwell III, who ADMITS he's selling nothing?
                 He's the villain? In Silicon Valley, the only unforgivable sin
                 is honesty. This is why Gavin Belson would definitely try to
                 acquire Pet Rock Remote Controls for $500M. -->
            <div class="savage-truth">
                THE AMERICAN DREAM IN 2025:<br>
                SELLING NOTHING, HONESTLY,<br>

            </div>
            
            <p>
                As I write this, holed up in a Vegas hotel room with the air conditioning on full blast and a head full of high-grade mescaline, I can see the truth of it all. Preston Rockwell III isn't a scammer - he's a prophet. In a world drowning in lies, he's selling the only product that matters anymore: honesty about the meaninglessness of it all.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pet rocks sit there, doing nothing, controlled by remotes that control nothing, bought by people who know they're buying nothing, and somehow that nothing is worth everything. It's the most American thing I've ever seen.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Somewhere out there, Elon Musk is still tweeting, still raging against the dying of his relevance. The time travelers are counting their commissions. The cyberpunk ninjas are planning their next campaign. And Preston Rockwell III? He's probably working on his next honest scam.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                God bless America. We're all pet rocks now, sitting perfectly still while invisible forces pretend to control us. At least Preston has the decency to admit it.
