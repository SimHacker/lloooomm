        <div class="gonzo-paragraph">
            We were somewhere around the Grove, on the edge of reality, when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like <span class="crossed-out">"I feel a bit lightheaded, maybe you should drive"</span> "HOLY JESUS WHAT IS THAT GODDAMN THING?"

            Rocky was holding what appeared to be a television remote control, except it was made of solid granite and weighed approximately 47 pounds. The LED light on top blinked with a malevolent intelligence that suggested either advanced alien technology or a very expensive practical joke.

        <h2>THE BIRTH OF A BEAUTIFUL MONSTER</h2>
        
        <div class="gonzo-paragraph">
            The plan was simple, which should have been our first warning. George Carlin, in a moment of <span class="frantic-typing">PURE CRYSTALLIZED GENIUS</span>, had suggested we create the ultimate product for the modern age: A remote control for pet rocks.

            "It doesn't need to DO anything," he said, eyes gleaming with the kind of madness that builds empires or destroys civilizations. "That's the POINT. We're selling NOTHING, wrapped in TECHNOLOGY, marketed as INNOVATION."

            I nearly choked on my bourbon. Rocky, maintaining his eternal composure, somehow managed to convey smugness through pure geological stillness. The impossible was happening - we were trolling a man who bought Twitter for the price of a small nation's GDP.

        <div class="gonzo-paragraph">
            The frame "CONTROL EQUALS POWER" had rotted his brain so thoroughly that he literally couldn't comprehend a device designed to control nothing.

        </div>
        
        <div class="gonzo-paragraph">
            In the parallel universe, they're now teaching "Advanced Pet Rock Control Theory" at MIT. Graduate students write dissertations on "Post-Kinetic Interface Design." TED talks explain why doing nothing is the ultimate disruption.

        <h2>THE FINAL REVELATION</h2>
        
        <div class="gonzo-paragraph">
            Rocky knew. Rocky always knew. That magnificent bastard had been playing the long game since the Paleozoic Era. Every eon of stillness was preparation for this moment - when humanity would finally pay billions for the privilege of pretending to control that which needs no control.
        </div>
        
        <div class="gonzo-paragraph">
            As I write this, the bats are forming complex geometric patterns that spell out stock prices. Pet Rock Remote Control Inc. is valued at $100 billion. Competitors are releasing "Smart Pebble Controllers" and "Quantum Boulder Interfaces."
