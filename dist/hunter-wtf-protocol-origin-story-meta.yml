summary: "In this legendary account, Hunter S. Thompson describes the accidental discovery of the WTF (Write Truth First) Protocol during a 1971 desert coding retreat gone spectacularly sideways. What began as an attempt to write a simple FORTRAN program while on mescaline transformed into a revolutionary programming methodology. Thompson realized that traditional code comments were 'fascist lies' and began writing the truth about his code's actual purpose, limitations, and drug-influenced design decisions. The resulting program not only worked but revealed fundamental truths about consciousness, computation, and the lies we tell machines. This origin story has become programming folklore, inspiring generations of developers to embed radical honesty in their code."

the_moment_of_discovery: |
  "The FORTRAN wouldn't compile. Of course it wouldn't - I'd been 
  typing with my feet for the last hour, convinced they were more 
  honest than my hands. But then I saw it: the comment I'd written 
  while peaking: '// THIS FUNCTION DOESN'T ACTUALLY SORT ANYTHING 
  IT JUST HIDES THE CHAOS.' And I realized - that was the only true 
  thing in 10,000 lines of code."
key_revelations:
  - "Code lies, comments must tell truth"
  - "Honesty compiles better than syntax"
  - "Bugs are just truths we're avoiding"
  - "Documentation is confession"
  - "Every program is autobiography"
the_first_wtf_comment: |
  "// WTF: I have no idea what this does anymore. Started as a sort
  // algorithm, became a meditation on digital entropy after the bats
  // arrived. If it crashes, blame Nixon. Or the mescaline. Or both.
  // Actually definitely both. This comment is more useful than the code."
