summary: "The IPv4 Address Sweepstakes represents Preston Rockwell III's most technically sophisticated scam, exploiting genuine concerns about IPv4 address exhaustion to create a lottery for 'winning' your own IP address. This brilliant satire mocks the artificial scarcity of digital resources, the panic around IPv4 depletion, and the tendency to monetize infrastructure problems. Complete with technical jargon, fake testimonials from 'satisfied IP address owners,' and premium tiers for 'cleaner' addresses, this scheme perfectly captures the absurdity of treating network protocols as luxury goods."
