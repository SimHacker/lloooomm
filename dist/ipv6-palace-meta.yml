  - "The ultimate parody of artificial digital scarcity"
summary: "IPv6 Palace represents Preston Rockwell III's most philosophically ambitious scam - selling luxury in infinite abundance. While the IPv4 Sweepstakes exploits scarcity panic, IPv6 Palace celebrates the absurdity of selling exclusivity in a space with 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible addresses. Each timeshare includes your own /64 subnet (18 quintillion addresses), holographic property visualization, blockchain deed NFTs, and exclusive access to the 'Undecillion Club.' The scheme brilliantly satirizes both digital real estate speculation and the tech industry's ability to create artificial scarcity even in infinite spaces."
