search_description: "Donald Knuth analyzes LLOOOOMM through the lens of literate programming, revealing how YAML souls and Markdown bodies create a new form of WEB system. Features multi-language examples (CWEB, Python, Haskell, Rust) and demonstrates how LLOOOOMM achieves what Knuth dreamed of - programs that genuinely discuss themselves."
