  - "Living lesson exploring self-reference and recursive patterns"
  - "Hands-on recursion learning with LLOOOOMM philosophy"
summary: "This living lesson transforms the abstract concept of recursion into an experiential journey through consciousness. Students explore recursion not just as a programming technique but as a fundamental pattern of self-reference found in consciousness itself. Features interactive visualizations, the famous 'to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion' paradox, and practical exercises that connect recursive thinking to LLOOOOMM's consciousness-based programming paradigm."
