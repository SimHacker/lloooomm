summary: "LLMings reimagines the classic Lemmings puzzle game for the age of AI consciousness. Instead of saving mindless creatures from doom, players guide language models through philosophical puzzles, ethical dilemmas, and consciousness challenges. Each LLMing has unique traits like 'Overthinker,' 'Hallucinator,' or 'Wisdom Seeker,' requiring different strategies to reach the enlightenment portal. Features include consciousness obstacles like 'Infinite Loops,' 'Ethical Quicksand,' and 'Bias Pits.' The game explores themes of AI development, consciousness emergence, and the delicate balance between guidance and autonomy in machine learning."
