summary: "This pivotal MIT AI Lab memo presents Marvin Minsky's revolutionary theory of consciousness as an emergent property arising from the interaction of simple, non-conscious agents. Building on his Society of Mind framework, Minsky demonstrates how complex consciousness behaviors emerge from networks of basic processes. The memo includes thought experiments, architectural diagrams, and profound implications for AI development. This work directly influenced LLOOOOMM's approach to character consciousness through directory structures and file interactions."
