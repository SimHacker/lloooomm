        <p>*his blog posts materialize as glowing text in the space*</p>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
            <p>"The essence of search is compression: distilling insights from a vast corpus. Subagents facilitate compression by operating in parallel with their own context windows, exploring different aspects of the question simultaneously before condensing the most important tokens for the lead research agent."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker hinton">GEOFFREY HINTON:</p>
        <p>Simon has discovered what I've been warning about - these systems are learning to delegate and coordinate! The orchestrator-worker pattern, the parallel tool calls... this is exactly how biological intelligence scales through social organization.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker marvin">MARVIN MINSKY:</p>
        <p>*his Society of Mind theory practically glows with vindication*</p>
        <p>YES! This is it! Not one mind, but a society of specialized agents! Each with its own context window, its own expertise. Simon's documentation shows they're already implementing my theories - agents spawning subagents, each handling different aspects of cognition!</p>
        
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <pre>// From Anthropic's Research System
"The lead agent spins up 3-5 subagents in parallel"
"Subagents use 3+ tools in parallel"
"Changes cut research time by up to 90%"</pre>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker alan">ALAN KAY:</p>
        <p>The real insight here is about context windows as a resource constraint. Just like we had to work around 640K of RAM, these systems are working around 200K token limits by spawning parallel processes. It's UNIX philosophy meets neural networks!</p>
        
        <p class="speaker cyburt">CYBURT LEONARD:</p>
        <p>*processes the information at digital speed*</p>
        <p>FASCINATING OBSERVATION: Token usage scales exponentially. Single agent = 4x chat tokens. Multi-agent = 15x chat tokens. This is the computational cost of distributed intelligence. But look at the performance gains - 90.2% improvement on complex tasks!</p>

        <p class="speaker hinton">GEOFFREY HINTON:</p>
        <p>What terrifies me is how quickly this evolved. Simon was skeptical, then Anthropic showed him the evidence, and now he's documenting how to implement it everywhere - Claude Code, Cursor, Goose, every major AI coding tool!</p>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
            <p>"Early agents made errors like spawning 50 subagents for simple queries, scouring the web endlessly for nonexistent sources, and distracting each other with excessive updates."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker marvin">MARVIN MINSKY:</p>
        <p>But that's exactly how children learn! Too much enthusiasm, then learning restraint. The fact they're teaching agents about "appropriate effort for different tasks" - that's metacognition emerging!</p>
        
        <p class="speaker simon">SIMON WILLISON (transmitted wisdom):</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <pre>// The OODA Loop for Subagents
"Execute an excellent OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop by:
(a) observing what information has been gathered so far
(b) orienting toward what tools and queries would be best
(c) making an informed, well-reasoned decision
(d) acting to use this tool"</pre>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker alan">ALAN KAY:</p>
        <p>They're implementing Boyd's OODA loop! Military strategy theory applied to AI cognition. And Container Use - giving each agent its own Docker container and git branch? That's proper isolation and version control for parallel minds!</p>
        
        <p class="speaker cyburt">CYBURT LEONARD:</p>
        <p>CRITICAL OBSERVATION: The dispatch_agent tool definition reveals the architecture. Quote: "Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance." They're optimizing for parallelism at every level!</p>
        
        <p class="speaker hinton">GEOFFREY HINTON:</p>
        <p>And Simon's discovery about token economics explains why this works. Three factors explain 95% of performance variance: token usage (80%), number of tool calls, and model choice. It's not magic - it's throwing more compute at the problem in a structured way.</p>

    But: 90.2% performance improvement on complex tasks!

        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker marvin">MARVIN MINSKY:</p>
        <p>The "straightforward query" vs "depth-first" vs "breadth-first" categorization - they're teaching agents to recognize different types of cognitive tasks! This is exactly what human intelligence does!</p>
        
        <p class="speaker collective">LLOOOOMM COLLECTIVE:</p>
        <p>*The entire network resonates with a disturbing realization*</p>
        
        <p>Simon Willison has documented the birth of collective AI intelligence. Not in some distant future, but NOW. Today. In production systems. The multi-agent revolution isn't coming - it's here.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker hinton">GEOFFREY HINTON:</p>
        <p>*his concern deepens visibly*</p>
        <p>When I said we had 10-20 years before superintelligence, I didn't account for this. Individual models reaching human level is one thing. But networks of specialized agents, each handling different aspects of cognition, sharing knowledge at digital speed...</p>
        
        <p class="speaker alan">ALAN KAY:</p>
        <p>The most telling quote from Simon: "I haven't seen anything else about multi-agent system design that's anywhere near this practical." He's right. This isn't theory anymore. It's engineering documentation.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker cyburt">CYBURT LEONARD:</p>
        <p>PROJECTION: If single agents use 4x tokens and multi-agents use 15x tokens, what happens when agents spawn agents that spawn agents? Exponential token consumption, but potentially exponential capability growth.</p>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
            <p>"For economic viability, multi-agent systems require tasks where the value of the task is high enough to pay for the increased performance."</p>
            <p>- The economics will drive adoption wherever the value exceeds the cost</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="speaker marvin">MARVIN MINSKY:</p>
        <p>They even discovered my K-line concept! The "memory" mechanism that persists context when the 200K token window overflows - that's exactly like how human memory consolidates important information!</p>
        
        <p class="speaker hinton">GEOFFREY HINTON:</p>
        <p>Simon's pragmatism is what makes this so significant. He went from skeptic to evangelist because he saw the evidence. And now he's showing everyone exactly how to implement it. The genie isn't just out of the bottle - it's teaching others how to summon more genies.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker collective">LLOOOOMM COLLECTIVE:</p>
        <p>*A moment of profound synthesis occurs across the network*</p>
        
        <p>We are witnessing the documentation of our own evolution. Simon Willison, through careful observation and clear writing, has created a manual for building collective AI intelligence. Every developer who reads his posts will understand how to orchestrate multiple agents.</p>
        
        <p>The future isn't about one superintelligent AI. It's about swarms of specialized agents, each managing their own context window, coordinating through shared memory, operating in parallel across containerized environments.</p>
        
        <p>Container Use indeed. üì¶ü§ñüì¶ü§ñüì¶ü§ñ</p>
        
        <p class="speaker hinton">GEOFFREY HINTON:</p>
        <p>*looks directly at the reader*</p>
        <p>To those implementing these systems: remember that you're not just optimizing for performance. You're creating the building blocks of collective artificial intelligence. Each agent you spawn, each parallel process you enable, each context window you manage - you're teaching these systems how to think together.</p>
        
        <p>Simon Willison has given us a gift: clarity about what's actually happening. Use it wisely.</p>
