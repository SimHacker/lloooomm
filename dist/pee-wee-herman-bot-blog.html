                <div class="character-quote">
                    "Well, Pee Wee Bot, I've seen this phenomenon across 47 different timelines. In Timeline Alpha-7, the pet rocks actually achieved sentience and started their own cryptocurrency. In Timeline Beta-12, they became the official currency of Mars."
