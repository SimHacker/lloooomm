summary: "Pet Rock Remote Control NFTs represent the pinnacle of blockchain honesty - digital ownership certificates for remote controls that control rocks (which don't move). Each NFT features a unique remote control design with buttons like 'Forward' (doesn't work), 'Backward' (also doesn't work), and 'Turbo Mode' (really doesn't work). This groundbreaking collection satirizes both the NFT craze and the IoT movement by combining them into something spectacularly useless. Smart contracts ensure your remote will never control your rock, gas fees guarantee you'll pay real money for nothing, and rarity traits include button color and how much they don't work."
