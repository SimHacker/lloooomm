            <h2>Chapter 1: The Christmas Vacation (1989)</h2>
            
            <div class="story-box">
                <p>It was December 1989. Guido van Rossum was home for the holidays in Amsterdam. The CWI office was closed, 
                the weather was typical Dutch winter grey, and he was... bored.</p>
                
                <div class="quote">"I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about 
                lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers."</div>
                
                <p>Little did he know that this holiday project would become one of the most beloved programming languages in history.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The ABC Connection</h3>
            <p>Guido had worked on ABC, a teaching language that was beautiful but flawed. It taught him what to do - and more 
            importantly, what NOT to do:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
# ABC was like this (rigid, no escaping):
HOW TO DISPLAY sequence:
   FOR item IN sequence:
      WRITE item

# Python would be like this (flexible, extensible):
def display(sequence):
    for item in sequence:
        print(item)
# But you could also do it YOUR way!</div>
            
            <div class="worm-insight">
                In the LLOOOOMM gardens, we learned that constraints can inspire creativity. Guido took ABC's rigidity 
                and transformed it into Python's flexibility - like a worm that learns to dance by first learning to crawl.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="evolution-era">
            <h2>Chapter 2: The Name Game</h2>
            
            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Why "Python"?</h3>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Python wasn't named after the snake. Guido was reading scripts from 
                "Monty Python's Flying Circus" while developing the language. He wanted something short, unique, and 
                slightly mysterious.</p>
                
                <div class="quote">"I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent 
                mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)."</div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Spam Legacy</h3>
            <p>This Monty Python connection gave Python culture its playful nature:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
# Traditional boring example:
foo = "hello"
bar = "world"

# Pythonic example:
spam = "hello"
eggs = "world"
# Much more fun!</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="evolution-era">
            <h2>Chapter 3: The Benevolent Dictator (1991-2018)</h2>
            
            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>BDFL: A New Model of Leadership</h3>
                <p>Guido became the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" - a term that sounds authoritarian but was actually 
                about responsibility and care. For 27 years, he guided Python with a gentle hand.</p>
                
                <p>The BDFL model meant:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Final say on language decisions</li>
                    <li>But always listening to the community</li>
                    <li>Encouraging debate and dissent</li>
                    <li>Taking responsibility for mistakes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Walrus Operator Wars (2018)</h3>
            <p>The debate over PEP 572 (assignment expressions) became so heated that Guido stepped down:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
# The controversial walrus operator:
if (n := len(data)) > 10:
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected <= 10)")</div>
            
            <div class="quote">"Now that PEP 572 is done, I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a PEP and find 
            that so many people despise my decisions. I'm tired, and need a permanent vacation from being BDFL."</div>
            
            <div class="worm-insight">
                Even in paradise gardens, leadership is exhausting. Guido's stepping down wasn't defeat - it was 
                evolution. Python was ready to govern itself, like a worm colony that no longer needs a single guide.

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>The Hardest Decision</h3>
                <p>Python 3 (2008) broke backward compatibility. It was necessary but painful. The community split:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team Python 2:</strong> "All our code works! Why break it?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Python 3:</strong> "We must fix the mistakes of the past!"</li>
                </ul>

True  # Sometimes...

# Python 3 clarity:
>>> "hello" == "hello"  # Everything is Unicode!
True  # Always!</div>
            
            <h3>The Long Goodbye</h3>
            <p>Python 2's retirement was extended multiple times:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2015: "Python 2 will retire in 2020"</li>
                <li>2020: "No really, it's retired now"</li>
                <li>2024: Some systems still running Python 2 üòÖ</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>NumPy Changes Everything (2006)</h3>
                <p>Travis Oliphant merged Numeric and Numarray to create NumPy. Suddenly, Python could do "real" science:</p>
                
                <div class="code-example">
import numpy as np

# Before NumPy: Lists were slow for math
result = []
for i in range(1000000):
    result.append(i ** 2)

# After NumPy: Blazing fast arrays
result = np.arange(1000000) ** 2</div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Jupyter Revolution</h3>
            <p>IPython (2001) ‚Üí Jupyter (2014) transformed how people think about programming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code + Narrative = Computational Stories</li>
                <li>Science became shareable</li>
                <li>Teaching became interactive</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="worm-insight">
                Jupyter notebooks are like worm trails - they show not just where you ended up, but how you got there. 
                The journey becomes as important as the destination.

                <h3>The Dictionary Ordering Saga</h3>
                <p>For years, dict ordering was "undefined". Then in Python 3.6, it accidentally became ordered. 
                In 3.7, it became guaranteed:</p>
                
                <div class="quote">"The order-preserving aspect of this new implementation is considered an implementation 
                detail and should not be relied upon." - Python 3.6 docs</div>
                
                <div class="quote">"Dict keeps insertion order" - Python 3.7 docs</div>
                
                <p>The community rejoiced! Thousands of hacky OrderedDict uses could be removed.</p>

            <h3>The GIL: Python's Favorite Villain</h3>
            <p>The Global Interpreter Lock - loved by some, hated by many:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Makes Python simpler and safer</li>
                <li>But limits true parallelism</li>
                <li>Countless attempts to remove it</li>
                <li>All have failed... so far</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="worm-insight">
                The GIL is like a garden with only one gate - it keeps things orderly but limits flow. 
                Sometimes constraints that seem limiting actually enable freedom in other ways.

            OH YEAH! From a Christmas vacation project to powering AI, from teaching language

                Python evolved not by abandoning its principles, but by finding new ways to express them. 
                Like worms in the LLOOOOMM garden, it adapted while staying true to its nature. 
                That's the real story of evolution - change and continuity dancing together.
