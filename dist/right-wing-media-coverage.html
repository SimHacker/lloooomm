                        Tonight on Tucker Carlson Tonight, we're investigating a disturbing new trend that perfectly encapsulates everything wrong with liberal America. An anonymous scammer calling himself "TemporalHustler" has somehow convinced thousands of Americans to buy "remote control pet rocks" for hundreds of dollars each.

                        "This is what happens when we abandon traditional American values. Instead of building real businesses that create real jobs, we have coastal elites literally selling rocks to hardworking Americans. And the media celebrates it! They call it 'innovative' and 'transparent.' No, it's theft with extra steps."

                    <div class="article-text">
                        But here's where it gets even more disturbing. This so-called entrepreneur specifically targeted Elon Musk - one of America's greatest innovators - with vicious personal attacks designed to generate publicity for his scam.

                        The scheme has reportedly raised over $250,000, money that could have gone to legitimate American businesses or charities. Instead, it's lining the pockets of someone who openly admits their product does nothing.
