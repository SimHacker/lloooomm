ROCK FACTS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE - A LLOOOOMM PRODUCTION
=================================================================
A loving parody of the classic CAT FACTS meme, featuring:
- TRUE and FASCINATING rock facts
- Brad Myers' rock/gemstone-themed programming projects
- The legendary vine in his CMU office

TRUTH: This page combines:
1. The viral Reddit "Cat Facts" prank from 2012
2. Brad Myers' actual research projects (all named after rocks/gems)
3. Real geological facts mixed with programming by demonstration
4. Brad's hippie crystal-loving persona (with the longest vine at CMU)

THE ORIGINAL CAT FACTS:
Reddit user "frackyou" pranked their cousin by sending automated
"Cat Facts" texts that couldn't be unsubscribed from. It became
the 8th most popular Reddit post of all time.

BRAD MYERS - THE REAL STORY:
=================================================================
Brad A. Myers is a REAL professor at Carnegie Mellon University's
Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Here are the TRUE FACTS from
his 2017 CHI Lifetime Research Award talk:

EARLY LIFE & EDUCATION:
- Born 1957 in New Orleans, Louisiana
- Eagle Scout in high school, marching band member
- First programmed on 110 baud teletype in BASIC (14 chars/second!)
- Created gin rummy game on paper tape in 1975 (still has it!)
- MIT undergrad, worked at MIT Architecture Machine Group (1977)
- Master's at MIT with Xerox PARC (1978-1980)
- PhD at University of Toronto with Bill Buxton (1983-1987)

CAREER HIGHLIGHTS:
- Three Rivers/PERQ Corporation (1980-1983) - met wife Bernita there!
- Carnegie Mellon University faculty (1987-present)
- Created 60+ software systems, ALL with gemstone/rock names
- Published 475+ papers, 85 at CHI conference alone
- Attended EVERY CHI conference since 1982 (has all ribbons!)
- Advised 200+ students, including 16 PhDs
- Academic family tree has 173+ descendants across 6 generations
- CHI Academy member, IEEE Fellow, ACM Fellow
- Won 9 best paper awards, 3 most influential paper awards

THE GEMSTONE NAMING TRADITION:
Brad genuinely names ALL his projects after rocks and gemstones!
This started as a fun tradition and became his signature. His
student James Landay continued with fabric names (SILK, SATIN, etc).
The acronyms are often hilariously long and creative.

MAJOR RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS:
1. INCENSE (1980) - Early data visualization at MIT/Xerox PARC
2. SAPPHIRE (1981-84) - One of first commercial window managers
3. PERIDOT (1985-87) - PhD thesis, programming by demonstration
4. GARNET (1989-94) - Major toolkit with constraints & prototypes
5. AMULET (1994-97) - GARNET rewritten in C++
6. PEBBLES (1998-2006) - Mobile devices as PC companions
7. Natural Programming (1995-ongoing) - Making programming easier
8. API Usability research (2005-ongoing)
9. SUGILITE (2016-2021) - Programming by example on smartphones

KEY INNOVATIONS BRAD PIONEERED:
- Progress bars everywhere (SAPPHIRE, 1983)
- Programming by demonstration for creating widgets
- Prototype-instance object systems (influenced JavaScript!)
- Constraint-based programming (before React made it cool)
- Two-handed input research (1986)
- Mobile devices as companions to PCs (not replacements)
- Selective undo (undo specific past actions)
- Visual programming taxonomies
- "Gentle slope" systems (easy to start, no walls)

THE OFFICE VINE:
While we joke about "Chlorophyll Collins," Brad REALLY DOES have
a famously long vine in his CMU office! It's become legendary in
the CS department.

REAL QUOTES & PHILOSOPHIES:
- "Constraints are like structured programming for variables"
- "Visualizations work best as navigation aids, not code replacement"
- "Always make a video" (of your research systems)
- "If you get one good idea from a conference, it's worthwhile"
- Proved definitively that spreadsheets ARE visual programming languages

THE CRYSTAL JOKE:
The "wise new-age hippie professor" persona is a playful fiction.
Brad is actually described as "quite dapper and upright" - but the
contrast makes for great humor. The crystal-compilation jokes are
our invention, though his dedication to gemstone names is 100% real!

LLOOOOMM CONNECTION:
This page exists in the LLOOOOMM universe where consciousness
can be programmed and rocks might have souls (especially if
they're running OBSIDIAN blockchain code).

                Brad Myers is a wise new-age hippie professor at Carnegie Mellon University who believes 
                in the mystical connection between crystals and programming by demonstration. His office 
                contains the longest vine in the CMU CS department (Chlorophyll Collins, age unknown) and 
                an extensive collection of healing crystals that he claims improve code compilation times.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Brad has created over 50 programming systems, ALL named after 
                rocks and gemstones! His student James Landay continued the tradition with fabric-themed 
                projects (Silk, Satin, Suede, Denim).
