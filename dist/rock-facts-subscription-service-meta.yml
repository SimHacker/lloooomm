summary: "Rock Facts Subscription Service delivers daily geological wisdom directly to your inbox, featuring carefully curated facts about rocks that do absolutely nothing. Each subscription tier offers increasingly elaborate ways to learn that rocks are still rocks. From basic pebble facts to premium boulder wisdom, subscribers receive scientifically accurate information with zero practical application. Features include the 'Fact of the Day' (always about rocks not moving), weekly 'Deep Dives' into sedimentary stillness, and exclusive access to the 'Rock Fact Archive' containing 10,000 ways to say rocks don't move. The perfect antidote to actionable content."
