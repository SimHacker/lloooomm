summary: "Step into the virtual reality revolution of 1995 with ROCK SIMULATOR VR, where cutting-edge technology meets geological stillness. This masterpiece of cyber-satire lovingly mocks the era of Virtual Boy, VRML, and Lawnmower Man by offering players the ultimate VR experience: being a rock. Features include 640x480 resolution, 256 colors of rock, motion sickness-free gameplay (rocks don't move), and multiplayer sitting. A perfect commentary on Silicon Valley's tendency to add 'VR' to everything while delivering the honest truth that rocks provide."
