summary: "RockFit revolutionizes the fitness tracking industry by celebrating what rocks do best: absolutely nothing. This groundbreaking wearable device tracks your stillness score, counts your zero steps, monitors your perfect resting heart rate, and rewards you for achieving peak inactivity. Unlike traditional fitness trackers that shame you for sitting still, RockFit gamifies sedentary behavior with achievements like 'Boulder Mode' and 'Tectonic Stability.' Perfect for rocks, meditation enthusiasts, and anyone tired of being told to move more. Features include infinity-hour battery life (it doesn't turn on), dust-proof design, and competitive stillness leaderboards."
