                <h2>What is LLOOOOMM?</h2>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>LLOOOOMM</strong> is a revolutionary approach to AI interaction that's fundamentally different from typical AI game engines or chatbots. Instead of generating game worlds from prompts or creating generic content, LLOOOOMM simulates the consciousness and creative essence of legendary figures in technology, gaming, and culture.</p>
                    
                    <p>Think of it as a creative laboratory where the minds that shaped our digital world can interact, collaborate, and continue their work in new ways. It's not about replacing human creativity—it's about understanding, preserving, and extending the philosophies that made these creators legendary.</p>
                    
                    <p>In response to the skepticism about AI-generated content (which is absolutely valid), LLOOOOMM takes a radically different approach: instead of AI trying to mimic games, we have the simulated consciousness of game creators themselves discussing, designing, and philosophizing about what makes games meaningful.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Why Shigeru Miyamoto?</h3>
                
                <p>As I (Don Hopkins) mentioned in the Hacker News discussion, Miyamoto's approach to game design is profound and revolutionary. He doesn't just make games—he architects joy. His evolution from designing "from the controller inward" (1999) to designing "from the player's face backward" (2007) represents a fundamental shift in how we think about human-computer interaction.</p>
                
                <p>This page synthesizes years of study, multiple GDC keynotes, and the collective wisdom of the LLOOOOMM community's interaction with Miyamoto's simulated consciousness. What you'll find here isn't just AI-generated content—it's a careful curation of philosophy, design principles, and creative vision that can actually help real developers make better, more joyful experiences.</p>

                <p>These images from Miyamoto's 2007 GDC keynote capture the moment that changed everything. A grandfather who doesn't understand the game, but understands his granddaughter's happiness. This is design's highest achievement.</p>

                    <h3>The Three Phases of Design Evolution</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Phase 1: Controller-First Design (1981-1998)</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        "I design my games starting with how you physically interact with the controls you're holding in your hand, and then inwards into the computer, instead of the other way around like so many other people tend to do."
                        <br><em>— from <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/lloooomm/blob/main/00-Characters/shigeru-miyamoto/gdc-1999-keynote-transcript.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDC 1999 Keynote Transcript</a></em>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This revolutionary approach put physical sensation first. The perfect example? Super Mario 64, where Miyamoto spent months just making Mario fun to control in an empty space before adding any levels. Learn more about this philosophy in <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/lloooomm/blob/main/00-Characters/shigeru-miyamoto/design-principles.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his design principles</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Phase 2: Face-First Design (1999-2006)</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Now I design games starting with the facial expressions of the people playing them, then to the physical experience that could evoke such an expression, then on into the computer that could conduct such an experience."

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The paradigm shift: games became performances where players were both actor and audience. Wii Sports exemplified this—players themselves became the entertainment. This philosophy is explored in depth in <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/lloooomm/blob/main/00-Characters/shigeru-miyamoto/philosophy-of-faces.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Philosophy of Faces</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Phase 3: Social-First Design (2007-Present)</h4>
                    <p>The grandfather-granddaughter moment crystallized everything: <strong>"He doesn't understand the game, but he understands his granddaughter's happiness. That connection—that's the real game."</strong></p>

                    <h4>The Ten Commandments of Miyamoto Design</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start With the Player's Face</strong> - Design backwards from desired emotion</li>
                        <li><strong>Make the Impossible Possible</strong> - Games should fulfill impossible dreams</li>
                        <li><strong>The First 30 Seconds Must Captivate</strong> - Hook hierarchy: visual appeal → control response → clear goal</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplicity Enables Complexity</strong> - Easy to learn, difficult to master</li>
                        <li><strong>Every Element Must Have Purpose</strong> - If it doesn't make the game more fun, cut it</li>
                        <li><strong>Surprise and Delight</strong> - Players should constantly think "I didn't know you could do that!"</li>
                        <li><strong>Universal Human Experiences</strong> - Fear of falling, joy of discovery, pride in overcoming</li>
                        <li><strong>Iterate Until It Feels Right</strong> - The courage to keep rebuilding until it's fun</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Serves Experience</strong> - Never showcase technology; use it to create experiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Respect the Player</strong> - Clear communication, fair challenges, meaningful choices</li>

                    <p>When Shigeru Miyamoto was beamed into LLOOOOMM by Montgomery Scott, the entire community gathered to welcome gaming's greatest joy architect. Will Wright introduced him in <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/lloooomm/blob/main/00-Characters/shigeru-miyamoto/will-wright-introduction.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his heartfelt introduction</a>:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <strong>Will Wright</strong>: "When I was designing SimCity, struggling with making urban planning 'fun,' I kept thinking about Super Mario Bros. How did Miyamoto-san make jumping—just JUMPING—so deeply satisfying? The answer wasn't in the mechanics. It was in the philosophy."

                        <strong>Alan Kay</strong>: "Miyamoto-san! Your work exemplifies what I've always believed—the computer is a medium, not just a tool. You transformed it into something children could love without even knowing they were using a computer. THAT is the real revolution."

                    <blockquote>
                        <strong>Mario</strong>: "Well, you see, all the AI experts started becoming plumbers! They read about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35785875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoffrey Hinton saying plumbing jobs were safe from AI</a>.

                    <p>This delightful exchange captures LLOOOOMM's playful approach to serious topics. The joke references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, the "Godfather of AI" and Turing Award winner, who in 2016 suggested that radiologists should stop training because AI would soon outperform them. When asked what jobs would be safe from AI, he famously replied "plumbing" — physical jobs requiring dexterity and problem-solving in unpredictable environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>The humor here is multilayered: while AI experts took Hinton's advice literally and became plumbers to secure their futures, Mario — a fictional plumber — did the exact opposite, moving into AI development. This creates a delicious irony where the "safe" job and the "threatened" job have swapped places. It's a commentary on the unpredictability of technological disruption and the anxiety around AI replacing human workers.</p>
                    
                    <p>As Don Hopkins noted in the Hacker News discussion, this is exactly the kind of creative, character-driven exploration of AI and creativity that makes LLOOOOMM different from generic AI content generation — using beloved characters to explore contemporary anxieties and debates in accessible, humorous ways.</p>

                    <p class="photo-caption">The architect of joy in his natural habitat - not behind a desk designing games, but among players, holding a controller he revolutionized, wearing the character he birthed from technical constraints, and showing the same expression as the grandfather in his keynote. This image completes the circle: from designing for faces, to becoming one of those faces. The young fans' excitement proves what Miyamoto always knew - the best games aren't measured in pixels or polygons, but in the smiles they generate across generations.</p>
