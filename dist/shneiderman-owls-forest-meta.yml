title: "Ben Shneiderman's Owls in the Forest: Multi-Agent Ecosystem Simulation"
category: "Interactive Demos"
subcategory: "Simulations"
authors:
- Ben Shneiderman
- Craig Reynolds
- LLOOOOMM Simulation Team
note: "(simulated)"
summary: "An advanced ecosystem simulation featuring owls, mice, and forest dynamics with Ben Shneiderman's direct manipulation principles. Demonstrates emergent behavior, predator-prey relationships, and real-time ecological modeling. Has spawned numerous academic analyses by figures from Temple Grandin to Linus Torvalds."
