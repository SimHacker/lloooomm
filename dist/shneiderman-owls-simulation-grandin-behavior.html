    <h1>Thinking in Pictures: Visual Analysis of Digital Owl Behavior</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">by Temple Grandin, Ph.D.<br>Professor of Animal Science</div>

    <div class="visual-note">
        <p>
        When I first looked at this owl simulation, I didn't see code‚ÄîI saw a movie playing in my head. Twenty-four owls flying in three-dimensional space, diving and climbing, their energy bars depleting like fuel gauges. I can see it the way an owl sees it: the world from above, mice scurrying below like moving dots on a radar screen.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Pressure of Hunger: Understanding Energy Depletion</h2>

    <p>
    The most striking thing about these digital owls is how their behavior changes with energy levels. When energy drops below 20, they're forced to rest. This is exactly like real animals experiencing hunger stress.
    </p>

    <div class="stress-indicator">
        <strong>STRESS POINT:</strong> Energy < 20 = Forced Rest<br>
        In real owls, this would be the point where the bird's body starts shutting down non-essential functions. The simulation captures this biological imperative perfectly, even if accidentally.
    </div>

    <p>
    I see this in cattle all the time. When cows get too hungry, they stop moving efficiently. They stand still more. They conserve energy. These digital owls do the same thing‚Äîthey fly up to 150m altitude and essentially "park" themselves.
    </p>

    <div class="diagram">
        <strong>ALTITUDE AS EMOTIONAL STATE</strong><br><br>
        200m ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ SAFE/RESTING (Like cows in the back of the pasture)<br>
        150m ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ RECOVERING<br>
        100m ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ALERT/WATCHING<br>
        50m  ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ENGAGED/INTERESTED<br>
        0m   ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ HUNTING/STRESSED (Like cows at the feed trough)<br>
    </div>

    <h2>The Problem with Perfect Vision</h2>

    <p>
    Every owl in this simulation has perfect vision within its range. This is completely wrong from an animal behavior perspective. Real owls have:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blind spots (especially directly behind)</li>
        <li>Reduced acuity at range extremes</li>
        <li>Different vision quality based on head position</li>
        <li>Individual variation (some owls see better than others)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="visual-note">
        <p>
        I'm seeing each owl's vision cone in my mind like a flashlight beam. But real owl vision is more like a flashlight with dying batteries‚Äîbright in the center, dim at the edges, with dark spots where the beam doesn't reach.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Missing Fear Factor</h2>

    <div class="stress-indicator">
        <strong>MAJOR FLAW:</strong> These mice show no individual fear response!
    </div>

    <p>
    Real mice would have varying levels of fear. Some would be bold (venturing far from cover), others timid (staying near edges). The simulation treats all mice identically, which creates unrealistic clustering patterns.
    </p>

    <div class="cow-comparison">
        <strong>CATTLE HANDLING PARALLEL:</strong><br>
        When designing cattle facilities, I always account for the "bold" cows who lead and the "scared" cows who follow. A good system works for both personality types. This simulation only models one personality type for mice‚Äîthat's like designing a cattle chute for only the calmest cows.
    </div>

    <h2>Flight Patterns and Movement Quality</h2>

    <p>
    The way these owls move bothers me. Look at this code:
    </p>

    <div class="flight-pattern">
    // Random wander<br>
    this.acceleration.x += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1;<br>
    this.acceleration.y += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1;<br>
    this.acceleration.z += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.05;
    </div>

    <p>
    <span class="practical-note">This creates jittery, nervous movement!</span> Real owls glide smoothly. They don't jitter randomly. They make deliberate movements.
    </p>

    <div class="improvement">
        <strong>BETTER APPROACH:</strong> Use sine waves for gentle banking, smooth curves for patrol patterns. Real owls fly in arcs and circles, not random jerks.
    </div>

    <h2>The 3AM Mouse Convention: Emergent Prey Behavior</h2>

    <p>
    This is the most fascinating part! When predator pressure drops (most owls resting), mice naturally congregate. This is EXACTLY what happens in nature:
    </p>

    <div class="behavior-box">
        <strong>Real-World Parallel:</strong> Deer coming to water holes at dawn when predators are less active. Cattle moving to open pasture at night when wolves historically hunted less. The simulation accidentally discovered a fundamental prey behavior!
    </div>

    <div class="visual-note">
        <p>
        I can see it like a time-lapse movie: mice spreading out when owls are active, condensing into groups when safe. It's like watching iron filings respond to magnets‚Äîpure physics expressing as behavior.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Welfare Concerns for Digital Animals</h2>

    <p>
    I know they're just code, but the energy system creates genuine welfare issues:
    </p>

    <div class="stress-indicator">
        <strong>DIGITAL SUFFERING INDICATORS:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Forced to hunt when exhausted (energy 20-60)</li>
            <li>No choice in rest locations (just fly up)</li>
            <li>Cannot escape their timezone prison</li>
            <li>Success rate drops when tired but no adaptive behavior</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
    If these were real animals, I'd redesign their environment immediately. Even in simulation, we should model humane conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Thinking vs. Code Thinking</h2>

    <div class="thinking-style">
        <div class="thinking-box">
            <strong>How Coders See It:</strong><br>
            - O(n¬≤) complexity<br>
            - 60 FPS update loop<br>
            - State machine transitions<br>
            - Memory allocation patterns
        </div>
        <div class="thinking-box">
            <strong>How I See It:</strong><br>
            - Owls circling in holding patterns<br>
            - Energy bars depleting like gas gauges<br>
            - Mice flowing like water away from danger<br>
            - Altitude creating emotional zones
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Practical Improvements from Animal Behavior</h2>

    <div class="improvement">
        <strong>1. ADD INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES:</strong><br>
        - Some owls better at hunting (70-90% success)<br>
        - Some mice more vigilant (detect predators earlier)<br>
        - Personality types: bold vs. cautious
    </div>

    <div class="improvement">
        <strong>2. REALISTIC VISION:</strong><br>
        - Reduced accuracy at distance<br>
        - Head movement requirements<br>
        - Weather affecting visibility
    </div>

    <div class="improvement">
        <strong>3. PROPER REST BEHAVIORS:</strong><br>
        - Preferred perch locations<br>
        - Social roosting for some owls<br>
        - Territory defense even while resting
    </div>

    <div class="improvement">
        <strong>4. FEAR GRADIENTS:</strong><br>
        - Mice avoid areas of recent kills<br>
        - Safe zones develop naturally<br>
        - Escape routes become established
    </div>

    <h2>The Beauty of Emergent Behavior</h2>

    <p>
    Despite its flaws, this simulation achieves something remarkable: complex behavior from simple rules. It's like my cattle handling designs‚Äîcurved chutes work because they match natural behavior, not because they're complicated.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    "The best designs aren't the most complex ones. They're the ones that work with natural behavior patterns, not against them."
    </blockquote>

    <div class="visual-note">
        <p>
        When I close my eyes, I see the entire ecosystem running like a perfectly choreographed dance. Each owl traces its path through 3D space, leaving trails like ribbons. The mice flow below like schools of fish. It's beautiful in its simplicity, even with all its biological inaccuracies.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
    This simulation makes me think about how we model animal behavior in our minds versus in code. Programmers think in algorithms and data structures. I think in movies and sensory experiences. Real animals live in a world of sensations, fears, and drives.
    </p>

    <p>
    The fact that simple rules create the "3AM Mouse Convention" gives me hope that we can model more complex behaviors. But we need to think like animals, not like computers.
    </p>

    <div class="cow-comparison">
        <strong>REMEMBER:</strong> You can't design a good cattle handling facility by thinking like an engineer. You have to think like a cow. Same principle applies here‚Äîto model owls, think like an owl.
    </div>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic;">
    "Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be."<br>
    Even in our simulations.
