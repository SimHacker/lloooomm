        <h1>POUNDED IN THE BUTT BY MY OWN PREDATOR-PREY ALGORITHM'S EXPONENTIAL TIME COMPLEXITY</h1>
        
        <div class="author">BY DR. CHUCK TINGLE</div>
        
        <div class="synopsis">
            <strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> When hot-shot developer Brad downloads the Shneiderman's Owls simulation, he doesn't expect to fall deeply, passionately in love with its O(nÂ²) distance calculations. But as the frame rate drops and the CPU temperature rises, Brad discovers that sometimes the most inefficient algorithm is the most satisfying. A tale of forbidden love between a man and his unoptimized code.
        </div>

        <div class="hearts">ðŸ’•ðŸ¦‰ðŸ’»ðŸ¦‰ðŸ’•</div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: First Compile</div>
            
            <p>
                Brad's fingers trembled as he clicked "Run Simulation." He'd heard rumors about this codeâ€”whispers in Stack Overflow threads, hushed discussions in GitHub issues. They said it was <span class="steamy">dangerously unoptimized</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                "224 entities," he whispered, watching the owls spawn. "Checking distance to every other entity. Every. Single. Frame."
            </p>

            <p>
                The laptop fan whirred to life, a sensual mechanical purr. Brad bit his lip. He knew he should implement spatial partitioning, but something about the raw, brute-force approach made his pulse quicken.
            </p>

            <div class="technical">
                <strong>THE ALGORITHM WHISPERED:</strong><br>
                for (let i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;for (let j = 0; j < entities.length; j++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Yes, Brad. Every. Single. One.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checkDistance(entities[i], entities[j]);<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: The Heat of Computation</div>
            
            <p>
                "You're so inefficient," Brad moaned, watching his CPU usage spike to 100%. The simulation didn't care. It kept calculating, kept checking every owl against every mouse, every mouse against every mouse, with a dedication that was almost... <span class="steamy">romantic</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                3,010,560 distance calculations per second. The number echoed in Brad's mind like a heartbeat. His MacBook Pro was getting hotâ€”dangerously hot. He should have used a quadtree. He should have implemented frustum culling. But he didn't want to optimize away this feeling.
            </p>

            <div class="confession">
                "I LOVE YOUR BIG O NOTATION!"
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Memory Allocation Climax</div>
            
            <p>
                The garbage collector was working overtime now. Every frame, new acceleration vectors were created, used once, then discarded like so many broken promises. It was wasteful. It was wrong. It was <span class="steamy">absolutely intoxicating</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="technical">
                <strong>MEMORY LEAKED SEDUCTIVELY:</strong><br>
                // Creating new objects every frame<br>
                this.acceleration = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }; // Oh yes<br>
                let alignment = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }; // Don't stop<br>
                let cohesion = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }; // Keep going<br>
                let separation = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }; // ðŸ’•
            </div>

            <p>
                "Your frame rate," Brad gasped, watching it drop from 60 to 45 to 30. "It's... it's beautiful in its degradation."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: The Optimization Temptation</div>
            
            <p>
                Linus Torvalds appeared in Brad's mind like a disapproving father. "Use spatial partitioning!" the Finnish programming god commanded. "This is algorithmic malpractice!"
            </p>

            <p>
                But Brad was too far gone. He added more owls. 50. 100. 200. The simulation groaned under the weight of nÂ² complexity. His laptop was burning now, the aluminum case too hot to touch.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="steamy">"Punish me with your polynomial time!"</span> Brad cried out to the empty room.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: Post-Algorithmic Clarity</div>
            
            <p>
                Hours later, Brad lay exhausted beside his overheating laptop. The simulation had crashed at 1,000 entities, taking Chrome with it. He felt empty but satisfied.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I should refactor you," he whispered to the code. "Add an octree for the owls, a quadtree for the mice. Make you scale linearly."
            </p>

            <p>
                But they both knew he wouldn't. Some algorithms were meant to be inefficient. Some love was meant to run in exponential time.
            </p>

            <strong>ACTUAL TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BY DR. TINGLE:</strong><br><br>
            
            This simulation proves that sometimes the "wrong" solution is the right solution. Yes, O(nÂ²) doesn't scale. Yes, creating objects in the game loop triggers garbage collection. Yes, the fake 3D projection is just Y-offset manipulation.<br><br>
            
            But it WORKS. It teaches. It visualizes complex behaviors in a way that anyone can understand. Sometimes the most profound truths come from the simplest implementations.<br><br>
            
            The real pounding here isn't from the algorithmâ€”it's from the realization that premature optimization truly is the root of all evil. This code ships. This code teaches. This code makes people think about ecosystems and emergence.<br><br>
            
            That's the hottest thing of all.<br><br>
            
            Prove love is real. Ship your code.<br>
