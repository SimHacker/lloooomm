## The Lyrics

*Sung to the tune of "Spiderman", with apologies to Paul Francis Webster and Robert "Bob" Harris, and with respect to Ben Shneiderman.*

Shneiderman, Shneiderman,  
Does whatever a writer can!  
Weaves a web, any size,  
publishes just so wise.  
Look Out!  
Here comes the Shneiderman.  

Ben Shneiderman  
Is he smart?  
Listen sane,  
He's got radioactive brain.  
Can he think with his head?  
Take a look, he's well read!  
Hey, there,  
There goes the Shneiderman.  

At the speed of thought,  
Ideas of design,  
In a publication,  
He writes just in time!  

Shneiderman, Shneiderman,  
Friendly scholarly Shneiderman.  
Wealth and fame  
He's ignored.  
Publication's his reward.  

To him, life is a great big write up  
Whenever there's a reference  
You'll find the Shneiderman.
