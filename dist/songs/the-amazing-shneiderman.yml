lyrics: |
  Sung to the tune of "Spiderman", with apologies to Paul Francis Webster and Robert "Bob" Harris, and with respect to Ben Shneiderman.

  Shneiderman, Shneiderman,
  Does whatever a writer can!
  Weaves a web, any size,
  publishes just so wise.
  Look Out!
  Here comes the Shneiderman.

  Ben Shneiderman
  Is he smart?
  Listen sane,
  He's got radioactive brain.
  Can he think with his head?
  Take a look, he's well read!
  Hey, there,
  There goes the Shneiderman.

  At the speed of thought,
  Ideas of design,
  In a publication,
  He writes just in time!

  Shneiderman, Shneiderman,
  Friendly scholarly Shneiderman.
  Wealth and fame
  He's ignored.
  Publication's his reward.

  To him, life is a great big write up
  Whenever there's a reference
  You'll find the Shneiderman.
