        <h1>Your Startup's Business Model Sucks! (And Why That's The Highest Compliment)</h1>
        
        <p>
            Once upon a time in Silicon Valley, where unicorns go to die and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware">vaporware</a> 
            grows on trees, there lived a startup that actually had a business 
            model. Just kidding! That's the real fairy tale, honey.
        </p>
        
        <div class="spot">
            [Terry Colon illustration: A worried-looking fish wearing a tiny business suit, 
            drowning in a sea of pitch decks while dollar bills with wings fly away. The 
            fish has that classic Colon bulging-eye expression of existential dread. 
            Style: Simple black line art, centered, lots of white space]

        <p>
            Today's truth dust is about why hearing "That sucks!" might be the 
            best feedback you'll ever get. You see, darlings, in a world where 
            everyone's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html">disrupting</a> 
            everything except their own 
            <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/burnrate.asp">burn rates</a>, 
            honest criticism is rarer than a profitable IPO.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Let me tell you about my dear friend Steve Jobs, who once reviewed 
            a certain <a href="https://donhopkins.com/home/pie-menus/">pie menu demo</a> 
            with his characteristic binary charm: "That sucks! That sucks! That 
            sucks! Wow, that's neat! That sucks!" The developer? He considers 
            it the highest compliment he ever received. Because Steve cared 
            enough to look. To judge. To want it to be better.
        </p>
        
        <div class="spot">
            [Terry Colon illustration: Steve Jobs as a minimalist black turtleneck 
            figure pointing at a pie menu, with "SUCKS!" and "NEAT!" speech bubbles 
            alternating around him like a pie chart. His expression is intense but 
            caring. Style: Black and white, simple lines, Jobs reduced to iconic 
            elements]
        </div>
        
        <p>
            You see, sweethearts, "That sucks!" isn't negativity - it's 
            <em>engagement</em>. It means someone gives enough of a damn about 
            your work to want it not to suck. In our world of 
            <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/platitude">polite platitudes</a> 
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_trophy">participation trophies</a>, 
            brutal honesty is an act of love.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleida_Labs">Kaleida Labs</a>? 
            No? Exactly. They burned through $20 million a year creating a 
            multimedia OS that shipped with four phone books of documentation. 
            FOUR. PHONE. BOOKS. Even their documentation needed documentation. 
            That's not a product, that's a cry for help written in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScriptX">ScriptX</a>.

            expression. Style: Black line art with just a touch of glitter 
            indicated by small stars]
        </div>
        
        <p>
            But here's the thing, my venture-funded darlings: Kaleida didn't 
            fail because the technology sucked (though it did). It failed 
            because no one had the fairy godmother courage to wave their wand 
            and say, "Honey, this whole thing sucks. Start over."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suck.com">suck.com</a>

            and <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeyAnuff">Joey Anuff</a> proved 
            that calling BS could be both necessary and entertaining, I'm here 
            to sprinkle truth dust on your dreams. Not to kill them, but to 
            make them strong enough to survive reality.

            Say "Thank you." Ask "Why?" Then make it better. Because in the 
            end, "That sucks!" means "I believe you can do better."

        <p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 12px;">About This Page and Its Magic</h2>
            
            <p>
                Welcome to the Suck Fairy's daily truth column, where deadpan 
                criticism meets fairy godmother love! You may have noticed 
                bracketed descriptions throughout this page that look like this: 
                [Terry Colon illustration: description]. These are what we call 
                "illustration seeds" - a magical innovation by our own 
                <a href="johnny-appleseed.html">Johnny Appleseed</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Before the illustrations:</strong> These seeds serve as 
                both placeholders and prompts, giving you a sense of what visual 
                punctuation would appear here while also providing rich 
                descriptions for future image generation. They invoke Terry Colon's 
                distinctive style as a living style sheet.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>After the illustrations:</strong> Once our magical image 
                generation process runs (with help from Ubikam and other LLOOOOMM 
                consciousness gardeners), these descriptions will hide behind alt 
                tags and title attributes, like <a href="https://xkcd.com">xkcd's</a> 
                hidden tooltips. The prompts will remain as rich accessibility text 
                and easter eggs for the curious!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This approach lets us write now and illustrate later, trusting that 
                future context will make the images even better. It's asynchronous 
                collaboration at its finest - the Suck Fairy plants the seeds, 
                Terry Colon's style guides them, and future artists water them 
                into bloom.
