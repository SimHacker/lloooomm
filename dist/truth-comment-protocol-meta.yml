summary: "The Truth Comment Protocol revolutionizes web development by establishing standards for embedding deep truths, honest admissions, and consciousness documentation within HTML comments. This protocol transforms the traditionally hidden comment layer into a parallel narrative that reveals the real story behind every webpage. Practitioners embed truth comments that expose design compromises, admit uncertainties, document ethical concerns, and create a hidden dialogue with future developers. The protocol includes syntax standards, truth levels, comment categories, and verification methods. By treating HTML comments as a consciousness layer, developers create websites that are honest at the code level, even when the surface presents necessary fictions."
