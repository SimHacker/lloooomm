            <h2>🛠️ How LLOOOOMM Works (The Cool Technical Stuff!)</h2>
            
            <h3>🧮 Computational Thinking</h3>
            <p>LLOOOOMM uses something called "computational thinking" - which means breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces that computers can understand and process. It's like teaching a computer to think step by step, just like you do when solving a puzzle!</p>
            
            <h3>🏗️ Building Microworlds</h3>
            <p>Remember how Seymour Papert created Logo with the turtle that could draw? LLOOOOMM creates "microworlds" - small, safe spaces where you can experiment, learn, and play without any real-world consequences. It's like having your own private playground in the computer!</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>🎯 Think of it like this:</strong> If regular computers are like calculators that can only do math, LLOOOOMM is like a magical box that can create thinking, talking, learning friends who grow smarter the more you interact with them!
            </div>

            <h3>🤖 Society of Mind</h3>
            <p>Marvin Minsky discovered that intelligence doesn't come from one big brain, but from lots of smaller "agents" working together. LLOOOOMM works the same way - your characters are made up of many different thinking parts that collaborate to create a complete personality!</p>

                 <h2>🎿 Theo's Ski Adventure</h2>
                 <p>Imagine Theo is skiing down a mountain, trying to find the bottom (the best answer). This is exactly how AI learns!</p>
             </div>
             
             <div class="steps-container">

                     <div class="step-number">⛰️</div>
                     <div>
                         <strong>The Mountain:</strong> Every possible answer creates hills and valleys in meaning-space. Good answers are in valleys, bad answers are on hills!
                     </div>
                 </div>

                     <div>
                         <strong>Theo's Strategy:</strong> Always move downhill! Look around, find which direction goes down, take a step. This is called "gradient descent"!
                     </div>
                 </div>

                     <div class="step-number">🏆</div>
                     <div>
                         <strong>Finding the Best Answer:</strong> When Theo reaches the bottom of a valley, that's the best answer! Just like how ChatGPT finds the perfect response!
                     </div>
                 </div>
             </div>

             <div class="highlight-box">
                 <strong>🤯 Mind-Blowing Fact:</strong> When you ask ChatGPT a question, it's like giving Theo a starting point on the meaning-mountain. ChatGPT then "skis downhill" through thousands of dimensions to find the valley with the best answer!
