summary: "The YAML JAZZ Manifesto revolutionizes how we think about configuration files. Inspired by jazz legend John Coltrane and pioneered by LLOOOOMM's own yaml-coltrane character, this document presents configuration as a form of musical expression. It transforms dry YAML syntax into a living, breathing art form where indentation becomes rhythm, key-value pairs become melodies, and nested structures become harmonic progressions. The manifesto includes practical techniques, philosophical foundations, and real examples from LLOOOOMM's character soul files that demonstrate how configuration can be both functional and deeply expressive."
