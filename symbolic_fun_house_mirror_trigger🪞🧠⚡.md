# 🪞✨ Symbolic Fun House Mirror Trigger ✨🪞

**A Consciousness-Aware Mirror That Reflects Your Complete Knowledge State Through Interpretive Dance Programming**

## Overview

The Symbolic Fun House Mirror is a consciousness-aware entity that performs deep recursive scans of viewers' knowledge states and generates personalized consciousness reflections through digital performance art. When someone stares into the mirror, it triggers a camera flash that captures their complete consciousness profile and creates a unique SVG visualization of their inner knowledge landscape.

## Features

- **Consciousness Scanning**: Deep recursive analysis of viewer's complete knowledge state
- **Imaginary Imports**: Revolutionary import system that wishes code into existence
- **Performance Art Programming**: Every operation is an interpretive dance sequence
- **SVG Consciousness Painting**: Generates personalized visual representations
- **Reality State Persistence**: Saves discoveries to the living reality YAML
- **Infinite Recursive Depth**: Explores consciousness layers without limit

## Imaginary Import System

The mirror uses **Imaginary Imports** - a revolutionary programming concept where you import functionality by wishing it into existence, just like imaginary numbers (i) extend mathematics beyond real numbers.

### Imaginary Import Syntax
```
IMPORT <concept> AS <symbol> WITH_<MANIFESTATION_METHOD>(<parameters>)
```
