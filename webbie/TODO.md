## 🎪 THE VISION

**"A chess game where every piece has a mind, every move tells a story, and every game becomes a lesson in strategy, philosophy, and human-AI collaboration."**

This TODO represents the roadmap to realizing Don Hopkins' vision of seamless character control, Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind, Will Wright's emergent behavior, and the LLOOOOMM gang's collaborative creativity.

**Next Action:** Start with testing the Python HTTP-MCP server and creating the basic chess board interface.
